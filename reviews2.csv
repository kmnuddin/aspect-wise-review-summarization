Great charger.  I easily get 3+ charges on a Samsung Galaxy 3.  Works perfectly for camping trips or long days on the boat.
"Super thin, lightweight, and non intrusive. Feels amazing, isn't add protective as other cases but I get to enjoy and show off my phone more."
Very cheap case. This not protect anything. Very fragil.!! After i got it I went to buy a otter case expensive but worth it.
We love these headphones. We had a pair each for our 2 and 4 year old. They loved them and thought it was great that they could share one device but each have their own set of headphones. Very comfortable as well.
"Initial review after having this Kinivo for 48 hours?  This has been what I've been searching for the last few years trying to use a system to sync up my calls and music.  I've used the motorola tx550 (terrible), Satechi Soundfly BT, and numerous other failed devices.  I was not only able to set this up in literally under a minute, I was later able to completely hide all the wires under my dash which made me even happier.<br /><br />I will periodically update on this device."
"Great cords!! 10ft cords for this price? And they all work just fine, will buy these again!"
"Excellent addition to my alcatel one touch pop 7 ,,, case is attractive and we'll made, the keyboard works great with my tablet .. this product brings my tablet to a new level"
"Daughter couldn't go down the river without her phone, so we had to get a case.  This worked perfectly. Not so big that it was hard to carry, and kept the water out!  She keeps it in the bathroom now and uses it when she takes a bath.  Glad it works!"
"This product is nicer that I was expecting.  And, arrived early!"
the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars was that it was super tough to get on and off the phone. other than that it's a solid case and it worked to expectation. i dropped my phone a few times while using this case and the case held up.<br /><br />i was given this case at a discounted rate in return for an unbiased opinion.
"It's okay. I like the dreamcatcher graphic a lot. The case itself is very thin and the edging on her sides is not seamless. The edges have a small plastic &#34;tail&#34; that is left over from when the case was cut. It's not horrible but it is noticeable and annoying.<br /><br />Not sure what I expected though, afterall its $5."
"I'm not going to tell you that you should buy this phone, I'll givethe pros and the cons and let you decide for yourself Pros &#34;Durable&#34;    I don't know if Lg of America purposely makes they're phones in America easy to break the screen but this one Right here is a champion. Dropped this on cement, Hard Tile floor, on the sidewalk, and a few Other non carpeted areas. I don't know if it's the construction itself that makes it strong or maybe that LG Of Korea purposely made this phone very strong since it's marketed to teens and younger folks, or maybe it's because every time you dropped the phone instead of it's falling all in one piece and absorbing all the Impact, the back comes off and the battery comes out oftentimes but when you put it back together it works fine. I even had a few front facing dropS so many times I thought oh my God this is it my phone is shattered but I was wrong I am so confident in this phone that I Could do a ear height drop test anytime anywhere and I'm 100 percent sure it won't break and I'm 5ft 10. I don't even have a case on it it's just the screen protector and that's it.  Good Conversation starter (The Eyes)  you have no idea how many conversations have started Because of this.  Me: *Takes my phone out of my pocket to see notifications*  Her: &#34;Omg, does your phone have eyes? Thats sooo cute&#34;  Me:yeah, it's a lil phone from Korea. The Lg aka. check it out it's eye's move too. It even blinks too Her: Thats so adorable, Im ******* by the way.  Continue talking and i ended up getting so many kiks/phone number because of that but i digress. (It's Still Corvette over females doe) A great way to break the ice.  Audio  The Sounds sounds great coming through the speakers no cracking or nothing like that, it's not super loud but if you put it at full volume here and enjoy it even if you're a good distance away. earbuds, it works with every pair of earbuds I have very compatible. Crisp .plus with the LG software their version of the music app you have the option to increase t, the treble, all that. I love that features some songs just don't sound the same without all that bass.let's see what else can I say about the sound? the notifications can be nice and loud. And yeah if you're really into music this is a great phone.  Design   if you are coming from some other company and you're used to the buttons on the sideit'll take a little while but eventually you'll get used to the volume rockers and power button being on the back. and if you don't want to have to deal with that this phone has knock knock you tap on the screen twice to wake it up and then you can enter your password and all that instead of using the little button on the back. and most of the time you can use the littles options At top to adjust the volume but as I said before it's pretty easy To get used to. Plus the phone looks nice, its not ugly.  Call quality The call quality is decent. I thought since this phone was from overseas the call Quality might be off but now it's on point. Texting works normally too .  The speed  if you are used to be mid-range phones, this is quite a little Speedy One.   The Flex factor  lots of people buy Phones As fashion statement, the question is if my  put his galaxy/iPhone/Note/ on the table and you put yo phone next to theirs how would it stack up? I would give this phone a 7. Its pretty nice and if you keep it clean(its easy,every not and again wipe wit a lil rubbing alcohol) you can flex on anyone. Looks like one of them $700 Flagships. If yo guy friends see the eyes however they might clown ya. But that don't matter. The eyes are cool to me and that's all that matter.  Security Lots of options to keep it safe. Bunch of lock options and it has lookout too.at least mine did you might have to install it.  accessories  If you like customization this phone comes with funny lil stickers to put on it. If you older you might not care but i found this cool.  Weight  Its not heavy. I likes this.   OsThe operating system is Kitkat, I personally like KitKat. it gets the job done and it doesn't have too many features that I'll never use thatll just drain my battery.  Memory   16 gigs of internal space . And thats good considering my other phone before this had 8 . Up to 32 gb with a memory card but I used a 64 gb chip and it's worked fine.  Auto focus lazer  Cool feature on the camera very useful. And it can shoot high resolution video  Battery   lasts a while. I can get 6 hours wifi on heavy use but if the brightness is at 100 you lose some up time. And if yiu get a replacement battery you can just switch it out bam.  Cons  Camera isn't highest quality. Kinda grainy.  Not waterproof/Water resistant. Thats how my broke. Not broke but it's messed up pretty bad.   Price. Depending on what color you get this can go up to be 300 dollars, them Amazon vendors tryna rip y'all off this a $200/$250 Phone don't be rash wait till the price go down.  Front facing camera is not that great either but you can see so its not complete trash.  Too much stuff. Too many apps pulling on the ram makes it studder occasionally. Not bad but you'll notice it.   5 inches. I came from 4.7 in, i though well .3 in isn't that big of a jump but I was wrong, sometimes I have difficulty reaching the top of the screen to pull down my notification thing. Not the phone fault my hands just wasn't  for 5 in.   Micro sim. I had a regular sim. But its alright T-Mobile switch it and gave me a new one free.  I lied at the start. You should buy this if you think it's cool"
"&#34;This a great looking and highly functional case for the iPhone 6.It is a nice solid construction and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone.The case is a little stiff and not that easy to separate.You need to follow the instruction carefully.You should  remove screen protectors at first.<br />You are advised to test the case for waterproofness by placing a piece of paper in the case then dunking it in water. This I did with no problems, the paper was bone dry All the ports are sealed with stoppers so it should be completely sealed.<br />The buttons were still easy to press with the case on and the fingerprint sensor works perfectly;<br />All in all, I like this case and recommend it. &#34;"
I liked the macro lens the most. So sharp! I gave it 4 stars because the wide angle had so much vignette. But this thing is totally worth the money! Works in Sony Xperia z3 compact.
"Fantastic case. Looks slick as can be. The hard buttons remain fully functional. Only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that the case is very difficult to remove, and also, the input for the charger will not fit all chargers. Otherwise, it's a beautiful case."
"They sounded okay, they had plenty of the skipping that is all too well known with bluetooth headphones, very difficult for me to get the right fit with these. I wanted to like these headphones, but the Blue Buds X were just a hands down winner, the Blue Buds just have too many better features to go with freedoms instead. Durability wise, only time will tell. But these freedoms weren't as good sounding to me, the ear hooks were not as comfortable as I was expecting, I also prefer the Blue Buds due to their smaller size. The price is higher, I bit the bullet and bought them and I am so much happier with them than I was with the cheaper alternatives. I use the Comply Foam Tips and they improve any set of headphones dramatically in My opinion."
"Fits perfectly. Saved my iPhone from getting damaged quite few times, forcing me to keep using.<br />Though the case is a lot slippery i liked it more than the leather one I bought at Apple Store.<br />Looks not compromised.<br />Phone feels lot slimmer. No weight added.<br />Overall great case :)"
Case is pretty decent nice snug fit on my phone but the kick stand on the phone is really difficult to use.
Not what I expected at all.  Online description misleading.  Gave it away for my son to play with  don't waste your money
"Doesn't work on my iPad Air. Would not advised purchasing this product. I have tried different charging bricks and it's the same thing, I get a message that my iPad is not charging."
"This case did not work with aftermarket charger cords; but to clarify they did work with my cords purchased from Apple. I had to notch out the openings a bit to get the aftermarket cord to fit. Otherwise, durable and dependable."
Great case! Fits perfectly even with a tempered glass screen protector. It does add bulk to the phone but makes it easier to carry which is a huge plus :) Lime green is a fantastic color.
After seeing and using ours a friend asked that I get one for her as well - This is a great charger and a great buying experience.
The part that connects to the tablet broke after the first use. No kidding. The part that is important is actually the weakest part. I was so disappointed. The cord looked so high quality and beautiful.
Fast delivery.  Easy to apply!
"Good cassette adapter.<br />My husband and I just bought a Subaru OUtback 2002 with CD and cassette players.<br />We were afraid to try this to plug our cell phones into the car stereo, because some reviews say that it completely damaged the car sound system, but so far, we've been using for 4 days and , it has been working in a very good way.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like, which prevented me for putting 5 stars, it was a small interference sound when I move the cell phone. That is all."
Good product.  Please note that it is not a floating case.  They don't claim it is but I somehow was thinking it was.  It is a good price and does what it says.
"It took a little time for me to write this review because I prefer to try a product out completely over time. I did have a problem with the cable, the camera would shut off when the car was in motion and I would have to screw around with the connector to get it to turn on again, after a few miles it would shut off again, this was corrected when I notified the company which promptly sent me a new cable. The problem now seems to be fixed. About the camera itself...it's a really good little camera, the picture is really clear and the colors are very natural. This camera rivals many more expensive models. Take a look at the YouTube videos, they speak for themselves. The only problem I have (with any of these cameras) is, the setting buttons are really small, for a man's hands that can be a problem, but other than that I really don't have any other complaints with this camera. It does what it was designed to do. The company is really nice to deal with if you do have a problem, like with any electronic device, things can and do go wrong sometimes, but this company responds quickly to rectify a problem which keeps their costumers happy. Over all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this very reasonably priced camera to any one looking to purchase a car camera. When an accident happens, and they do, it's nice to have a visual account to protect yourself. This is a very sensible purchase for anyone."
"Works as described.  I bought it to have earphones with some noise blocking capability for use on a tractor.  I have ear-bud phones which block noise and these block better with better sound and no more gooey-squishy-sweat in my ear canals.  I have paired it with 2 tablets (one android, one Windows) and my phone all easily.  Good sound quality. Does not block enough outside sound to serve as hearing protection, nor would I expect it to, but it is close and works well for my needs in a tractor which isn't very loud.<br /><br />Pros:  Good sound quality.  Voice notifications lets you know on/off/pairing.  Comfortable (fits fully over my ears).  Range; I tried pairing to my phone when outside ready to hit the tractor and it wouldn't do it....came to realize it was still connected inside to my tablet which I had to go inside to disconnect.  Nice compact case.<br />Cons:  At this price point I can't complain.  The USB charger cable is unique and may be difficult to replace (USB to mic jack). They feel &#34;flimsy&#34; but then that means they are lightweight and comfortable for work-use or long games.<br />Unknowns:  I haven't run the battery dead yet to know run time; at least a few hours.  Microphone; haven't tried it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  when these wear out I will get another pair.  I will probably buy two more for my kids for road trips as they have systematically destroyed the &#34;wire&#34; with each wired set that I have bought them."
Didn't realize it has an internal fan.  Pretty noisy.  Embarrassing to use in conference room with others.
Great case...but when i clean my home phone button with awesome spray it touches lil bit of casing frame and all suden change color for that particular part
"This case for the GoPro is perfect for two cameras and accessories. It will protect your gear very well without weighing you down, especially if you are traveling."
"I ordered one and it's really pretty I love the decoration but within one day of having it, the corner was cracked and I didn't even drop my phone. So I ordered the free replacement and I had it for about a week an it's already chipped out of the bottom corner and again, I haven't dropped my phone."
"Did not test if it is actually waterproof but this case is very flimsy. The door for the charger port snapped off and the plastic base cracked. I went through two of these in a month. For a better quality case, get an Otterbox. If you want to take pictures underwater, just get a waterproof camera. I wouldn't risk breaking a $600 phone but if you want to..."
love this product. Protected my phone for 2 years without peeling off. Had to change my phone and this is the first thing I bought for it. Must have!
"This mount is excellent. Easy to use, stays in place without any slipping (about two weeks of use at this point), and could clearly accommodate most types of phones. Highly recommended."
"Works and looks great. Charging is a bit slow, but I use it to charge my phone overnight on the night stand."
"Good goggles without the frill of the later versions.  I have not compared to other cardboard goggles, but I would guess these are relatively high quality lenses, with plastic frames instead of cardboard.  I did not have any problems using them.  The lack of a visor to block outside light was not an issue.  I did feel a little carsick, though.  Because of the carsickness, I do not regret the lack of a headband.  My arms do not get tired from holding the apparatus for the short periods I feel comfortable using it.  And it feels more natural to be holding it to your face while turning around, rather than relying on a headband to hold cardboard against your face."
Works for 3 months and tip of cable stock in my phone. Contact saler told me have to ship the defectid item and then they raplace it. Not worth to buy
"I wish the bottom and top edges were a little more rigid, but the case works great. Fits great and very slim."
I have been concerned about radiation (EMF and EMR) for some time now. This product blocks the radiation and was inexpensive and effective. I am very satisfied.
"If I could, I will give it 0 star. I bought 2 days ago and was very happy to receive today. But when I opened it and found it was made in 2013. After installation, the battery was 34% full, 30 minutes later, it became 14% full. Then I used IbackupBot to check and found the battery already has 508 count cycles.  I can accept I bought a brand new defect product, but I can not accept I bought a used product when it was claimed &#34;brand new&#34;."
Very impressed with this case. It was exactly what I wanted without any of the added bulk other cases seem to have. It went on easy and fits the phone snug. It was exactly what I wanted!
Didn't protect the front. It was ok. Bought s better case. Def not worth $10
Great Product!<br />It holds my phone in place and it does not slip off or anything.<br />Definitely recommend.
perfect for what I needed
"This is an almost indestructible plastic cover, and almost no bubbles.  My copy created a permanent bubble around the rear-facing camera, I think because of the camera indention.  The OEM protector was cut around that camera.<br /><br />The first one arrived badly smashed - this is a ridged piece, not a thin film, and someone sat something heavy on it in-transit.  The second was intact and I like it.  It replaced the wimpy one that came on the phone, and within weeks had scratches on it.<br /><br />Forget those three-packs of thin film, this is the kind of protector that works.  Wonder if they make one for a Nikon...."
"There is always a slight buzzing but they are very comfortable to wear, I got them to listen to before I go to sleep so it isn't a huge deal."
Works perfect in my iPhone playing music thru my Aux in 2010 ToyotaTacoma.
Great radio for the price. Awesome when it's paired with an apple device. Has a few small quirks but I can only imagine an upcoming update would take care of it. Tons of settings and user friendly.
"These ear buds work as expected and the battery life is great, however the cords that attach the ear buds to the unit are too short even with the o-rings that secure them rolled back as far as they will go.  They are not so short that I cannot use the headseat, but they are short enough that I sometimes notice an annoying tug."
"It's a good looking case, but the clear window becomes scratched so easily that the case looks old before it's time. The good news is that it works with the charging pads better than my other case.<br /><br />The buttons are smooth on the sides and do not provide any tactile feedback. With gloves on, you cannot tell if you have pressed a button or not. So many times you will turn the screen on and off a couple times in a row. It's a decent case for a decent price."
"This case help if you just drop your phone, it does not protect prom the water at all, but on the box it says that this case can protect your phone under water around 6 feet deep for a 1 hour. This case is just waist of money. And yeah, they doesn't replace my phone, they just send me a new case. Why do I need a new case if my phone is not working?"
I love this charger! I've been using it for over a month now and it's still intact and working well. I needed a long cable and this is what I've been looking for.
Love this case. It is made well. I've had it on my iPhone 5C for a long time. I have dropped it several times and it is protected and not broken yet.
"I love my Mvp pro 3.0 is a very good battery. There is some this to observe:  1 - I've bought this battery as a kit on Amazon 2 times from other seller and never came with the sub g tank so I bought again from this seller on the option with no tank and retuned the previous items.  2 - it's perfect for most of the tanks but you can read on the manual that will not do coils under 0.4 ohm. So pay attention on that!  3 - it's very easy to use, press the button 3 times to turn it on.  4 - always read the manuals online before to buy it or use it, follow the manual from your coils online to see how much voltage they can handle.  5 - never charge this device on the car or with cheap cables, it's not going to charge cause have protection against bad quality charges."
Husband loves it -  Has it on his golf cart.
Great for on the go. Its a bit smaller then my S6 works great and charges my phone fast..I have done the charging of two phones at once and did not have to charge them both together.
"Arrived very quickly.  Was exactly what I expected.  Works well.  The only thing is you need to push a button to move the leg to the desired position which is fine, but if you do not push the button you could break.  After knowing this it is very easy to set to desired angle."
stylus  doesn't fit in note 4 opening
"Reviewing cables is silly. This does exactly what you'd expect. It is a good build quality, not flimsy."
This phone worked for 1 week fine and after that started to reboot itself and to not recognize the sim card. DO NOT BUY IT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!
"Does it work? yes. Is it spotty? not the biggest deal, BUT, it makes a horrific high pitched noise when plugged in.If you have good hearing I wouldn't buy unless you want headaches, if your hearing is spotty, go for gold."
The original broke after about a month. I emailed Anker and they sent out a brand new one no questions asked within two days of our conversation. This is why i love Anker and always stick with them!
"Absolutely adore this case. Cute color, easy storage. Wish the front part of the case was white or same color blue though."
low quality earbuds! They do not stay in the ear! cheaply made!
love this.  life changing item.  really cool and pretty sturdy.  A+
I bought this case for my phone. I absolutely love it. I've had it about 6 myhs now and all the lil bling diamonds are all still in tact!!  💜
"This fits over the Galaxy S6 Edge perfectly, without the added frustration of trying to stuff in an inner rubber bumper. Dropped it several feet while bike riding, and the case has a small dirty dent; but the phone is still in perfect condition. I haven't had the time to make my own backings, but the benefit of being able to change it whenever I want is awesome. While not a game changer; I just wish the website had a digital template to work off of instead of a flimsy paper stencil."
"A great phone considering the price! Battery life is somewhat limited, but overall performance is excellent. The upgrade to Lollipop sent flawlessly and the phone has no other real issues."
"I really like these headsets, the fit well, and sound really good, the problem is that both pairs I ordered had the same problem, after a bout two weeks of use, they stopped taking a charge resulting in about five minutes of use when powering them on. Too bad."
"So far i love this case.  Not bulky, protects phone from my clumsiness, and the case fits the phone perfectly.  It's not flashy.  Just right for me.  Delivery of the product was prompt.  No issues.  Quality good."
"This case has done it's job, as I have dropped my phone multiple times and no harm has been done. The only thing I don't care for is how dirty the part around the edge (mint green part) looks. I've tried cleaning it with cleaning products and it appears to be permanently stained."
love how loud it is even with out amp... hooked to cb and scared the hell out of everyone i yelled at .... small so its easy to put anywhere on truck..... id buy more if needed
It was highly advertised that it doesn't give you any annoying error messages and guess what it does.  The length of the cords are great.
"Poor quality, would like a refund or a new one sent to me, till the nexus 5 2015 is available"
"Can't go wrong with an OEM charger.  In this case, I purchased it as a spare charger for my new Samsung S5"
"Battery and charger are great. There is no issues with it. I like how fast the charger is. It is well worth the money and the battery is oem. Overall,  great value."
Bought this part for my friend who has an issue with his camera. He was able to fix it and works better than his original camera.
"Cool cover. I really like how it fits the phone. You take the original back case off of the phone and then this one snaps on.  Only problem is that I am worrked it may break along the seam. Other than that, it is good."
Came extremely quick! I love this case!! Buy this!!
"True to color. And the best part is its made out of a good material. It's very durable. I always drop my phone, so this case helps me many times so I didn't have to get a new phone."
"Does not fit a 1995 Blazer 2 door. Both the Amazon car checker and Crutchfield showed this was correct. The correct one for a 1995 Blazer 2 door is Metra 72-4500, they fit the door speakers and the rear quarter panel 6 x 9 speakers. I thought maybe they would fit the dash speakers, they do not fit there either. FYI."
the gps103b is not working as an alarm. it is responding to sms request but not  to key fob or any input from sensors.
"I bought my glass screen protector, amd it is really disappointing. I don't do things that are particularly hard on phones, just normal adult use and my first one cracked within weeks. I got a replacement for the $5.99 shipping charge, and within weeks, it is cracked in multiple places again. The phone is never without a case either for protection from falls and such. The only conclusion I can draw is the protector itself is flawed in some way"
I ordered 10 foot cables and these cables are only 9'9&#34;  should not be advertised as 10 foot
"I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library, and this Cottage Cutz two-piece mini frog die looks cute on my favorite anniversary card.  It would also work well on children's birthday cards.<br /><br />I used 80 lb. card stock to cut this die on my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine,<br /><br />Please see customer image for an example of an A7 (5&#34; x 7&#34;) anniversary card that I made with this die.  The castle die is made by Quick Kutz and the cat tails are cut from another Cottage Cutz die, &#34;Mallard Ducks w/ Cats-tail.&#34;"
"If you're in doubt to purchase this, don't be! Order it!  I had my iPhone 6+ mounted on my motorcycle - it happened to pop out of the holder it was in, while I was moving.  I guess it was the vibration.  Irregardless, it landed on concrete in the middle of a busy intersection. After turning around to go retrieve it, I watched it being driven over by 4 cars.  There is not one scratch on my phone.  The screen did not break/crack.  I was so relieved when I got it back - words cannot describe."
"Was just what my husband needed, he just broke the screen on his phone so this is a life saver."
Love this! I Have been using this holder for my IPhone 6 while riding my bike for the past 2 months or so. I ride on paved streets and crushed gravel bike paths and it works great..my phone stays in place solidly and is easy to use. I definitely recommend this product!
"These headphones really deliver! Being on the go all the time, having a durable, lightweight, and wireless headset was very high on my priority list. After doing some research, and reading the many positive reviews, I decided to try these Blimark Bluetooth earbuds, and I was very happy with my decision!<br /><br />After receiving them promptly, I was immediately impressed by the overall quality of the packaging and materials, and the sound was extremely impressive as well. Even though the bass is a bit subtle and perhaps not as deep as some over the ear or higher quality headsets, these earbuds still create the perfect undertones to those hot and heavy dance beats!<br /><br />They are excellent at noise cancellation as well, allowing the music to be super focused with the perfect level of sound. The comfortable fit allows them to fit snug and very close to your ear, making them great for working out, running, or even dancing. I have been using them for several weeks now, and I can honestly say that I will not be using any other kind for quite some time! If you’re looking to purchase a pair of great wireless headphones without breaking the bank, this is the set to get!"
I like this case. I was looking for a case that was not bulky and i could easily grip. With this case i can get to the phone unlock it with my fingerprint and scroll better. I found that it fits really good in my hand when im using it. the rubber is not thick and all around fits nicely on my phone. One of the good parts of getting this case it came with a  screen protector. Fits goods and didn't take away from the sensitivity. I love the color it is just as pictured.
I am very pleased with my order it was more than I expected and fast delivery!!!
The charger holds its grip to the watch and does its job so far. The problem is that it is indeed a charger only. If you want to connect it to the computer via USB it doesn't work at all. I suppose that it provides only power connections and the data pins are not connected at all. The computer doesn't recognize it when plugged in although the watch is charged properly. If you are an Android Wear developer and need this to connect to the computer then this is definitely not your cradle.
Quality and performance is tip top. Keep striving for better Anker!
"is only for 5 months,I brought in march and not work."
"My mom made me purchase this for my hike on the Appalachian Trail. It worked great the first two weeks until I changed the batteries. After that, it quit sending the automatic updates to the website. It would turn off until manually turned back on. Needless to say my family and friends thought I was dead quite a few times.<br /><br />I'm sure it's all my fault and I bought the wrong batteries or something but was still a big pain in the butt. I haven't messed with it since returning."
"I bought one. It worked. I bought a second one for another vehicle. It didn't work, so I switched the two. I used the second one and it caught on fire. I burned my hand. Luckily, me and my kids are okay, and so is the. Vehicle and $900 phone. The original one fell apart the same day as the fire. Don't waste your money!!!"
I love this case for my new 5c.  It fits the phone perfectly and is snuggly.  I also love the color and how it is also transparent so that you can see the green of my phone on the back.  This is not a bulky case and fits nicely in purses that have pre-sized pouches for cell phones. I highly recommend this case.
"The Worst !  Range and clarity sucks. this my second one , no better then the first"
Haven't had the back up camera part installed yet but it works great as a mirror
"This has been fantanstic.  It quick charges my phone (an i6) which has been REALLY useful when out for a long day.<br /><br />Down sides:  Takes a long time to charge, and is a little heavy to carry around -- but I usually leave one in the car.<br /><br />For the great price, I bought 2, so the long charge time doesn't cause a problem.  When one is charged, I put it in my car and plug in the second."
The battery lasted 8 days.  After the 8th day started getting the message &#34;Invalid Battery&#34;
"Very good<br />Only problem is plastic screen scratches kind of<br />easily, but not a big deal.  Dropped phone several times with no damage.  Nice looking case."
I followed instructions on the internet (it took me two hours) and the battery broke the iphone.  I had to buy a new phone because of it:(
"I have an Iphone 6 Plus, and when I put my phone in it it snapped back and actually cracked my Zag glass screen protector, I hope my actual phone is not cracked, I have not taken my screen protector off yet! The stick itself works great, but this now might cost me a couple hundred dollars."
"6 months,no problems yet; except foe the fact that it doesnt read mini sd cards, being thats the reason i bought it"
Goes on very easily and stays in place. So far it saved my screen from a really nasty damage so i can safely say that this product can withstand cosmetic stuff due to regular wear.
"As others have indicated, the black jelly case is very glossy. It doesn't look like the picture and scuffs easily. Buttons take some effort to push, and I frequently have to hold both sides to squeeze the power button (sometimes accidentally taking screen shots!). But it does make the phone much more tacky and easy to hold. It fits well and ports are easily accessible."
Very pleased with this arm band. Does what I need it to and fits perfectly. I would recommend the arm band extender for those with average to larger sized arms.
Good thing it has 2 ports. There's always someone else in my car. Its good material. Charges my phone perfectly fine. No complaints. I recommend this product.
They are pretty legit. Charge just fine. I don't know why but i thought they were metal. heh.
"One tool was slightly bent, the battery was OK at best as far as performance."
This is what it says..... waterproof but NOTE:....IT DOES NOT FLOAT.  If you are looking for a floating case you need to look further.  I was not thinking about that and guess I assumed that it would float.  I cannot hold that against the product as it does not make any claims as such.  It is what it says and the price it right. Good product.
Pouch works exactly as described. Very satisfied with purchase!
"[[ASIN:B00QTE09SY iClever® 4.8A 24W Dual USB Travel Wall Charger with SmartID Technology, Foldable Plug for iPhone iPad, Samsung Galaxy, HTC Nexus Moto Blackberry, Bluetooth Speaker Headset, Power Bank and More, White]]  Great product that solves a simple problem and ends the race between my wife and I for the charger outlet.  No worry that we have different devices and this thing knows what you need and handles the job.  Quality seems excellent."
"It works pretty good for the price, the button is a little sensitive when changing settings,other than that very happy with purchase<br />i"
"This thing is awesome! Its small and quickly charges my phone and tablet. I bought it when it went on sale for 10$, which is a great price to pay for this product. This product doesn't come with a wall charger but it comes with a USB to micro USB. Since I had an old wall charger from a phone, I was able to use that. If you have a Samsung Galaxy, the USB charging cord that comes with it can be used to charge your phone. The cord that comes with it is not super long, which I like while charging my phone because it doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />Pros: Small, charges quickly, holds good charge easy to use, indication of external battery charge with LED<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes if its charging something for a while it gets hot, doesn't come with a wall charger (wasn't a big deal to me)"
"Like the case. It's comfortable in the hand, the buttons work well, and most importantly the phone feels protected. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing case... Wish UAG wasn't stamped so prominently on the back"
"I love, love love this cell phone clutch.  I have 3 different ones and this one is by far the prettiest.  Good quality.  Well worth it."
It chipped after 30 days of use when my daughter dropped it but the phone is still good.
[[ASIN:B00DZSGS8W BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (White/blue)]] this gatge this device vin with deserts programming details which do not allow me to save messages or contacts or because at times restarts alone and makes me lose the information stored with the understanding that they sent a malfunctioning phone.
"Awesome phone case, doesn't make the phone look big, the design is great and the buttons are great to the touch."
"Love it. Easy to apply and i didn't face any problems with it. I loved the it came with it tow small wipes to clean your screen before apply it, one is dry and one is wit."
"I ordered this case as a gift for my niece and she loves it, she said it made her phone look very classy and the stylus was an extra bonus that she enjoys.  However, I also ordered the glass screen protector which did not fit the phone, so I will be returning it."
"The case met my expectations. The corners are more of a soft rubber with a hard back. It is two pieces, easy to put on. It does add a little bulk to an already good sized phone, but I like it, I feel like my investment is protected. It arrived fast, good service."
"Sound great.<br />Bluetooth connection can sometimes be problematic.<br />Charging connector is terrible, so whether or not it will charge when you plug it in is a roll of the dice.<br />Without power, these are pretty much worthless."
The glass was not a perfect fit but it has protected my phone nicely. I would suggest watching videos on how to install.
"I bought them in April and they just stop functioning the other day (August).  If that had not happened I would have given it 4-5 stars.  The only other reason not 5 stars was, the &#34;on&#34; switch did not connect the device reliably.  I had to repeatedly switch it &#34;off&#34; & &#34;on&#34; about 4 times, every time, to get it to connect.  I love the headphones, but I guess they don't work, so no good."
"Solid product. I have a few different Anker cables, and none have let me down so far. The smaller form factor allowed this to work with my wifes Defender case which was a challenge for many cables."
"The absolute first time the phone was dropped while using this case, the screen cracked. I would not recommend this case to someone. The phone fell maybe 3 feet onto the floor, it fell flat, screenside down, and the whole screen cracked. The case also feels very cheeply made, the rubber that covers where the s pen is and the charging port is very flimsy and it feels as if you could easily rip it off. This case does not offer appropriate protection."
I was very schocked when I received this and in a good way . the product looked new and I purchased it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it .
The only reason I gave it an extra star instead of 1 star is because of the price. You get what you pay for. The sound quality is the worst I have ever herd on a pair of head phones. They wouldn't stay in my ears and there was no different sized buds that came with them. I mainly was just buying these with low expectations. I wanted to try a cheap pair of blue tooth buds before I went and spent money on a better pair. So I tried these and I liked the idea and how it worked but these were just too low quality for me. So i have recently spend more money on a higher quality pair and i love them. Maybe ill give these to someone who are curious also before they go spending money on an expensive pair.
This is simply the best selfie stick that I have ever had. All the other previous three failed my expectation. This one has exceeded my expectation with handy design and reliable blue tooth connections.
It's very thin.. not a life proof case by any means. but I love the gold pineapples. I get a lot of compliments on it.
"I just bought a new battery for my Samsung S5 and then the old battery just died on me.. So, now that was no longer my back up, but my full time battery. I noticed my phone dying half way through the day, and didn't think I would stay with Samsung. (I don't like that you can't change out the battery anymore, or add SD card) So I didn't want to buy something only compatible with Samsung. So I purchased this so I can use it with any of my electronics in need of a charge. It works great, and is pretty fast."
It won't stay charged for more than 4 hours even if I'm not texting or talking on it.  Every day by noon it is dead
"Its a fantastic gadget for the car. It is very easy to install and operate. The quality of the product is good. The markings in green, yellow and red while reversing really helps. It does not show the distance though but you will get used to it and develop judgement. The camera  is not freely rotating and needs to be set and fixed tight with the screws provided. Once you connect the power supply from the reverse tail light the camera and monitor (needs to be connected to 12V socket- cigarette lighter) switches on immediately very negligible delay. Overall a value for money gadget."
"[[VIDEOID:f2ef858c1586762c334e2029ea27bda3]]I really like this camera an I'm glad I purchased it. With it I can easily record my trips without having to worry about fiddling with buttons. It's probably smaller than you think and isn't easy to spot as long as you don't put it in the middle of the windshield.  It comes with everything you need to put it in your car, including an 8gb micro sd card, a cig lighter adapter, sticky cable holders and two sided tape to stick it to the windshield. Tip: Make sure you choose a location and test it before affixing it to the windshield. There are extras of two sided tape included, but it's a pain to get back off the windshield once it is on there.  The mount is good, but it could be better. It's easy enough to take the camera off of the mount, but if you wanted to put the camera in a different car you'd have to take the two sided tape off of your windshield and the mount and put on a new piece. That's fine though, since I don't plan on using it in another car.  The camera comes with the latest version of the software as of this writing. The manual directs you to mini0806.com, which has one newer update available (5/2015), but when asking SplashETech about this, they said this is the manufacturer site and that updates would be posted to the splashetech.net site, which apparently is no longer their site since the last time I visited it. I have no idea what happened with that, but it looks like the current site is advertising furniture.  The video looks good. I was only able to clearly make out license plates on the highest setting though. The GPS is a nice feature. You can set it to display the speed and coordinates on the video itself along with the date and time. When the sun is at the right angle there is a bit of glare off of the dashboard that is apparently solved with a CPL filter. I see that this is included with some other units. I kind of wish it was included with this instead of the 8gb card, since I probably will not beusing the 8gb card.  At night you can see things, but it's certainly not &#34;night vision&#34; in any sense.  One problem I found is the slot a and slot b functionality doesn't work as intended. From what I gather it's supposed to roll over to the next slot when one card is full. It does not do this though. It'll just remove the oldest files on one card when it is full. If one card is removed, it'll record to the other card. For my purposes a 32gb card is enough for 4.5 hours of video on the second largest video setting, and I really don't need to save more video than that.  Another issue is the manual mentions a &#34;parking guard mount&#34; but it simply isn't available, so there is no true parking mode. You could hard wire into an unswitched power source and just leave the camera on all the time, but that's not really an efficient solution. The option in the menu is supposed to activate recording when a vibration is felt by the camera, but it doesn't look like it works without the mount.  Overall it's a great unit and I would recommend this to a friend. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  To recap -  Pros:  - Very small, and sleek  - Good video quality on the highest setting  - Firmware seems to be updated regularly (at least on mini0806.com)  - Comes with everything you need  Cons:  - The mount could be better  - Slot A & B functionality doesn't work properly (doesn't start recording to other card when one is full)  - Needs the CPL filter to prevent glare  - No parking mode  Edit: added video of a close call I had. The quality is significantly reduced by Amazon. In the full resolution video I can see the car's license plate."
Went kayaking down river and case worked perfectly. I have iphone 6 plus and it fits perfectly. I did the water test before I put my phone in it. Did not take any pictures underwater but it did it did get in water with it around my neck and no problems with water coming in. Very good for me!
"The Defender Case is a typical OtterBox case that is heavy-duty and durable.  This product is thick and clunky.  I think of it more for a construction worker or similar field.  I like that it has a built in screen protector that does not have to be purchased separately.  The name fits the case.  This case also comes with a durable clip to use on the outside of your clothing or clipped into a bag.  The only real “negative” is the price. . . when it’s Made in China for a few bucks. . . it’s hard to justify the current price.  On the other hand, if you want a case with this kind of protection, it’s a great case."
Absolutely love this case. The finish on the back is nice a smooth but the edges give it good grip. I love that the design is not on the outer layer on the back so it does not scratch off. Low profile but sticks out enough to protect the screen and wraps completely around bottom rather than leaving it exposed as others do.
It doesn't last more than 2 weeks. The exact time that i can't return it.  This is my fifth and last.
Since I had to return the phone it didn't work now I have a screen protector that I can't use.. I have to pay the postage to get all my money back..hassle..
I had used this once. I plugged it in to use it a second time and i immediately smelled burning and saw smoke. The end that plugs into the phone was smoking and burning. Smoke immediately filled my car. Had I not been in my driveway this could have been very dangerous. And I've now tried the charger base with other cords and it wont work with any other cord. Needless to say I would never buy another one!!!!
"I use this most everyday on my bicycle.  I get to rock to my iTunes, check weather, or use it for turn-by-turn navigation through the streets of downtown Portland Oregon."
The cap fitted perfect. The unique difference is that the original was wite and this one is black; it doesn't affect anything under the hood.
The cord still works but I can see it cracks on the cord from where the cord would finally give up and stop working. I expected amazon to make better products. I have had this for a little more than 4 months.<br />Amazon Please let me know if I can return or get a replacement. Thanks.
I had no problems putting the screen protector on my phone.  I like the durability of the tempered glass.
"If you have no use for the dual point connectivity, DEFINITELY go with the cheaper model of the same brand! (Kinivo BTC450).<br /><br />The multipoint connectivity of this 455 model allows you to connect two Bluetooth devices concurrently. But it comes with some pretty major trade-offs. For one, for the first 30 seconds after turning on your car and playing music (through your phone for instance) the Kinivo is actively searching for a second device... and for those 30 seconds it fades in and out of your signal. So incredibly annoying!<br /><br />The second side effect is that it gets super confusing when a second device is synced simultaneously anyways. It's gotten so frustrating with my wife in the car with her iPhone paired as well. We have no idea what the Bluetooth is doing, cause sometimes my phone works, and other times hers does. Random. I reset the Kinivo and now I am the only paired device.<br /><br />I do like having a Bluetooth-enabled vehicle now, and everything else about the Kinivo I'm a fan of.<br /><br />One last thing is that if you encounter interference using this you may need what's called a Ground Loop Isolator. I purchased this one (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001EAQTRI) and all my interference went away."
Nice phone.  It does all I need.
Has too many air bubbles.  Unable to get a clear screen.
"WHAT A PIECE OF CHEAPJUNK!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL FUNCTION FOR LONGER THAN 6 WEEKS!<br />THE MICRO USB CONNECTOR ON THE POWERBOT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CHEAPEST OF IT'S TYPE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE OWNED A VARIETY OF DEVICES WITH MIRCO USB PORTS!!!  IT STARTED AFTER ABOUT 5 WEEKS OF USAGE. AT FIRST, THE PORT JUST NEEDED A LITTLE BIT OF JIGGLING TO GET IT TO WORK. AS TIME PROGRESSED, ABOUT 3 WEEKS, THE CHARGING PORT CONNECTION JUST STOPPED FUNCTIONING. NOTE: SINCE I OWN A SAMSUNG GALAXY S3, WHICH IS RENOWNED FOR IT'S HIGH MICRO USB CHARGING PORT FAILURE, AND THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS POWERBOT IN THE FIRST PLACE, I KNEW THAT THE BEST METHOD FOR PREVENTING MICRO USB WEAR WAS TO LEAVE THE MICRO END OF THE CABLE PLUGGED IN TO THE POWERBOT, AND UNPLUG THE STANDARD USB CONNECTOR FROM THE CHARGER WHEN NOT IN USE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DID NOT WORK!  EVEN WITH MY EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS MICRO USB PORT FAILURES, I WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN EVADING THIS ISSUE.  PLEASE CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND THAT HAS A HARDWIRED CABLE AND SKIP ONES WITH A MICRO USB PORT. I ORDERED ONE THE OTHER DAY. IT HAS A STANDARD SIZE USB CABLE COMING OUT OF THE CHARGING UNIT. SO, I WILL LEAVE THAT PLUGGED INTO THE CHARGER AND JUST UNPLUG THE 110 VOLT CHARGER FROM OUTLET. (THIS METHOD ALSO WORKS WITH 12 v CAR CHARGERS) THIS WAY, I WON'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT EXCESSIVE WEAR, AS WELL, ON THE STANDARD USB CONNECTOR."
"Best car charger I have ever used! One of the only chargers I've actually had charge my devices consisistantly. I use a lot of phablet style phones such as the Galaxy Note Series and the One Plus One so these are some power hungry phones, other car chargers just cause these devices to discharge slower or keep a charge while this charger actually provides a real charge to my devices."
This phone mount is clean and looks like it belongs in the car. Not some ugly piece of plastic that serve no purpose. My only complaint is the suction cup. The mount tends to fall from the windshield often. This is can be frustrating when you're using your GPS
"This would be probably my fourth Anker product and there is a reason for it. The charger is at par with latest smartphone chargers. I own a OnePlus One and did a charge test. There is absolutely no noticeable difference between as far as charge time is concerned. Tested the ampere rating with app as well, they both perform quite similar. Bought it off a sale day at $8 bucks.  Pros: - Super quick charging i.e. Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 with 2A output - 3ft long powerful cable included which is ideal for most uses - Sub $10 price point"
"These come pre-impreganated with dust. Once installed, the cover shimmers rainbow colors. I opted to leave my screen unprotected rather than use these. If these were condoms, then I'd have dozens of children by now."
Protects your screen from scratches while giving it that smooth glass feeling. I'll never go back to plastic screen protectors.
"Charges 2 5s's at the same time easily. Nice and low profile, was a lot smaller than most others I saw in the store."
"I am amazed. This cord is perfect. First, the length. I am able to use my device in bed, use it on the couch in any comfortable position, and best of all charge my device without any faulty wiring.   The cord (10 ft) I bought is beautiful. It is nearly identical to the shipped 30-pin cords that come with iDevices. The connection from the charging end to the port on my device is firm and fixated yet not so much that its a struggle to unplug. Storage is nice because the cord coils up into a nice circle, making a comfortable width of about a soda can.  The best part of this buy is that the price was around ten dollars (including shipping). TEN DOLLARS. The quality of this accessory is so akin to the stock cords that I can hardly believe it. I will absolutely be buying more.  UPDATE: It's been about one month. The cord has ceased to charge my device. I had to buy yet another 30-pin cord. I'm asking for a refund."
Nice value. Protects the screen well. Delivered quickly.
"The case I purchased was the &#34;Hakuna Matata&#34; saying one. I also have the same problem with the charging area not being able to fit the plug. Overall the skin is pretty durable protection (not if you drop it of course). But protects from scratches. It does leave the bottom open for dust and dirt to get into the speaker holes, so clean often."
I got promo code for leaving fair review. great deal!
"These are good quality; I like the Bluetooth capability. I like how they can be used wirh music and phone calls.  Sometimes, though, they do fall out of my ears. That causes an inconvenience. I would recommend these for use."
I had this for only a month and the charging port just broke off inside my phone when i was taking my phone out of it. It has to be a defective device and now I can't return it. I expected this device to last longer.
"It came with the cover snapped off, but after I put it back together and plugged it in I loved it. It seemed to charge my phone quicker then my old one, and I love that I can charge my phone in one and my daughter's phone in the other. The red light lets you know without wondering that your phone or device is charging. I have charged not only my phone but my laptop as well as my tablet. It seems substantial and strong enough to stand up to my teenagers and all the electronics that &#34;must&#34; be charged while driving. I am glad I was able to have the chance to purchase this through the VIP review club, and would definitely buy again."
"The case is so beautiful,  it is stunning! It fits my Galaxy Note 4  very snug, perfect cutouts for all ports, absolutely gorgeous. I have a white Galaxy Note 4, so the case  looks exactly like in the picture....actually better. I think the picture does not do it justice. My phone looks better and more stylish with clear case and a little touch of fuschia. My girlfriend is so in love with this case, she wants one, too...I might order one as a gift for her, also clear and fuschia ( dark pink)  Update: I ordered another case for my friend and she is very happy with it. We both love our clear cases with just a hint of pink."
"I Bought the previous version of this product but don't see a difference between the two. Works great with Cricket, but there is a caution.<br /><br />It includes a nanoSIM, with adapters for microSIM and miniSIM. I didn't know the difference, but the phone I got had an icon on the box that said not to use adapters. I googled and found out that the problem isn't electrical, it is mechanical in that the contacts that connect to the SIM card can catch on the plastic seams of the adapter if the SIM is removed and bend or break.<br /><br />This problem isn't a concern for me since I have no intention of ever removing the SIM, but it could become an issue if I change carriers (or Cricket requires a SIM change for some reason).<br /><br />So, depending on your phone, and if you ever want to remove the SIM, this may be a problem. You can google how to remove a nanoSIM in an adapter safely, which essentially is to use a thin plastic sheet (like screen protector film) to slip in between the SIM and contacts before removing the adapter in order to protect the contacts. There are YouTube videos showing the method (example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv8fA8j_8oQ)."
"Nice watch, but apps are not that robust.  Good watch and great to see texts and calls on my wrist before pulling my phone out of my pocket, but most other apps I have tried and then removed from the watch.  A few gave errors and developers did not resolve."
"I love the design of this case, but that's about it. For one thing, it won't even stay on my phone, it keeps randomly popping out of place and it won't actually protect your phone at all, lots of the edges are still exposed."
"I'm pleased with this phone case. I was using a Pelican case that I bought at ATT when I got my phone. This one feels high quality. It does not have a rubber or silicone band or outer casing, which gives it a sleeker design. It also feels lighter than my other case, but I don't think we sacrificed protection. I have dropped my phone with this case on, without issues.I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because the case makes the buttons a little hard to push. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for a review, but the words are my own."
"I've reviewing quite a few usb charging systems over the year and as far as pure speed this one topped them all. Since I have no quick charge 2.0 compatible devices I tested it on my OnePlus One smartphone and noticed an overall 10% increase of charge speeds over my usual high speed charger, and over 100% faster than a normal usb charger.<br /><br />Quick stats:<br />Turbo Charger from Iclever: 2000 mah<br />My speedy hootoo usb faster charger: 1900 mah<br />Normal usb charger: 1000 mah<br /><br />This is a personally recommended item."
"Good, with a major flaw - The watch tends to become disconnected from the dock regularly because the magnet is recessed into the stand. I've woken up a few times and had to charge it differently."
"I am well satisfied with the Mophie 2200.  Is it real or a knockoff?  It sure looks real to me.  The packaging, product, and instructions are first rate.  It was at half charge out of the box.  It seems to loose a little charge during the day.  You absolutely MUST use the provided cable.  The one that came with the phone is to light weight.  It has too much loss.  It will work even better with a higher amperage charger like the one from a tablet. The fully charged Mophie will only recharge my S3 to about 60% ( wonder if it might be old/new stock?).  Which is okay for my needs.  It fits my phone perfectly!  No removing the back of the phone or anything like that.  I added a screen protector to protect the screen.  Both seem to protect the phone somewhat.  I don't think it comes anywhere close to the protection that I gave up using the Otter Box Defender (which leaks dust and dirt like a screen door and lasts less than a year before the rubber deteriorates).  The LEDs, switches, and case cutouts perform perfectly.  The buttons are somewhat sensitive, like on the phone itself.  Takes some getting used to after having to mash the buttons on the Otter Box.  It solved two of my needs. 1. No need to carry a spare battery in my pocket.  2. Saves the wear and tear on my phone recharging jack which can be somewhat fragile.  I am totally happy with this purchase, especially at the price of less than $20.  Now if could only find the drop in charger for it.  How cool would that be?"
Love the sound and noise cancellation<br />I feel surrounded by the music without outside distractions. They are comfortableto wear for extended period of time and the folding portability is great.
These are my favorite earbuds. The sound quality is good. The earbuds fit nice and snugly and stay in place. They are even comfortable to wear while laying on my side in bed. The remote & mic make pause/play and answering calls very easy.
was great  doing the job  very happy
"I was skeptical at first, trusting my phone to these bags, but I'll be damned, it worked perfectly. So long as you set up a hardware button on your phone for snapping pictures, you can take underwater photos and videos all day long.<br /><br />Remember a few things if going in the ocean:<br />1. Open your camera/video app before entering the water (Capacitive screens do not work underwater)<br />2. Assign a hardware button to snap a picture/start recording<br />3. Put your phone in Airplane mode. You won't get any signal underwater anyway."
I really love this case it is made out of what looks like real wood but the only bummer is that it does crack easily the first time i dropped my phone it cracked which is really a bummer i only had it for 3 days!! I do have to say it is very protective because i dropped it down my stairs and i really thought it would crack but it didn't!!
"It gets the job done, as described, great buy for a solid brand name detector, very basic, but hook up and go."
This should be rated zero stars. Worst electronics purchase I have made in years. This thing is absolutely terrible. I travel a lot for work in the car and in and out of noisy airports each week. The sound suppression not only suppressed background noise but my voice cut in and out. Tried different placements of the mic and found if I smashed it against my face you could understand me on the other end. To hear anyone when driving or in a noisy environment I had to smash the earpiece into my ear and hold it with my hand. Not at all practical or comfortable. I either received a very defective product or the fact this thing is on the market is damn near criminal. I threw it out the window while driving it was so frustrating to try and rely on as a business person trying to conduct business in our mobile world. Epic failure of a product.
💜💜💜this case is awesom ! I dropped my case at least 4 times and I had no damage to my phone!
"Cable does everything as intended. Only issue for me is the &#34;TA&#34; logo brushed off within a day of usage, so if you like the Tech Armor logo, I'm sorry."
Really cute. Not much protection to the phone but really pretty.
"Delivery was fast, and devise works well, as described."
"Pretty good screen protector, has a tendency to smudge more often and leave more fingerprints than the actual screen does, but other than that, great product, especially for the price"
"This is a complete waste. I am the worst of the purchase list. The worst finish of the goods, quality is also not good.  you can see circle of the screen and bond between screen."
"I was very impressed with the quality, fit and finish of a brand I've never heard of.  Verus makes a nice case!  Everything lines up and fits tight as it should.  All materials are top quality. The case does not add much bulk to the Note 5.<br /><br />The case was easy to install on my Note 5.  I disagree that the case is hard to take off.  I found it very easy to remove by pushing through with my thumb on the back TPU section while pulling back on the front section with my other index fingers, at the corner where the S-pen is located.<br /><br />I think the case would do a good job at protecting my Note 5 if it fell on it's back, sides, but not the front or on a front angle drop.  The case just doesn't have enough material there. A slightly thicker front TPU lip is needed to increase protection.  Some texture on the sides of the molded poly-carb would help to hold the phone  better.<br /><br />The hair line finish on the back looks very good in person.  Finally, I would recommend this case to anyone looking for moderate protection for their Note 5."
"Surprising great case, I've been using this for 6 months already and have dropped my phone few times, great protection and fits nice too. I just bought another one for my sister's phone!"
"I bought this product , its oky but I could not plug in to my Toyota corolla, anybody knows if it works for Toyota corolla car?"
"Have tried several other trackers, and this is my favorite. I have to make myself exercise, so I want full credit for every step."
"They are basic, but work great. The quality of it is better than expected so far. And the magnet on it works so great, It's like it is held by a button. So far very happy with it."
This one isn't quite strong enough.  My son-in-law found a better one.  But this works.
I have been wanting a longer iPhone cord and this one works! I have been using it for a few months and it still works fine. Love the added length so it will now reach from the plug to the table.
"love the see thru slot for id, love the feel of the case, getting lot of comments, love the closing tab and the phone case holder in the case."
"Works as a replacement iPhone 5S home button.  Remember, there will be no itouch after you replace the button.  The process to replace the buttom is fairly straight forward and easy.  Just check out all the youtube videos.  This came safety packaged"
this is amazing quality and it came fast!
Has already cracked after 1st fall. I just need the cover now but have to order the whole set all over again. Price is ok but poor quality.
Love my wallet case. I ordered a second one shortly after purchasing my first because once the first falls apart (as all wallets and/or cases do) over time...I wanted a backup on hand! Would easily order more if needed!
"These inexpensive cables work fine and feel like good quality.  The packaging is a step up from a blister pack or cheap box, and has some nice notes and thank yous for purchasing the product.  Just opening the box gave me a feeling of quality."
"this battery works well as the one I had, which is as much as I could have expected. I was just hoping it would last longer than the year old one I had been using. I'll have to spend aliitle more next time."
Bought for my stepdad. He loves it. Fits great. Great protection.
With all the research about blue leds messing up circadian rythims you'd figure more manufactures would take the hint and use green instead of blue..  Anyway blue led aside the cable worked for about 6 months of daily use then the connector wore out.  It was nice to have the lit end to find in the dark though.
"Lovin it thus far. I got this to keep in my pocket along with a small portable power pack and love them both. Before I would run out of juice before making it to my car but now I'm good. Because it's in my pocket all the time I wonder how long it will last before the little cable is wore out but if I get 6 months out of it I will be happy. If I don't, I'll be sure to revisit this review."
I purchased this because I wanted a wall charger for some 26650 batteries.  It is unreasonably difficult to insert batteries of size 26650 into the charger.  plus they don't appear to seat correctly.  I returned this for this reason as well as the fact that it arrived damaged.  Smaller batteries will most likely fit much better.
The case is very good.<br />However it is clunky and makes the phone much heavier.
Charger works fine. But I had searched for &#34;iphone 6 car charger&#34; and this popped up so I never even thought to confirm it was actually for an iPhone 6 since I'd specifically typed that. Used the car base and bought a new cord. Not sure if Amazon or seller/Belkin was misleading but a pain either way. But the car charger base works just fine.
"Excellent protection for the Samsung Galaxy S4.  It is soft, pliable, and easy to install."
"This phone is no good.  The screen goes off and on, and it is not even a year old.  Don't be selling phones to customers that wouldn't even last a year.  Besides, the screen goes blank every time."
"Well, it's been 3 years since my purchase, and this case is still working for me.  No it may not be water-proof, but put the phone ina  plastic bag or thin layer of plastic, put the excess to the back, put this phone case back on and there you go, it's semi-water proof at that point at least.  That got me through rainy work days when I had to work outside.  Either way this case has caused my phone to survive alot, I wore some pants that had awful pocket slots on them and it kept falling out of my pocket while mountain biking on pavement, my phones going on 3 years just fine.  Other than that I have also exercised extreme caution with my phone, I rarely, if ever, drop my phone under any circumstances.  This case has a great grip to it which isn't easily dropped.  I can't really say enough about this, I got mine for $5.00, however I see the price is now at about $9.97,  still a good deal, most definitely."
"Beautiful packaging and wonderful directions that went with it! I usually have bad luck with putting on screen protectors rather crooked or tones of bubbles but with the tools they give you along the clear and easy to follow directions, it was a peace of cake and I don't mean to brag but mine is on there pretty perfect! The clarity is like nothing is on my screen no  cloudiness what so ever also the cover feels like the apple glass so going from no cover to this was seamless!"
Sucks!
Great band.  Comfortable and fits nice.
"Excellent product. Initial purchase had one problem in that USB end broke inexplicably. However, once I contacted support team at Native Union, they were swift in apologising and sending me a new cable in the post ( which is working fine ). Product is really useful in that 3 metre solid fibre cable allows so much more flexibility for usage while using far away plug points. The moveable weight ball is also a simple yet genius idea as it enables the stability of knowing that IPhone won't slide off and fall/smash on the floor. Combined with the excellent customer service at Native Union I would strongly recommend this product. This a company that really values its customers, well done NU!"
camera use
Works exactly as it should and even charges my S6 with a case on.  It'd be 5 stars if it came with it's on plug in USB adapter.
"NICE PRINT OF OLD GLORY,LIKE IT VERY MUCH"
"Selfie stick works great, all you have to do is plug it into your phone & go. The only issue I had was with the packaging. The box was a little smashed and the only instructions for the device was on the back of the box in extremely small print. Luckily it was easy to figure out on my own. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review."
This is the last case you'll ever buy!!! Dog & Bone cases are the real deal and are superior to Lifeproof cases. I say this because a threw my Lifeproof in the garbage and took the chance on the Dog & Bone case. With this case I get the same protection without the muffled sound which is what sold me. Plus the case is far more pleasant to look at. Also their customer service is A++ they responded to my emails within minutes. Overall you can't go wrong with this case or company they are awesome.
"I tried one then went and bought 3 more for my kids' cars. so much better than suction cup devices or gluing something to your dash. Although designed for a phone without a case, they work fine with LifeProof and other cases. Horizontal or vertical and with power cable plugged in. I can now use the iPhone with Waze(r) as my primary GPS, in place of my bulky, outdated Garmin GPS that I can retire.<br /><br />Small, lightweight but does the trick. Seems solid and clever way to hold your phone."
Perfect solution to replacement of battery in Galaxy 3 phone. Price is great and no issues with working right away.
for a fair review they provided me with a discount code. great product
Item not received in Apple box. They were both in a plastic bag. The cable might be own but can't tell for sure since its white. The wall charger adaptor is a knock off because it has no apple logo on it and says happy on it made in China. Not what I was expecting at all.
"Great stand, I would recommend it to anyone who wants the ability to charge their watch and phone at the same time.  I use mine with a 42mm watch and a iPhone 6 plus so size is no issue.  My only wish is better cable management, the watch cable stays put well but the one for the phone has to be tied around the base.  It works but some kind of clip holding the phone cord in place would be nice so it doesn't fall to the floor when not in use."
Product feels like it is good quality. I hope to get a few years out of this. I feel confident about this product.
"Works just as advertised. The operation takes some getting used to but it is a great unit for the price. The play button can be a little unresponsive given that three buttons are in pretty close proximity, so it will take some practice to be able to nail it on the first try."
"Very easy to put on because it's a glass plate and not a plastic film.<br />But it cracks easily. I don't drop my phone that much and when I do it's a small drop with no damage, but the few times I've dropped my phone this screen protector cracks. I'm glad my actual phone screen didn't, but I don't think it would've anyways. I've bought 2 of these now and they have only lasted a couple weeks before cracking from a small drop.<br />Other than cracking easily this is a good screen protector."
"I love this product! It's very lightweight and durable. It also has two pockets for mostly used cards or an ID pocket. What surprised me is the small mirror it came with, great idea..not too bulky! It arrived in a very sturdy package to protect it. I would buy another, to gift for a friend."
"Great case, protects well, not impossible to remove, looks nice. Kickstand is a bit flimsy bug I never really use it anyways."
This is an excellent watch and fitness tracker.  Ordering was easy and arrived on time (even on a Sunday).  I have been very impressed by the watch and would recommend highly.
This makes carrying everything in you want in one place.
"Very good price, works very well. I plugged my I phone 5 direct to the charger. This power adapter which can be used for input AC110-240V and output 5VDC/1A. It charged very fast. Great products. I am very happy with this adapter and will buy it again."
"Bought it for my kids. So far works great , no complains."
"I purchased the iPhone 6 sport armband in green it's a great color just like the pic.  These are stitched well, the neoprene is soft and strong, it's pretty comfortable. I haven't worked out with it but I can tell you it's perfect for playing with your kids at the playground, after you get used to it you forget you're wearing it.  My phone fit even with a slim bumper case on (youvogue); and the touchscreen, while not as sensitive, was still usable through the vinyl face on this and with the tempered glass screen protector.  The little key slot is too small for an automotive chip key but I didn't even notice that it had one in the description so I didn't buy it for that anyway. You could tuck some cash in there.  All in all its a great piece of gear and I will use it a lot.  Love the fun colors!<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Does what I expected it to.  Absolutely essential on a Fitbit Charge.
works perfect
"Perfect for quickly charging all of my Apple devices at once. A must have if you are a family with multiple tablets, phones, etc."
"It adheres easily to the screen , no bubbles . I like it !"
This headset outs terrible. My husband is used to the lg but we got this one for fear of getting a knock off version of his beloved lg set. This had no range and I can barley heart him when he talks. I purchased out awhile back for him. He keeps putting it in the drawer for use if his beloved lg broke again. This week the inevitable did happen and yes he went to using this thing. He hates it and I hate hearing about how much he hates it.  Now if you do not have a superior set you've used previously it may be ok for you. He has to have an easy too hide set so it doesn't show on his uniform at work with good range. He also listens tho music all the time too when He's running and working out. He's on the phone all the time and it has to be something easily hidden and comfortable to use. For some reason it seems tho be just the opposite for him. So anyway this it's my honest review but like I said you may not be as picky as he is.
"Solidly mediocre. Yes, it does the job, but it feels like it will nearly break the cd slots on my and my wife's car. It also feel a bit cheap. If I could do it over, I'd likely pass on this mount."
"Unit Detects as expected for the price, compass does not work correctly. city button continues to stick and can not set while mounted to window.<br />power supply quit working, I opened and found the ground wire had come off, after soldering back it worked. after trying unit , I will most likely not buy another whistler unit."
"The band looks good, but cannot be adjusted small enough for my wrist. I have an average women's size wrist for 5&#34;4&#34; and 125#"
Follow the simple easy instructions and your screen protector will be installed correctly.  I used 2 of the 3 sticky tabs to hold it in place.  The screen protector is not noticeable and it doesn't interfere with the touch screen.  I had NO bubbles to contend with.  It took about 2 minutes to put it on.  Highly recommend!  I also signed up for the awesome lifetime warranty.  I hope I don't need to use ti!
Very difficult to get on. Had one for my 4s and it fit fine. Not sure it is not a knock off. Came in a clear plastic bag!
"This case is solidly built and all, but it is just bulky and the volume buttons are being pressed in it constantly. Also the strap wraps the arm in an awkward way, where there is a space between your arm and the strap in the corners ... I guess it's build for someone with thick arm. It's just OK IMHO."
Awesome product...
"It does work well with my iPhone 5c, however, because of the phone protector I have, the cord that came with it will not fit into my phone.  But I can use the cord that came with the phone and it works fine."
"Excellent product.  I am rarely so pleased with electronic cords, but this one is exceptional."
"Love the battery pack. Anker is absolutely one of the best. It does not come with a charger itself, so you have to use the charged supplied with your phone or tablet. It also didn't come with a cable/adapter to fit the charger I have. Aside from that...no comlaints, just wish it came with these needed accessories."
"The case covers the proximity sensor, so when ending a call, even with the phone away from your face, the screen is blanked.  A bluetooth or wired headphone connection will eliminate that.  But I always don't have one of those with me to use.  I wish I could find a non-rooting way to disable the prox sensor."
Life saver was on a cross country flight 3+ hours and forgot to charge my iPhone before take off.  I was able to plug this in a 5% and it brought it to a full charge and kept it charged until we landed. Holds it internal charge for a good time as well my flight was on a Friday and I charged it the Friday before and was still fully charged.<br /><br />Highly recommend this goes on all my trips with me now. Will be picking up a second one to keep in my backpack for work.
"Fantastic value, great for using your phone as a GPS or watching movies on your lunch break.  The suction cup has had to be restuck once in the four months that I have owned it, and that was during the hot hot heat of the summer."
"This is the best case that I have ever had for my IPhone period.<br /><br />The features I like:<br />* The kick stand is a really cool feature, great for watching you tube videos.<br />* The outer edge is made from a rubber like material, making it non slip.<br />* the clip on cover has a velour material that covers the screen further protecting it from scratches.<br />* Lightweight<br />* low profile, easily fits in my front pocket even with the snap on cover.<br /><br />If you want to protect your phone then you need this case. Just get a third party screen protector and you will be all set.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like is the kickstand is a little hard to deploy when you first get it. As you use it more it gets a little easier to extend."
"Best phone I've ever owned. Not the fastest processor ever, not the best looking screen ever, not the best camera ever, but darn does it get good battery life. I can regularly go 48hrs on a single charge. If I start a day at 100%, even using lots of data and navigating with the GPS, I still have 40%+ by the end of the day. It's great. I'll gladly give up some of the fancy features to not ever be tied down to a phone charger again."
Ordered this product in purple came on time but the color purple was not as the picture it was more raspberry  returned  it!!!
"Excellent product. Holds my HTC phone well in both convertible and SUV. No problems with heat or vibration, phone and mount stays in place."
CAN YOU SAY &#34;BLING&#34;?  These covers are so pretty and affordable you can get several!!
"Looks like all the reviews EXCEPT the low rated ones are from users the received them for free, hell give me a pair for free and I will review them to. I sure ain't gona buy them..."
"Was very upset, I ordered the New Mexico cover and in stead I got the Minnesota cover. Have no other complaints  on any other orders."
"The phone itself is great. The windows operating system is good but doesn't have all the apps you might find on android or apple. Most of the popular apps are there, but my schools app isn't available on it."
I love the look and how easy it was to put on and take off of my phone. I have had this style of case previously. However this one seems SO flimsy that I don't feel like it is protective at all against drops. So I'm using a different one.
not for iphones  it charges it but I need to still attach my I Phone charger  cord
for my neighbor. she said it fits fine. and it a good color.
Works as expected.  I turn car on it turns on and connects to my phone without issue.  Mostly use it for streaming but call quality is very good as well.
"To our surprise, everything what could possibly fall apart, fell apart in less than 3 days. Not happy with this product, we had to throw it away as it was not serving it's purpose and it was not possible to put it together again."
I bought this case straight from Griffin and I love it and the camo color. I have had Griffin Survivor cases since the IPhone 4 and they just keep improving. No more camera flap on this case. The screen protector on this case is awesome too. It doesn't sacrifice typing like the Otterbein where there is a pocket of air in between the case and the protector so you have to press hard. No air pocket in this case. Just buy it yet u won't be disappointed!
"It's a pretty decent stick, the pole could be a bit heavier made, but for under $8, cant beat it."
"On the positive:  light weight, comfortable, loads GPS quickly and accurate, battery life as advertised; easy to add aps; syncs well with iPhone.  On the negative:  the screen is dark, so far unable to control the lap times, cannot toggle to watch mode while also in running mode.  Still learning."
"[[VIDEOID:c06d54005ac3a75238af74d8c87477]]I bought this cell phone case Iphone 6 by Collen for my sister because she needed a case that is not too girly. There were many colors to choose from but decided to get the yellow and black. When it arrived, I was surprised at how now nice the case looks. I bought the yellow and black. There are actually two parts for this case. The yellow part is a very bright color which is made from flexible silicone and the black part is removal which is a stand and is made out of plastic.One thing I like about this product is that there is a glass screen protector included with this case. Instead of buying a separate screen protector this you get everything you need in this product. The stand is pretty sturdy, very useful for when watching a video. I had the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest opinion and I am glad I did."
"Amazing car mount. Plenty of way to get it attached to any phone you have. I have a Note 3 and my girlfriend has a iphone 6, works great with both. Suction cup has a strong hold on windshield or dash (tested it on the dash and needed some force to take it off). Metal plate for magnet holder slipped right under my battery cover without any bulging. Great mount for reasonable price. Very satisfied!!****"
Works great as a mini tripod to take photos with and also for a hand held selfi smartphone supporter. It's easy to mount your smartphone to the tripod and once mounted your phone is held in place no matter how much you move the tripod.
Came with everything except the sticky seal needed to keep the screen in the case (and not dangling out).  I would recommend you find another supplier who included that seal.
"Awesome product. Very nice and sleek. I usually charge 4 devices at once, two iPhones and two iPads, and it does it with ease. Plus, it has a great warranty."
"good product it helps me a lot, when i'm driving just put it on my dash and will charge from the sun."
This screen protector fit perfectly on the LG Utimate 2 and was easy to apply.  It definitely protects the screen and keeps it clean and smear proof.
My first case fidnt get delivered  so they sent a new one right away. It is everything i was looking for. It is good quality and holding up very well.
"I like this skin, the matte covering feels nice, and definitely wards off fingerprints. I was using a plastic shell for this before I ordered this skin.<br /><br />The overall feel is really nice, the material feels different than other stickon skins, way more durable.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this is application. They give you a small spray bottle of water and a little soap or something, I'm not positive what is in the tube. You spray this on the skin, and then apply this to the product. This allows you to approximate placement and slide things into place to make sure it all gets fit properly.<br /><br />This is great for the most part, however I am concerned that there are actually small pockets of this liquid trapped under the skin against my product, that will eventually cause damage. They guarantee a perfect application, but I can't tell if the entire product is adhering to the n3DS, or if there are sill small pockets of water under the skin, even if the skin feels defect free. I removed the skin for the inner faces of my 3ds because of this concern, I saw that water was being held in the indentations for the words START and SELECT, and additionally for the other etchings for the volume and 3d slides on the top face. I attempted to use as little spray as needed, but the adhesive is extremely sticky, and the amount of liquid you need to use causes pooling around the edges of the skin pieces, of which I was worried might damage the speakers or run into the device and get behind the screen.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is about the actual screen protector sections. This could have been done FAR better. See this product: [[ASIN:B00RZ7T8TK HORI Screen Protective Filter for Nintendo NEW 3DS XL]] This product has a very well done application using pull tabs and no water. I had to remove the lower screen protector twice because it shifted and then stuck hard to the screen, and had to pick up a corner with a fingernail to get it to center.<br /><br />The skin isVERY high quality, but it took so long to apply it, and I had to use water on an electronic device... my device is fine but I really question the design here, if a younger child got this and attempted the application process, would they understand not to drown the device to prevent damage?"
"Works pretty well, but it barely fits a Samsung Note 4 (near impossible with the case on), and it busted my air vent after a couple of weeks.  It might be ok with sturdier air vents, but I'd be careful.  Something spring loaded that grips the sides of the air vent chamber might be a better design."
"The case is fine and the battery last as long as I need it. However, the audio jack extender broke within two weeks of purchase and since I listen to music often I am very upset."
You get what you pay for. If you buy a cheap screen the colour balance will not be great. Other than a sepia tone the screen functions well. I liked their instructions that they included.
I love my speaker and use it with computer and also to listen to music off my android cell phone and love how it can be set any where in your home and not need to be plugged into computer / phone / power outlet / etc. to use - It comes with usb and aux. cords and to charge it you have two choices : usb on computer or in a usb  phone charger into the wall outlet !
"Excellent product, good range, excellent service."
I love this case. I collect owls. It is durable. I have drop my phone with no damage. Fast shipping. excellent packaging. I would buy from this seller again.
"So let me start off by saying these Bluetooth headphones are amazing. I have been using them for a couple of days now and they meet all my expectations. I can barley tell there even there and they are very comfortable. My big thing is that I needed a headphone set that would not fall out my ears and this fit perfect. The sound quality is amazing, it hits the lows, highs, and mids all really well. The only reason I did not give five stars is because sometimes the music cuts out it is not very often though so I can't complain. Overall great product!!"
"Worked as advertised, great price arrived on time and no problems. Would recommend"
It's super fun I just wish it were more useful and protected my phone more. I wish it had bumpers for the screen. I switched this cover out for a two part ultra-protection case and I noticed a dramatic change in protection.
Excellent product
"Amazing, at first I was a bit skeptical about this case seeing as I would use it with my iPhone 5s but I have no regrets. It worked perfectly, I followed the instructions on the manual and tested it with a piece of paper (it was a success) after the initial test I decided it was trust worthy enough to place my phone inside. It worked just fine in the pool.<br /><br />I'm some of the reviews I noticed that lots of people had a problem with the cable thing that allows you to place it around your neck. Simple solution to that, just use a key chain instead of the flimsy part on the neck tie (tie the key chain to the main part of the neck tie and not to the detachable part) this will stop it from breaking and even if it does break the keychain will hold it up.<br /><br />Highly recommended product!"
works perfect
I refuse to give this item a rating I followed every step and this item doesn't work so don't waste your money
"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this case is awesome, so I had to. It actually makes the note 5 more comfortable to hold. It has a nice feel and is well made. Grips the phone tightly, however simple to take off to clean dust and build up under the case. I bought this exact case when I had my S6 edge and it fit awesome on that as well. Don't hesitate, buy this."
I tried to use this map on a 7 day backpacking trip in Glacier national park. Sometimes the maps didn't work when too close to the Canadian border? I would recommend using a map instead and leaving your GPS at home for back country backpacking in Glacier.
Been using this for a while now.  Still works great.  It's small and fits really well.
"Screen scratched quickly.  My previous Lifeproof was in my pocket all the time and never scratched.  This one has a perm scratch.  Protects from water and sweat, but screen needs to go back to the previous material (I assume they changed it since it reacted so different in this model.)"
Durable for everyday use by my 7 years old. The rotating center of the cover attachment functions as an excellent finger grip to hold onto the slippery iPad. The cover padding is thick and firm to protect the touch screen from any inadvertent shock. The padded snap-on back cover provides reasonable drop protection to the corners and to the side edges.
Did not work. Glad I paid $9 for it.
Surface area on this magnet holds my Note 4 perfectly. I bought products like this in the past that couldnt hold my Note 4. I was happy to find that this one did.
"Had an OtterBox for my S4.  After getting the S5, I opted to try a new case - mistake.  I had my phone less than a month and my 4 year old dropped it onto the floor.  Hit on the side and the screen got a crack across it.  Obviously, didn't protect from a simple fall."
"Didn't work for me , but the color is a perfect match."
I bought them for my 67 hear old mom & they're great. She loves them.
Very nice product very good quality love it I recommend it
"Nice radio, perfect size, works well, programing requires some research if you haven't done it before,  I spent 2 hrs to get my windows based  computer system de virused , then about 30 min trying to figure out how to make windows let me down load the required programing software, then I looked at videos on you tube and was programing these baby's Likity split,  always get the proper cable from milklor, do not get the cheep cable seen on a-z,  etc.  the program you need is called chirp and you will need the daily build,  I'm using these for simplex in wilderness areas and to monitor co fire and rescue, and of course noaa weather. These  radios have the solid feel of professional equipment, some people complained about the chargers but mine worked perfectly, may be a upgrade."
Works great.. The app i have on my phone lets me see what is going  on with my truck real time.
"Adorable. My son bought this. It is so cute. However, since purchasing it a girl borrowed it and we haven;t seen it since. Ha, I guess she thought it was cute too."
My second product from anker. Works real well. Had an issue with one of the ports but it turned out my cord needed to be replaced. Customer service was polite and quick to respond. No complaints here. Great product.
"I don't know if it's a defect with mine, or what.<br /><br />I received this ask week. Just opened it now. The lighting cable doesn't stay in the actual port.<br /><br />I have 4 cables. None stay plugged in. So rare third party, some are Apple certified.<br /><br />My car has a lighting cable port. Doesn't stay plugged in there either.<br /><br />Another downside.<br />When I turn the battery on. My service cuts out. From full, to no service. Kinda disappointed in this."
"Fits perfectly, feels really good, and the phone still feels slim. I would buy this item again."
"would be nice if there was a secure loop to run a strap through, however the quality is good and the fit is snug."
"Glass covered up the half the &#34;Home&#34; button. Did not match the phone at all.  ordered it right with the  case not sure how I ended up with the wrong one. Looked like heavy duty, but couldnt use it."
"I recently bought a refurbished iPhone, which came without a charging cable. I got this one to use instead. I have to say that I am thoroughly happy with the cord. It fits the slot perfectly. I can &#34;find&#34; the phone by pulling on the cord, which I do as little as possible because I'm sure it's not great for the cord and/or the phone. The phone charges in just about the same amount of time as my daughter's iPhone, which came with the original manufacturer cable. The last reason why I am so happy over a simple cord is that it is the exact same color as my phone. I know that's a silly reason, but I have several items charging from that outlet, and having them color-coded makes life just a little easier.<br /><br />For those reasons, plus the fact that I see my little iPhone and its matching cable and it makes me smile, I give this five stars."
Its a nice phone just a little to many scratches and scuffs to my liking. But thats me
"Case fits like a glove which is good.  Buttons are okay to press, I'd give them a B- but im picky.  Really the two big things that bother me are the fact that theres a weird little jagged edge right at the micro USB port that rubs my pinky when I hold it and its annoying; and when I take the case off, 90% of the time it removes the back of the phone, too, which is also super annoying and i always feel like its gonna break.  Case is pretty slim and sleek providing little to no shock protection but good otherwise."
"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I've ordered several of these cases in different colors for multiple phones and I love the kickstand function. I ordered this one to keep at work so I can see the notification light while working without keeping the volume up. I like to use other cases that don't have a kickstand, so I'll be able to snap this on at work and change back to my other case for the rest of the time. I was a little disappointed that they charged $5 for shipping, when the case didn't even cost me that much. That being said, even though it wasn't sent to me from Amazon/Prime, I did receive the case extremely quickly."
"Love this case!  I was looking to replace my wallet, as I hate carrying both in my line of work.  This case did the trick.  I carry 2 credit cards, my ID, some cash, and my phone.  All my rewards cards, etc. have been replaced by Android apps on my phone.  Convenient!  Love the magnetic strap that keeps it closed.  Seems like this case will last for a while.  Makes the phone significantly thicker when placing calls and having to hold to your ear, but if you use BT headset or speakerphone, it's not an issue at all. Even still, I have made many calls with it being in the case."
"Even though it's rubber and flexible, it fits like a glove and protects the iPod!"
This lil bluetooth was everything that I expected it to be.  It works well and paired quickly with my Galaxy Note 4. I mainly use it to listen to music while at work and it's great for that.  Battery life is about 2 hours and it recharges really quickly.  Call quality isn't great  but tolerable for short periods of time.  Bottom line this device is well worth the money.
Have this case on my s6 right now it has a very nice feel great texture not cheaply made! ♡♡ Love it
Daughter loves it!!! Very cute and sturdy. Great protection for her phone.
"Love this case. The fit is perfect and the back doesn't seem to scratch easily. The front lip keeps the screen off of whatever you place it on so you don't have to worry about taking advantage of the edge lighting. Easy to put on and remove, overall great case."
The quality is solid. Comes with a micro usb cables. Great!
Cheap quality and does not fit phone.
"These headphones sounds great and don't fall out while at the gym. I have to use the medium size rubber inserts while my girlfriend used the smallest size. (The biggest size were too big.) My girlfriend loves the color. They are study since they are constructed mostly out of metal. The headphones themselves are on the larger side, they stick out of your ear a little. I suppose if you had very small ears it might look a bit weird, other than that I really like them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
Wonderful little speaker. I bought it for my wife's office and it is perfect. Easy set up and there have been no issues. Probably wouldn't use it as large room speaker but that is not what it's designed for.
love
"This is exactly what I was looking for - A nice thin case that fits the iPhone perfectly.  My only complaint is that after about 4 months, it started to yellow a little - I loved how crystal clear it was at the start.  But at this price, I just purchased another and tossed the yellowed one out.  Perfect!"
"I'm one of millions of people that constantly wonder why Apple, the inventor of all kinds of cool products, can't seem to make a power cord capable of lasting more than a few months.  Shame on you, Apple, because you could do better but you can't or won't.<br /><br />Now enter the Anker cord.  I originally bought another cord on Amazon which was a few dollars less.  Needless to say that cord barely worked at first and quickly died completely.  I then found Anker and have been very happy for the 3 weeks I've had it.<br /><br />Materials, design and quality all seem good.  Good value and product...  They could teach Apple a few things, I think!"
"Quick delivery, stays on the phone great."
"Great protection for my phone. Ive dropped it a few times especially when getting out of my car, and still good. Easy to clean too."
"Cheap and flimsy. Lightning end came off and stuck in my iPad, had to use tweezers to get it out.  Will never buy this brand again."
"After having this case for a few months,  the paint is chipping all over. I do like the case.  It isn't too bulky,  and I feel like my phone is protected.  I wouldn't buy another one."
"this glass cover is is great, it fits perfect and was a great buy.  mine went on as easy as you could expect.  the dealer got right out super fast.  I recommend this product and the dealer."
"It was exactly what I needed it to do! Be mobile and charge my phone at the same time! For me, it was the perfect length!"
"I received the book within 2 days, about 5 days earlier as estimated by shipper. Awesome job and thank you!!!<br />Gleim is one of the best study guides and test-prep on the market, at least in my eyes. I used Gleim 15 years ago for my PPL  and I bought this book to study for my up coming review, to brush up on new and updated information on the ground and in the air."
"the bolt is not glued to the plastic, so the hold is wably/loose. i've owned one of these before. this one is clearly damaged."
Disappointing. Brand new they last maybe eight hours. Admittedly i am on the phone a lot but the Samsung batteries lasted at least 24 hours when new. Ya get what you pay for.
Love the cover and the fact that it has a magnetic closure. Seems to hold up to wear and tear.
"It's a really cool case. I get compliments on it, but the two thin pieces by the lock and volume buttons broke within 4 days of normal use. Not too happy about that."
"Had it for a week before it broke. There is a screw that holds the ball hinge to the strap.The ball hinge then is connected to the main part of the mount that holds the ipad. I had it mounted on the handlebars of my spin bike. When I moved my spin bike, I bumped the mount just slightly and that plastic surrounding the screw snapped.<br /><br />Returning the product and will look for other options."
"I was a little worried about the installation of the glass screen protector, this is my first one.<br />Actually seemed quite a bit easier than the plastic ones I'm used to installing<br />and it feels phenomenal to the touch, so much better than plastic."
"been using this charger in my car for a month now.  I constantly charge a galaxy s6 using gps, an iphone6, a Bluetooth streaming device, and sometimes an iPad. The unit performs perfectly!  I also bought anker 6ft usb to hide my cables. Again anker comes though"
"These fit fine, and we were able to finally get all the bubbles out, however, there's a sticker on the front of the screen protector and when you peel it off, it leaves sticky residue that we tried really hard to get off. We tried 3 protectors and over an hour of trying to clean it off but it was still sticky and discolored in those areas. We ended up having to peel the covers off so it was a waste of money. The product was cheap but I wish we hadn't wasted multiple dollars on shipping for something so useless."
works perfect
"Feels like my phone is truly protected in this case.  Unfortunately, the stand seems poorly designed and broke the first day I had it, causing it to no longer stay folded into place.  It still functions as a stand when I need it, but I have just taken the stand off due to the inconvenience it causes by not staying put away."
"Perfect, not too long, not too short. The suction works as advertised. The bottom fold out piece is not even necessary, as the clamps hold my LG G3 just fine as is. And I see that as a plus, because otherwise I'd have to fiddle with the charger cord a little since the charging port is on the bottom. Though there is an opening in the bottom piece, so a cord can go through it."
Never had a waterproof case.  Taking a little bit to get used to.  Great coverage for the phone.  My only complaint is I thought there would be more grip on the sides.
"It makes the cell phone more bigger in all dimensions. And does not sport a stand at the back. If you keep aside these, in my account, drawbacks the case is a good protection and serves the purpose."
"Very nice quality, slim profile phone wallet.  Great to carry with you when you need to make a quick run to pick up the kids or go to the grocery store.  Description is very accurate.  Fits I-Phone 6 perfectly.  Can easily hold two credit cards, driver's license, and dollar bills.  The wrist lanyard is an added plus.  Case appears to adequately protect I-Phone. Love the magnetic closure securing contents inside. I am definitely pleased with this item.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
"The phone was damaged, although advertised as &#34;In mint condition&#34;. The sound up and down button did not work,and the phone does not show how much charge there is, dies without warning. I paid premium for this piece of junk, was not returnable because I had opened it and by the time, my son , for whom I bought it became aware of the problems, it was over a month."
"Had an issue with my first shipped item and messaged the sender. With no hesitation they sent me a replacement and it works perfectly, my phone charges great and it was a very easy install. Highly suggest buying this product!"
"This product is a bit complicated to open, and close everytime I use it. The face piece and bottom plate snap together unlike the previous one I had that slide together and snap in the middle. I wish I knew that before I purchased. The usage of this product is simple, and it works however I expected more for the price I paid. It sometimes makes a loud buzzing noise, and the speakers are muffled because of the case. Product can be designed better, but it works."
This was advertised to operate with a Doro 410 phone. The plug does not fit. Also the picture shown here is not what I ordered or received.
These cords are very durable feeling. They seem better constructed then the actual apple cord and because they are certified I do not get an annoying message when plugging in. Bought these to replace my APPLE product cords that didn't even last a year.
I bought this for my son and he says it works great. I also bought one for my granddaughter and she loves hers too. She made a point to tell me about taking it on a trip with her where she knew she wouldn't be able to charge her phone.
"A lot larger than I was expecting. hard to close the case, at one point I felt like I was going to break it."
"If you want to cut down on your mobile phone usage, this is the phone for you.  Set up is simple - but make sure not to slip into accessibility mode or all the buttons become unresponsive.  The menu (needed to undo this) is cleverly hidden (hold down the bottom right button for long enough - but you may find this tricky in accessibility mode).  In this mode the phone can also lock you out completely with the easy solution of a hard reset - make sure to delete the backup of everything you have managed to install before doing that.  Switching between 4G and 3G networks is not a problem (the phone seems to have trouble doing this on its own) - just go 3 levels down into that hidden menu and change from CDMA / LTE mode to CDMA mode (you knew what those stood for didn't you?).  Then there is the the way they have pre-installed a bunch of apps you do not want and made them hard to remove.  This ensures that you have at least space for 4 medium sized apps that you do want.  Add to this that within weeks this phone got stuck in headphone mode.  What a great (if expensive) paper weight this phone makes."
Works great for iphone 5s. Clip is very difficult to open for any phone thats a bit larger (galaxy s5 or even iphone 6)
"I received a product discount for a fair review.  Great product, protects phone well!"
"Affordable price. Comfy. This is my second pair. Loved the color. This time I received a discount for reviewing the product. However, it is a well deserved review."
well i give a poor rating just because it did not adjust the output voltage at all... turning the pot screw
"Got this for my son's phone.  The design print is good, and the case is well made.  Warning: once the case goes on, it does not come off easily.  This is good, as it means that it should stay attached during a drop to the ground.<br /><br />We did have to trip some of the plastic away from the inner edge of the screen side as it was pressing on his glass screen protector and causing it to lift.  Simple fix, and won't be an issue if you don't have a glass screen protector."
"Holds strong on the dash, and shows no signs of coming off when hitting bumps in the road. I've been using this for over a year now and it works as intended. Great to be able to adjust the view in both portrait and landscape mode when using the phone for navigation.<br /><br />Great product. Ships fast and works as intended. 5 stars."
Please with the product.  Dropped the phone a few times and it has withheld the drop and kick test.  Great!
"Easy to install, good sound quality. The SD card is a nice feature (I was able to move my songs from my Garmin GPS)."
The belt clip broke after a couple of weeks using it.  Weak point is where the metal pin goes through the plastic ears.
earpiece is ok but the clip that goes around your ear stinks. it only comes with 2 clips and they both broke i've only had this unit for a month. i do remove it from my ear everyday and i would think the clips would be more flexable.
These cords Worked for about 3 days then said &#34;not compatible with iPhone&#34; and haven't worked since then. Great size and cute but won't work with iPhone so they don't do me any good.
"You can never have too many USB cables... and with different lengths this is an awesome pack. We used the longer cable in the car, the rest are used to charge a bunch of tablets and phones."
"It works great.  After shopping around, this was not only a quality product, but priced better.  Excellent bargain for excellent product."
Used it for a week with no other electricity. Worked as it should.<br />A pocket underneath would be great so the phone & charging battery could be tucked away during charge.
"Mophie chargers are excellent but this case is not.  I've owned two and in each case, the plastic belt clip has broken after a month or so of very normal use, dropping the phone to the floor in each instance.  The first instance was a few years ago and I foolishly assumed that this product would have been improved and bought a second one.  My mistake.  The shortcomings of the plastic fittings make this product unworthy of your purchase."
Great price for a great product. I was worried about the thickness of a glass screen protector but the beveled edge makes this screen protector a must on all my future phones.
"This is a very clever and handy way to hold my smart phone onto the steering wheel. I tend to hang out in the car and watch utube videos on the phone and this fits and holds my LG G4 phone perfectly. It's a bit of a stretch to get it over the edges, but it holds it securely. And the fact that the phone can be turned either upright or horizontally is great."
Protects my screen as described :) It's easy to apply if you follow the directions (just make sure you align it correctly because you can't lift it off if it settles). Also fits with a case which is a nice. Now I can throw my phone in my purse without worrying about the screen getting scratched.
Good qualities and a great seller.
I have so many cords running every where when I try to charge something it becomes a hassle! Well with this 5 port charger I can keep things a bit more organized! I put the fat square bread ties around the cord and then plug it in and then I know what is what. This charger helps me keep everything a bit more organized and charges super fast! I did receive this for an honest unbias review. Over all I am super happy with this charger.
I love how long this cable is it is way longer than the cable apple provides you with the iphone and ipad and its cheeper but its still a good quality cable. If you need a longer lightning to usb cable I highly recommend this one.
"I really like the case and the duel layer. I wish there was slightly more rubber on the corners, but it fits very nicely and is relatively easy to take apart."
"Very good alternative to having to install Bluetooth in your car or truck. Especially since you can choose literally any station. However it would be nice if it had an external Antena because there is a constant static in the background unless you have the transmitter in the right position. Other than that, great product for the price!"
"Great battery case! Better than Mophie. Bought 2, one for me and my wife and we both have never run out of power ever!"
"I love this phone holder for my car!  I got this one and the shorter one, and I love them both.  Instead of keeping your phone in your pocket or in your bag/purse when you get in the car, put it on this phone holder.  It is so much more convenient!  The taller one is more flexible in it's use because of it's multiple adjustment settings.  It turns left, it turns right, it swivels around, so you can custom fit it for your personal preference.  It is very sturdy and very convenient.  I always keep my phone in my phone holder while driving because I'm directionally challenged so I'm always on my GPS.  This phone holder is great because it sits high, so I can look at my GPS and keep an eyes on the road.  It has adjustable EVERYTHING so it will basically fit in any car cup holder.  The workmanship on this is superior to other phone holders I have used in the past.  It isn't very bulky either so it doesn't really get in the way of anything else.  This is a great product for anyone that pretty much has a phone and a car."
Poor design and implementation. AVOID buying. Weak voice recognition. It usually gets it wrong. Navigation screens confusing. Updates far and few between. Newest map is six months old before it is issued and already 1 year out of date. Outdone by a $40 TomTom
"I have used this dash camera for several months , it stll works well. that is the point I am here to write a reveiw after several months . the resoution is good to me .Day or night version  is acceptable , you can see clearly what happed in front of your car and other car license number  as the price and quality , I do not think other camera is better than this pc. I have bought GS8000 as before , but after 15 days when i used , I shipped back to amazon , the quality is disastering , the screen always get blank then you can do nothing . love this pc and reconmend it to my other family."
Thinner than other cases I have used.  Materials seem to be high quality.  it feels really good in my hand holding the phone.  The fit is excellent.  I tried my remote function for the TV and it worked fine.
I have an iPhone 5s carrier lock was sprint It did not work I ended up just pay more money for an unlock that did work
"Fits well, seems lie it will hold up better than some of the other cases for the old Xperia. The back of the case is better quality than some of the more flimsy cases we have tried. The case doesn't block the camera like many of the other Xperia cases do."
This is a pretty good portable backup battery pack for the money. It charges relatively fast and it charges my phone well. I can get one complete charge for my phone out of it.
"This is a great looking cell phone case, but it`s more for a woman than a  man. That`s the only reason I couldn`t use it, otherwise it is made well."
"Purchased for my Note 5. In fact I bought to of them, different colors because of the price. Fits the phone well and feels good in your hands. It is a thin case so I do not how well it protects the since I am very carefully with the phone. This is not an otterbox but I did not expect it to be that much protection. I like the style and the fit, easy to get on but a little difficult to get off, but that is ok if you don't take it off and on alot. Would be this again for my wife's phone when she is ready to upgrade."
"Do not buy this head unit.  You will HATE it.<br /><br />Pros: Sound quality is great.  Connectivity is very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It has a HORRIBLE user interface.  No preset buttons, menus upon redundant menus. It's terrible when you're parked, so good luck trying to make it work how you want while driving.<br />2. It has abysmal build quality.  Like others have mentioned, it randomly decides to stay on every once in a while even when you remove the key to the vehicle, and you either have to disconnect the battery or the fuse to shut it down.  It freezes CONSTANTLY.  It reboots itself for no reason.  Oh, and my favorite: every single time you first touch the volume nob or buttons to change your station upon initially powering on the unit, it crashes the face display and has to restart itself.<br />3. No preset buttons.  Everything has to be done through a left/right button.  That design decision makes zero sense whatsoever.<br />4. Curved display reflects sunlight at any angle.<br />5. And while we're talking about the display, it is absolutely horrendous.  The worst--the ABSOLUTE WORST--display I have EVER had in a piece of car audio equipment.  Completely and utterly unreadable in sunlight.  So now, while driving, you have a unit with no dedicated preset buttons causing you to scroll through channels you can't see.  THANKS A LOT, KENWOOD.<br /><br />This head unit is terrible.  Do not buy it.  Does it sound great?  Sure.  But that is NOT worth it these days with so many other great options to purchase.  It crashes, it's frustrating to use, and even when it works flawlessly, the display is completely useless."
"The case fits the phone snug and looks as it appears in the image. My only issues with it are that there is hardly any protective lip space in the front to protect the phone in case of accidental face drops, and the kickstand is simply a thin plastic material. This case is solid enough though for simple drops. It's good mostly for the aesthetic appeal."
I love this color and the brushed metal feel. However I found that it seemed to block my streetpass abilities somewhat.
It quit working after 44 days. Do not waste your money.
Slim. Convenient. Easy to use.
fit exactly.  Excep tthe magnet was not very strong.
My friend's phone is as good as new.  This repair isn't for the timid but if you're not afraid of small parts and you're careful about keeping track of what screw goes where this is an easy way to make someone very happy.<br /><br />I just wish it were cheaper.  The part for a comparable-age iPhone is less than half as much.
"I bought it for $15.99 and for that price I would say it is OK.  I have set it up to recharge an external 6Amp\hr battery pack, it takes about two full sunny days to recharge this pack when it is completely depleted. I use the battery pack to recharge my other stuff. The reason I use it that way is because it does not really want to charge my phone or other 5V items directly ( they always seem to disconnect and then reconnect and do not really charge). The battery pack does not seem to mind and even looks to be partially recharging on somewhat cloudy days.  The case is pretty nice since it folds into a very pack-able size and will fit into a day pack without wasting a lot of space.  The only thing I do not like is that the material the case is made from definitely is not protected from U.V.  I have had the solar panel outside recharging for about 7 days and the material of the jacket is changing colors to a somewhat purple color I can only imagine this will not last for more than a couple of months of charging use before the material degrades to the point of falling apart."
The speakers did not sound as well as I thought they would because they were jbls. The highs could be a little bit more crispier sounding.
Exactly what I expected.  Easy to install.
This charger works awesome. I have a Galaxy s6 with an Otter Box. It charges a little slower than the wall charger that came with the phone but more than adequate. It's really not super picky about how the phone is positioned  but the light will flash red/green immediately if it's not happy with where you put it. The charger is pretty small... smaller than I expected which is a plus. I haven't measured but I'd say about 2.5-3&#34; across the widest point. It has a nice rubbery top and bottom so it won't slide around and the light is tiny and not crazy bright as I've read about other similar chargers (ie. Lighthouse in my bedroom etc...). It charges until full and then trickle charges to keep you at 100%. Overall I'm very happy after a couple weeks of use and i would highly recommend this product as a great bargain and well thought out design.
Very good product. Sturdy and looking good (the red color looks better than the black one). I feel my iPhone is well protected in this case.
Fits snug! I really like the look and feel of this case. Light weight. Delivered way ahead of delivery date.
"i've only used this cable for a couple of days but so far it works great, no problems"
"Nice battery, but I'm returning it because the product dimensions are incorrectly listed (as of 8/31/15). It is listed as being the same size as the Astro E5 2nd Gen, but it is significantly longer than the E5. The upgraded matte finish is cool but it's more slippery than the piano finish on the E5. It doesn't have a flashlight like the E5 and the battery lights don't stay on very long when you check the battery strength, whereas on the E5 the battery meter would remain lit up for about 30 seconds."
The 10 foot charging cord is so useful because you can charge your phone from anywhere in the room.  The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating is that you get what you pay for; these cords usually stop working after a couple months.
"Ordered this sub enclosure as I really wanted some bass in my pick up.  It's a DVC SUB factory wired @ 2 Ohm's so I took the sub out and wired to 8 Ohm as my amp is not 2 ohm stable.  Really impressed with the sub, thought was a little flimsy sub in the enclosure. But the weight of the actual sub-woofer that contributes to 85% of the enclosure weight.  Have this little fella installed in my 1990 single cab Toyota Hilux (Pickup)  Hooked up to a old school Rockford Punch 60.2 bridged; @ 14.7 volts 280 Watts!  Perfect fit behind the seat...seat all the way back too! Give's a real nice bass too...not the awful boomy bass.  Good bass that's low!  Need now to upgrade my high end to perfect balance."
Broke after a few days
I ordered an IPhone 5C case I got an IPod 5 case.
"I do own a few car charges; some I enjoy better than others but for the most part, they have done their jobs with no problems. I opted in for this 4 Port USB Car Charger by Celltronix because I own another one of their products and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This 4 Port Charger arrived packaged well without any damages visible. It looked exactly as the advertised pictures so there were no unexpected surprises on my end.<br /><br />So what gives this 4 Port USB Car Charger a different look is the way the USB connection ports are placed!! Instead of a really long and bulky looking charger, the 4 ports are placed on both sides of the head. So I no longer have to worry about charger cords protruding from the top. That was an instant plus for me!<br /><br />I took this 4 Port USB Charger right away to my car and put it in use. The power indicator light showed up instantly when I turned the car on. Before I connected my iPhone and iPad, I connected my charger cables to be sure the product would not get hot during use. My results were negative so I proceeded to connect my iPhone and iPad with instant charging success.<br /><br />Overall as of now, I have had no problems with this device and I have no complaints. I think it is well designed and made. I really am looking forward to long-term use from it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"I bought it for my wife's iphone sometime last year. Looks really nice. But after couple of months it stopped working without any reason. My wife didn't even use it that often, she usually charges her phone at home.<br />It was wastage of money.<br />Will definitely NOT recommend."
"I really like this product for charging several devices at once: iPhone, Kindle HD and Kindle reader.  I've tried other products similar to this that would not charge or were very slow.  This one does the job. I've very pleased."
My phone wouldn't fit properly even though I bought it for the iPhone 5. The bottom piece to cover the charging port broke in about 2 days.<br />Do not waste your time on this product!
Works fine. Havent had it long so will see how it holds up. I love the long cord. I use it on an older ipad i have.
"I purchased these headphones for my 2.75 year old for a airplane trip. The things I was looking for were: comfort, volume control, durability, connectivity to another pair (I also have a 5 year old). Lil Gadgets headphones fit the bill exactly. I read many reviews of headphones for children & was torn between cutesy character ones that I knew my kids would love and more simple designed ones like these. In all the reviews I read comfort & volume were big issues. I decided any headphones I purchased must have padding at the top so the kids could wear them without discomfort. The ability to connect the headphones without a splitter is genius. The simplicity of the design makes them a joy to use. I read other reviews of this product which people said the volume was too low and their kids could not use them on the airplane. I did NOT find this to be true at all. My kids could hear perfectly well, and we were even seated next to the wing. Overall my kids LOVE these headphones, had no problem wearing them for extended periods, the fact that they fold into themselves also makes travel easier and more compact, the kids were able to hear fine & are excited to use them on trips now. In the end the fact that they are simple, no crazy color or designs were a plus, they look just like my husbands so the kids feel very grown up when they use these. The cord is fantastic, it's like a shoelace material & I can tell they will last longer with this design. I also like the fact they each come with their own dust bag (makes it so much easier to travel and carry around) If you are looking for children's headphones, these are superior to any others you will find for this price point. I highly recommend these headphones for toddlers and young children!"
Piece of crap.  Just for decoration.
"After second use, it would not turn off. After letting the battery. drain, it would not turn on or light up when charging. I tried a new charger and nothing changed."
The pins are so rigid they can not be spread to fit snugly in any outlet. This charger takes almost twice as long as the OEM unit to charge my phone and tablet.
"Awesome head set, Great sound quality, easy to use and comfortable. Connects quickly to my phone. I like the fact it works  with the I Phones voice commands. Good Value"
awesome. You can adjust to whatever length you want and it will lock then you can rewind from that position with a little pull of the wire. You don't have to extend to full length to rewind like others. Good design.
"Its just okay. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to take a chance on it. My previous phone was a Nexus 5, and even though this phone has more memory and faster speed on paper, in actual use I don't see much difference. Its been a month since I got it, and its already sporting a cracked screen, it is not very tough at all, I have had mobile phones since the early 90's and this is the first phone I have ever broken. Asus wants nearly 100 bucks to fix it, not worth it to me for such a mediocre device.<br />Battery life is atrocious, off the charger at 6am and by noon lots of times its at 50% battery or lower. I am not a gamer nor do I watch video, I just email, talk and text, and social media. Unacceptable.<br />As soon as funds are available, I'll be looking for something else."
The cover around the band comes of after a few days of use and heavy sweating. I received a replacement and it did the same thing 4 days later.Only part that stayed as it is described was the screen protector. Very upset I wasted money on this and still got charged for a faulty product.
Thought the rhinestones were raised and physible but instead it's fake. So got a little disappointed when received the item. Other than that it's fine.
Got what I ordered.  Works great.<br />Marty S
This charger packs a lot of charge for its size. I can get 2-3 full charges for my iPhone out of it before needing to recharge.
"I tried to scratch it with a knife.  I could not.  It went on easy. Bubbles practically eliminated themselves.  Make sure you place it high enough so that the top edge is above the front camera. Very tight tolerance and I put mine on a little low but luckily not too low. I also seem to have put it on slightly crooked, best evidenced in the photo of the lower left corner.  Curved screens on mobile phones is all the rage but it sucks for screen protectors.  This one does a fine job. It covers every pixel on the screen, left to right, and beyond top to bottom. Glare is not too bad. It's difficult to see fingerprints. It's easy to clean if you do get a smudge on it.  Very happy."
"WASTE OF MONEY. First, I am in the U.S. and I received this item with a wall charger that with a plug that doesn't fit into U.S. outlets, I'm assuming it's a European plug of some sort. As I was leaving for my vacation in 2 days I kept the device. THEN on a 3 hour drive using the car charger the entire time the battery died. Tried to remove the charger from the gps unit but it was STUCK. Finally pulled hard on it and of course the plug ripped apart leaving the metal piece STUCK inside the GPS unit. I am now on vaction with NO GPS to use and will be going to a local store to buy another one. SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY AND JUST BUY A DIFFERENT GPS UNIT FIRST!!!  On the positive side - I called Amazon once I returned home, great Amazon customer service, refund was very easy."
"Awesome!!  Makes for a nice, dressy bracelet at weddings."
I recently bought this case without reading that Otterbox does not make an Armor series case for the iPhone 5c. So I gave it to my mom and I've finally switched to the LifeProof brand which is a little more expensive but the same quality and less weight. LifeProof also comes in the color white.
"- The performance is kind of ok. Not the best though. Good for the price I guess.<br /> - Not 100% comfortable to wear. It keeps kind of slipping off of the ear. Probably there might be a special way to wear it on. I have not figured it out yet.<br /> - Not good for active sports wear.<br /> - Works fine with my iphone 5s.<br /> - Has issues with my Win 7 laptop. Some issue with the drivers. I contacted the manufacturer and they refused to support it. They say the problem is elsewhere and not the device since it is working well with my iphone. I am not 100% sure how these things are supposed to supported but, I thought the windows drivers were supplied by the manufacturer. I might be wrong. But now I am stuck with a device that I really wanted to use with my laptop and I cannot. No help from any online websites or forums."
Great case. Easy to hold onto the phone. Attractive case.
I only gave it four stars because I got it for a friend he said it was great he tried two other batteries from some were else one lasted a week and the other started to expand in a day or two and these one has been going strong for six weeks and no problems so far great battery
"[[VIDEOID:643dca462e9a63b11b4fd427e1305850]] For the price it is great. I've had it now for about two years. It has seen the summer heat and -20F winter days. The internal battery is not really useful at all and fails quickly, but that wasn't a problem for me as I have the camera turn on and off with the vehicle's auxiliary power. It will also chew through maybe two micro SD cards a year, but that's because it's continuously writing to the card. Today I took it apart. I was surprised at the production quality, however the battery was bloated and had ruptured. I'm just going to replace it with an old cell phone battery and put it back to work.<br />I suppose I would give it a poor review if I had paid more for it, but for the price point it's great.<br />I have included a video of me reviewing a video using the included software (it is on the card, just insert into a computer and run the application). You can see my speed at the top and a google map on the side."
Very good price for certified cables. They work great!
"I am 67 yrs. old and a rookie at using GPS's.  I bought this to use on a trip from Missouri to Wyoming, and will continue to use it."
I received my very first selfie stick today and am completely in love! The seller provided very fast shipping and packaged it well. I never knew selfies could look so much better. This hold my phone securely and I am able to make sure the photos are taken at a flattering angle. No more double chin or horrible pictures. I would highly recommend this to all cell phone selfie addicts it works amazing. You'll never have to worry about dropping your phone or posing weird to get a good photo.<br /><br />The company provided a sample for testing and review purposes.
"Ordered almost a year ago. I was sent a faulty, mix match digitizer and screen, I sent it back being promised I would be sent a New one....8 months later I still have nothing."
it is fatter than just a regular cover.  My teen daughter did not like it at all.  It may be okay for a guy who never puts the phone in his pocket and wants to carry a few cards with him.
I purchased it for a 200W Coleman quick air pump.  A few months later I took it out of the package for a camping trip. It first kept beeping at me then did not work at all.  Amazon will not let me return because beyond the 30 days.
"This was mostly easy to put together, but the top of the screen where it locks down into the back of the phone had an issue, it seems their form is off because I was only able to get it flush by filing down the right hand corner before it would lock in.  Also, on the left upper corner, the glass is separating from the plastic display portion.  Disappointed in this, but it is an aftermarket product, can't expect quality I guess.<br /><br />I bought a phone cover that wraps around the whole screen so it will hold it all together.<br /><br />I was impressed with the little tool kit, the screwdrivers are magnetized, which is super important when dealing with such tiny screws.<br /><br />I like others took to youtube and other websites to actually get the repair completed, because the instructions and website included in the package did not help at all."
"I was a little bit skeptical about this case, especially because my iPhone 6 is brand new, HOWEVER, the case is literally perfect. Some cases can make the Plus very bulky but this is very lightweight and slim and the stand has worked wonders for watching Netflix :) The case is exactly the color as it appears in the picture and is an easy grip! Well done Spigen, well done!"
Phone is great. I mainly use for texting and keeping me organized and it has a very nice camera built inn. Battery life is the only issue it doesn't last very long.
"So far so good.  For running you defiantly don't want to leave the chord bouncing on your neck.  It makes a loud thud sound every step.  BUT... what I do is either tuck it around my ears so the rest of the chord fits tight behind my head, or just wear the chord on top of my head.  The ear pieces with the right inner ear hook fits sooooo good.  I love this technique, rather than an outer ear hook.  Super conformable and really solid.  Defiantly wont fall out. I've had the blue tooth discount a couple of times.  Might be because the blue tooth receiver is on the right side.  I moved the phone to my right arm and it's been working pretty good.  My amazon blue tooth for my garage speakers always takes over and kicks the Mpow Swift off my phone.  So I have to leave my house before I connect it.  For the price I think it's a good deal.  But I've only used it twice on 4 mile runs."
"This is hands down the best thing I have ever purchased for my vehicle! I LOVE it. I have had a couple magnet holders for my truck in the past just checking them out and they all seemed to hold a little better than this. If you stick the metal piece that is attracted to the magnet to the back of your case/phone then it will definitely not go ANYWHERE. It's a very strong hold and I couldn't live without it anymore. Goes very well with a Bluetooth radio system because you don't have to mess with any wires at all unless you are charging. So you can just get in your vehicle and literally slap this thing onto your cash and BAM, it's there until you want it again. Everyone that rides with me is in amazement and I recommend it highly everytime. The main reason this item sold me is because it is so small and doesn't take much room up on my dash. The pivot is designed perfectly, it moves to where you want it with just the right amount of grip and once you let your phone go it stays put in any direction you leave it be. That was one of my main wonders when I was shopping is if it will stay tilted up or down or to the side, it will. Quit reading this review and buy the thing, I swear you won't regret it.<br /><br />The only thing I would say would be the &#34;cons&#34; is that I have noticed after having it for some time it has faded from the sun. Will attach a picture of the new color, if brown wouldn't match your vehicle and this will be in the path of the sunlight, you may want to purchase another similar item."
"I bought thewse a while ago so they've stood the test of time. Today, I needed to replace the tip but decided use a different color for a while. It struck me that the one I'd used for 6+ months looked as good as the new one. Always spot one one the touch screen and handy with the attachable cord....these stylus are the perfect blend of form anf function."
I brought this for my big brother for work he loves it and it's really easy to use.
"I've bought and used this car mount for my iPhone 6 recently. This is not a paid, free sample or sponsored product review. Here is my product review on this item:<br /><br />Packaging - Small, sturdy and packaged nicely. Items were wrapped nicely inside and came with two small cards with product and company information.<br /><br />Setup - Setting up the car mount is fairly easy. There are two main parts: the head (where the phone is held), and the body (where the mount stands/sticks to a surface). Connecting these two parts were fairly easy but did have some slight trouble when connecting them at first. Just make sure you hear the &#34;Click!&#34; sound when connecting the two pieces for connection confirmation.<br /><br />Usage - When using the car mount, the look, feel, and maneuverability of the car mount is great. Screen is completely visible, no blocks and can be corrected into the position you feel most comfortable. Landscape or portrait the phone when placed on the car mount is good. Sturdy, does not shake or wobble.<br /><br />Dis-assembly - After using the item and putting it away is also easy. Just undo the click for the two main pieces and voila! your done.<br /><br />Setbacks - I've only encountered two setbacks when using this product. 1) This product price will fluctuate. I bought mine for $10.99, week and a half later it was at $5.99. Could not get the difference because thanks to Amazon's pricing policy after 7 days you can not get the differentiated price difference. My loss.<br /><br />2) When using the car mount, the phone has a bottom bar where it &#34;sits&#34; comfortably, this bar unfortunately is opened in the middle for charging on the go, but blocks the headphone jack. So if you're in need of using the headphone jack while in the car for calls, or the AUX cable then it becomes tricky. Luckily I found a makeshift solution to the problem. You connect whatever you want into your headphone jack and THEN you place it on the car mount. Thanks tothe claws of the car mount on the side, it still stays in place with minimal to no movement.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy about this car mount. Would recommend to a friend. Any questions or comments feel free to post below."
Great fit and all buttons works through the bumper.  just enough of a berm around it so that neither screen nor back rest on whatever you set it down on.<br /><br />Vendor shipped quickly and packing was sufficient.
"A quality product from a quality brand. A few considerations:<br /><br />1. The case is easy to take on and off because it's a bit flexible<br />2. Slim, but you can still feel the increased size of your phone. But the iPhone is slim to begin with so no big deal.<br />3. Buttons are functional, only slightly harder to press<br /><br />This case is for those who don't really want a case but need the protection. A worthwhile investment considering the hefty price tag on the iPhone. I was given this case for my objective evaluation."
"Excellent product, fits great... I paired this up with my favorite case the NewTrent Trentium (removed stock plastic screen protector and used this tempered glass) it looks flawless! Thank you JETech for making such a high end, quality tempered glass screen protector for such a reasonable price... Very satisfied customer for life here! :) Thank you"
Brought my phone back from the dead. Very happy with the time it took for delivery
This wallet is so cute and exactly what I was looking for. It even fits in my back pocket.
It's a very good case for the money.  Bot an extra glass piece and replaced the plastic front.  I am happy with both.
"didnt work out for me display was scrambled purple and white you might have much better luck than me, if you have a problem do contact seller"
"My son loves this. It's not much bigger than the phone itself, so it's not bulky and he loves the kickstand feature."
"This is a great screen protector as it nicely fits the face of the phone, without interfering with the curved edge of the S6. I also like the provided back cover as it will cover the back of the phone from minor scratches etc even though the phone will be in a case all the time."
"Picture and description showed RED as the color of the case, when I got the package it was SF Giants Orange."
"Guess this is my last Blu phone - WiFi disconnects when the phone goes to sleep. Contacted Blu support and they advised to perform a hard factory reset of the phone. I bought this phone after returning the [[ASIN:B00PYWQ7SI BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, White]] which had a similar problem (but way worse as WiFi would not reconnect unless it was disabled and reenabled).<br /><br />That's 2 Blu phones in 2 weeks with similar issues..I thought it was a defect the first time, but the 2nd time? I'm not so sure anymore...<br /><br />The Studio X is a decent phone otherwise (nice looking, good display, nice pics, pretty responsive, latest OS, etc) but the WiFi issue is a dealbreaker for me..."
"This was the first Quick Charge 2.0 Portable battery I found available, and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />I don't even use my older chargers anymore, as Quick Charge charges my phones (that are Quick Charge compliant) so much faster (hours faster). This works perfect when you need a quick burst of extra power for your music, phone calls, gps, etc.<br /><br />The price is also competitive. Thanks Aukey!"
"Great product.  Just check the size before you buy.  Others might see this a bit big and weighty but the capacity is great.<br />Also, there is no instruction for the flashlight feature.  You have to press the power button about 3 seconds, then it will light up.  Same thing when you turn it off."
"I like the idea of  using this product to give my dog something to chase.  However, it is a little challenging for me to direct. Good news, my son has no problem manipulating this product."
Works exactly as advertised. Very good product.
"Great!!! Love it, haven't dropped w case on yet so haven't tested it that way but the case is great quality.  but sometimes comes apart"
"Great, works well, attractive"
Came when it said it would. Inexpensive. Good product.
Works well for the cost and value if you don't want to sell your arm for a phone case
"I am rough on phone holsters. These fit my iPhone 6 very well and I order them 2 at a time. They have a belt loop, so I don't lose my phone by it slipping off."
"I love the quad lock, however the little rubber bands break too easily.  Just normal handling of your bike while loading it on your rack or into your vehicle, can cause them to break.  Of course you can use the zip ties, but then the mount does not seem as secure or tight.  There has to be a better way.  For now, I am using old fashioned rubber bands and keep a few of them handy in my bike bag just in case."
"I like:<br />- Been through 3 or 4 drops onto carpet with this case, no damage at all.<br />- Sturdy construction<br />- Dust protection for headphone and micro usb port<br /><br />I dislike:<br />- Plastic case is difficult to slip over the rubber gasket at first<br />- No grip compared to my last (leather) case. The plastic is smooth. I've dropped it a few times because of this.<br />- Buttons are stiff and hard to push until it is broken in (maybe 3-4 months). Even then, you lose some of the tactile feedback of the button. Still worth it.<br /><br />Note:<br />- I'm not using the plastic screen protector. The Galaxy S3 comes with gorilla glass, so no need."
"I love this case! The only reason I gave it one less star is because I cannot fit my headphone cord into the hole through the case when I want to listen to music. In order to do so, I have to remove the case."
"This is a very nice case for my iPhone 6. The phone fits nice and snug and I do not have to worry about it falling out. The case does a great job at protecting the phone from bumps, dings, scraps and scratches. It also does a nice job of protecting the phone from medium drops. I have dropped mine a couple times and the phone came away with no damage. All the cut outs and buttons are perfectly placed so there is easy access to all the ports and the buttons are easy to find and press. I can plug up my charger cable and earphones without having to remove the case. The front of the case has a nice lip around the edge of the screen so the glass never touches any surfaces. The case adds very little thickness to the phone which is a huge plug in my book. The cover is clear so I can see the awesome look of my iPhone 6. It also does not show finger prints or other smudges like other clear cases I have had. The lanyard is a nice touch to a great case. I can now wear my phone around my neck and not worry about dropping it when my hands are full. I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review."
These are not the 2a chargers and will not work with items that require that power input. Not equivalent to the standard power adapter for apple products.
"I got it and had to return it because I realized that it wasn't going to protect my phone as well as the otterbox has been...I like the design, but this color is a lot more neon than it shows in the picture. If I could do it all over again, I would go with the light blue I saw somewhere else on Amazon. The back is really slippery, not a lot a grip, but not horrible!"
"I love the phone but there's a problem with the battery, it did not charge to the fullest after a week it cannot charge none at all have the phone and cannot use it can you please send me a replacement battery thank you"
Perfect
"Great phone, greater price. 10/10 would get phone again"
Like that my kids can't destroy their iPads now
"works as advertised!  Takes awhile to charge, but can charge many iPhones and other items."
"AMAZING! It has kept my phone in one piece for the last few years. Countless drops and all, it has been a saving grace!"
The case is sturdy and eye pleasing. It is bulky but manageable more in a purse than a pocket. The clip is handy. Glad my search is over. Worth the price.
"It has been a lovely case so far and taken a lot of falls. It is not as pastel like as it is in the picture, but I still like the color."
"I tried various different phone holders, this is the most solid one. It works well with regular cars. For tall vehicles such as minivans, however, it is a little too low in position."
Great battery case recharges phone for more than one full charge.  Does not sync in battery case. Good protection as a case also.
"The quality of this case was extremely impressive!  I ended up getting two more different colors, was really surprised and will never purchase a case in the store again.... Thanks 😁"
"Great product. Quality, snug fit. Does a great job holding up to 3 credit cards. Don't bother trying more. Highly recommended."
I bought the black for my black Apple watch sport. I love how it looks and protects my watch. The price is perfect and the quality is good. Very happy with the product.
Does the job well. Great product for the price.
"My iPad Air immediately didn't like this cord.  Out of the package, these cords looked impressive with a cool nylon braid inside a plastic outer covering...  I was immediately optimistic, but unfortunately it was an immediate disappointment.  It would barely trickle a charge to the iPad...  As in after 8-10 hours it was still only 70% charged.<br /><br />Within a few days, the bits comprising the plug head itself (the part that plugs into the tablet) so that then the cord had to be resting just so in order to work at all...  Needless to say I returned it to Amazon and spent a couple bucks more for an Anker brand cord which has performed flawlessly.<br /><br />In defense of this cord, it does come a 2-pack.  When the first one failed, I just returned the pair and never tried using the second one.  Perhaps they are so cheap to make in China that they just provide two rather than having quality control at the factory!  Although the second cord could have been fine, based on my experiences with the other one, I would absolutely not recommend this product."
"Pretty much the best bang for buck head unit. Feature-wise it goes toe to toe with all the 600-1k head units out there, and I'm not a hardcore audiophile so the quality it gets out of my stock 2005 Tacoma speakers is phenomenal.<br /><br />Do NOT buy that $15 bypass thing for the parking brake. Just take the green wire and tape it to the head unit hahaha. Or I loosened a screw and wrapped the wire around it so it's constantly connected to the body of the HU, which grounds it and now I have video all the time. Saves you the trouble of finding which wire in your car is the parking brake wire and tapping into your factory wiring. This is the video that opened my eyes to this: https://youtu.be/hd0rz3iMrPQ?t=1m27s<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - The menu navigation takes a few min of learning but in general it does make sense and is quite easy<br />  - The customizable color themes means it now matches my interior lights perfectly. EVERYONE asks what the stock radio was like, because it matches factory look so perfectly<br />  - Boot up time is super fast. Pretty much 3-5 sec after ignition til you get audio<br />  - Its bluetooth connectivity with my iphone is even better than my BMW, invoking my phone to start playing music right away. With my BMW I have to pull out my phone and get the music going.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - Wish it was easier to figure out when some features are enabled / disabled. For example the AV In/Out is always grayed out for me until randomly it was enabled. The My Vehicle is still disabled for me. Probably RTFM issue.<br />  - It didn't perfectly fit my double-din dash kit for my Tacoma, even though the kit got rave reviews for perfect fitting. So I'm not sure if this thing is just slightly above double-din or my kit is wonky..."
After a day I'm going to send it back. I can't hear the person on the other end very well and if I turn my head it makes a loud noise.
"I did not work. It is the second time trying to buy this item. I just wanna give up, i do not even want a refund. I am just gonna buy less items thru here."
I really like this it fits into my purse and I can find it because of the color<br />and it does the job!
"The case fits my phone well. I was bike riding, my phone dropped face down in the street, and survived with no damage. I was impressed!"
"This one is nice but it did not close all the way. Plus when talk, I had to use my hand held the case open so it is inconvenience and I do not use it now. I only use it for about a week."
Excellent
works perfect
"I bought this over a year ago, still works great.  Hope this was a bit more compact, then even easier to carry during traveling."
Great case nice bulky and protects my screen and camera well.
Very pleased with this extra battery for my LG G3 cell phone. Have no complaints. Would recommend it to anyone.
Received extremely quick.  Was easy to apply.  I like the feel of the screen much better with the screen protector on.  I just hope it does actually protect the glass from shattering.
"The case design is as it shoes in the picture and its good. however the iPhone needs to be more snug in the case, it seems it a little loose and it can easily be popped out."
Product came earlier than anticipated. The batteries seem to hold up just as well as the original LG battery.
i dropped my galaxy 5 times and there are only three cracks that appear on the screen! imagine if i didnt have this ballistic screen cover?! it is great. the reason i gave it 4 stars is due to the diffaculty of installation. You cannot take it off and readjust the cover it wont stick again. other than that its great if you hav invested in a phone.
Installed easily.  Video was a nice touch.
"The cover itself is still holding together.  However, the camo image started wearing off immediately, just by putting it in his pocket. I took maybe a month or so before it was unrecognizable. It is now just silver."
I liked this brand so much that I purchased another case for a different phone. It resembles the Outer Box.
Much nicer and solid that any other case I've used. Provides excellent protection
"Looks exactly like the picture, comes with lanyard. Tested with paper towels and other various paper items. Works just fine. Just be sure to completely close the top."
This case is horrible I just received it yesterday and it is already coming apart this is complete bull s***
My daughter is extremely satisfied with this case. Fits the iPod Touch 5 perfectly and provides a better grip. Colors are bold and match well with the original pink color of the unit.
"I've used this at a water park, amusement park, and the beach. The Velcro strap stay on my arm for all of the roller coasters and I was able to record the ride. I had it in the ocean completely submerged at some point and it worked! Some water got into the top plastic sealing part but that was it. It never got to my phone. Totally worth it!"
Wrong size and it'll cost more to send it back then it did to buy it. I'm gunna sell it on ebay. Lol
Arrived fast. I gave it four stars because it don't always turn the phone off when shutting case you still need to shut it off manually.
"I have been amazed at how great this has been for my phone. I took my time, followed the directions carefully to apply the screen.  I can't tell its on the phone, but I feel it has saved my screen unlimited times.  I think careful application is the key.  This screen has surpassed all the screens I had on my other phones."
"Love it!  But over time, there will be dye transfer from your jeans if you are the type to put in your back pocket :)"
"Purchased this item on June 4th, 2014. It worked perfectly until two weeks ago when it stopped working when attached to my laptop. For whatever reason, it still works fine when plugged into a wall mount."
"I have an old car and with no AUX port or bluetooth. I have tested few bluetooth FM transmitter and the latest one is the Rii Geartist GB01.  The box includes a magnetic back GB01, magnetic backplate sticker & dual car charger. Below are few pros and cons which will help you figure if this product is good for you.  PROS: 1. Packing is frustration free so it good. 2. The design is smooth and nicely done. 3. Its got volume control with channel changer, dedicated FM signal button and a button to accept calls and pause them. 4. Bright FM signal numbers. 5. Good signal once you find an empty one in your local area.  CONS: 1. I faced static sound issues after I started driving my car even once the GB01 was connected. After some driving distance the static lowered and I had to bump up the volume for a better sound.  Lastly I would say that this product is good and has great potential to give you endless musical experience.  Note: I got this product to test and provide my unbiased opinion"
I only use it on road trips and so far it works great as long as I have a cell tower signal.
Battery died after one charge only.Useless phone.
"Was expecting something sturdier, but instead it's a piece of plastic that's painted silver.  Looks better in pictures."
"When I try to charge battery through the solar panels, the battery light increases to 3 blue bars but later goes back to 1 blue bar. Is the battery not charging or is it losing battery?"
"Purchased the 4 channel 1600 watt version.  Ran it for a week just running my door speakers and worked flawlessly.  Easy to install, easy to tune and sounded good on my door speakers.<br /><br />Once I added a single 10&#34; subwoofer, the amp would go into protection mode.  Amp claims it is 2 ohm stable, but it is now.  I was running a single 10 with dual 4 ohm voice coils and when you have the volume up and the bass hits, the amp shuts down.<br /><br />Amp sounded good when it was running, but doesn't last very long.  Probably works great with subs in 4 ohm, but does not work in 2 ohms."
Most of us have probably been there before. You reach into your pocket to grab you phone and it takes off and goes for a tumble. Well we all learn our lesson eventually and need to find us a nice case to keep it safe.<br /><br />The Collen iPhone 6 case offers two layers of protection. The first is the silicone layer that covers the phone. The second is a hard plastic exterior to assist with drops and scratches and keep the silicone layer tightly in place. I do mean tightly. This is one of the tightest cases I have seen yet to have such a great fit.<br /><br />I love these sleek cases. They keep the iPhones footprint as small as possible to squeeze it into your pockets yet still add a nice protection to it.<br /><br />It also comes with a kick stand on the back to keep the iPhone upright will watching a video or such. That feature has won the approval of my son. This part worries me a little. Every time I have an item with a small plastic kick stand the plastic brace always seems to break off like it did on my iPad recently.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
"I've been using this phone for a few weeks now after switching off my Galaxy S3.  I loved the GS3 when it was new but it's been showing its age and slowing down tremendously.<br /><br />The LG G3 is a great successor.  It's mostly vanilla Android which is great but there are a few cool features I use a lot.<br /><br />1) double tap on the screen to turn on/off - love not having to feel around the back for the power button only to (inevitably) press on the camera lens (if there was any downside to the design, that would be it.  Circular power button just below the circular camera?  not smart, LG)<br />2) This was a one time setup thing, but using NFC to pull my settings and apps from my GS3 to the G3 was awesome and such a time saver.  Well done, Android!<br /><br />One more thing, I was looking at this phone over some of it's competitors mostly to get the best camera in an android phone and this does not disappoint.  It has taken crystal clear pictures.  I really like the camera interface and I like how I can use hand gestures to take the picture.  This makes taking a selfie with my baby to send to my wife a snap (HA! get it?)."
"Great radios.  I used them a couple of weeks ago when I went on a road trip and some offroading.  On open highway/freeway, you get around 3/4 to 1 mile line of sight range.  The radios have a loud, clear volume unlike the FRS radios that you can get.  I used them for hours without the batteries wearing down.  I bought the programming cord for them too but have not programmed them.  I have not used them indoors so I do not know how far they will transmit.<br /><br />If you have been looking for a really great set of 2 way radios, these are the ones to get."
love the case but its a little bit too hard to make it fit so on one side is not really fixed right
"Worked well at first but then seemed to have glitches.  Won't always charge when attempting, but when it does charge, it works as expected.  For the money, maybe worth it, as it is 1/4 the price of other products."
Great for the price! Easy to install. I've used the regular screen protectors on every iPhone I've have but I like this one way better.
This works great.  It charges both my iPhone 5 and iPad 4 very quickly and with no problems.
"I've had four pair. The sound is excellent, and they fit my ear (few earbuds do). The problem I've had with every one is that despite all my best efforts, they all eventually shorted out. The weakness is in the cord where it leaves the plug. Normal wear and tear bending will ruin it in a few months. I've managed to make them last up to 6-7 months by wrapping that part of the cord in electrical tape, but it looks like crap and eventually fails anyway. After two years and $160+ (I got one store to replace a set without charge), I'm ditching the brand and looking elsewhere. Such great sound and a solid fit, but if they can't manage to engineer a cord that doesn't break, it's an expensive and useless gadget."
"Just recieved it today , havent used it yet but seems like a good product that will do the job."
I just received it and haven't used it yet.  The bluetooth paired and works.  The design is great.  The phone fits really snug.  It appears that it will work well.  It is nice quality.
"Good price but no detail on the map. It only shows water and land - that's it!  No fathom lines, no buoys or channel markers, nothing.  The fish finders and side view work surprisingly well for the price.  Their main limitation is that the screen is small but that's part of the package so it's not really a complaint."
"Bought it for my wife and it seems to be a decent case, and she loves purple."
This is a very sturdy case for the iPhone 6.  It comes in 2 pieces...a black rubber case and then a pink (or whatever color you choose) plastic cover.  The case has port covers for the charging port and the silent button which will keep sand/crumbs/etc. out of the ports. I really like it.
"Overall nice case, protects the screen when it's in my pocket (mainly what I was looking for). My one complaint is the flap that holds the cover shut. The seam at the edge rubs against the phone every time you close it (that tension is what keeps it shut), and seems to be causing quite a bit of wear over a short time (just over a month as of writing), making me question just how long this case will last."
"Absoultely perfect. the included install guide makes this super easy to install. Comes with everything needed to install: clean, dry, guide, and holder.<br />A+++ I got this at a discount for my honest review but even full price is good price for the quality compared to other brands. All my comments and feedback are my own opinion.<br />Any questions I'll do my best to answer"
I have brought mine to the beach a few times and i feel a lot better about using it near sand and water
So far so good. Strong hold  bendable bar could be stiffer but it works good
Great product
I've had this case for about a month and it has been great so far! Really happy with this product.
"Perfect for charging 2 kindles, my Bose rechargeable headphones and my MP3 player simultaneously"
"Got this case a few months ago, It works great. The kickstand is also a plus!"
"This product is complete trash. I ordered this months ago and it still is not at my house and on my apple watch. I contacted the seller and I get all these BS excuses like &#34;oh to get you the best product we are going to take weeks on end to ship this to you&#34; this seller is Untrustworthy and incapable of making proper sales DO NOT BUY, there are better ones out there who's seller is capable of satisfying a consumer. Trust me SELLER IS GARBAGE AND PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
"Excellent.  It keeps all my electronics charged at all times.  I don't have to keep looking for AC outlets at the airport.  Furthermore, I heard that some public phone charging outlets may be stealing people's data when they plug in to charge."
Cheap both in price and in quality
I purchased this to hep me keep track of my steps but it has many additional benefits.  I highly recommend if you're that person that wants to be reminded not to get stuck at your desk too much or to do better about going to bed.
WAY too difficult figuring out how to use the product.  I've essentially abandoned the product and wrote it off as a failed experiment.
"Charger worked well while it lasted, after about a month of use it stops working and iPhone 6+ says the wire is not compatible with phone for charging..."
Worked much better than expected at this price. Especially the clear pictures with the macro lens are a delight!
"Worked decently well for the first couple months, but took too long to charge with solar power from the beginning. Seeing these other people say that it takes 3-4 hours to charge with solar power is shocking to me! Also, after three months of conservative use, one of the USB ports detached and completely came out with my USB cable. Thankfully it has two ports for a USB cable so I'm backed up. It charged my phone really well but these other shortcomings would prevent me from buying one of these again."
So much easier to hear on the iPhone using this. Nice find.
Great Product
This is my second purchase of this product. I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I accidently dropped my phone face down on concrete and several other times without anything cracking. The first break to this glass cover was a direct hit from the corner of a cement counter top. It hit the top edge and made a chip in the cover. I left it in place because it was minor damage and barely noticeable. This did compromise the integrity of the screen protector and I did get several more cracks in it over the next 3 months from more drops/bangs. I finally decided it had too many cracks and needed replaced so I bought another one. Installation is a breeze and the fit is great. I like how shiny it is. Much cheaper than repairing a phone or replacing the cracked screen. I highly recommend this product.
This cover is amazing. It lasted with for about a year and it protected the phone so much. Love it . Great for the price.
Works perfectly sounds great. However something I didn't know was that if you start to get static put your phone on airplane mode.
"My daughter is in love with her lil gadgets headset..we purchased the pink ones and had a little technical issues the second day of use, contacted lil gadgets and Jason was excellent in helping resolve the issue and best customer service I've experienced in a long time..unlike other customers the sound is perfect it works off my child's volumn controls..the fit is snug and perfect they can even fit my 8 years old head and go right back being snug on my 3 year old...I would recommend easily to anyone and actually plan on purchasing more for our other 3kids for our upcoming road trip.."
"Great Product, speedy delivery, NO PROBLEMS!"
The screen protector was very easy to apply.  If you don't have a good case it does lift if your rough with your phone. Overall it's a good product and I would purchase it again
"the rubber case it too big, so the outer shell &#34;hard case&#34; cannot be used with it.  It is a so-so design, truly not perfect."
"Beautiful concept, not at all practical though. The audio port is too narrow to fit any jack, considering drilling it out. The jigsaw like piece that fits the two halves together is flimsy in design and would be best glued together once you've committed to the case."
I can wear this all day.  Love the way this bluetooth fits!  This is my second one since I lost my first one.
Received this product for review. Great charger. I really like that it is 6 feet long. Its perfect for laying in bed if you don't have an outlet close to your bed. I noticed it seemed to charge faster than other cords that I have bought off of amazon. Overall I think this is a great prodcut!
Sleet and handsome design make this case a winner for all. Love the way if fit had no issues at all.
"Had the case for two days now and so far so good, it fits nice and snug on my S4 and though it may not be as sturdy as my OtterBox it is less bulky."
"4 stars and not 5 because the watch gets to my hands 16 days later but, its attached perfect with my iphone very good watch!!"
very pleased with this  product. i purchased this cover from a different company in pink. great protection and very durable
Holds a credit card and drivers license perfectly!  Seemed a little stiff to slide at first but once used a few times it is fine.
"This w=is a great case. It's clear but protects the phone well. Got a quick delivery, on Sunday even."
No appreciable increase in signal strength
It will protect your phone from numerous dangers and fits in your pocket easily. Easily recommend to a friend
It did not properly fit my phone.  The hole for the camera does not line up.  It also did not stick well and was removed after the first week.
"Clear image but four stars since you cant really set it on top of the dashboard as the image will be upside down when you review it.  It has to be mounted on the windshield for proper image view.  Bumped up to 4 since I actually use it, clear image, and has survived a month in the Texas summer heat and the vendor contacted me asking for a more favorable review  but my original intent was for it to be mounted on the dash, not the windshield and there is no setting to reverse the image."
This cell phone case is just perfect for the LG Ultimate 2.  The gold backing is good protection and looks elegant on the phone.  The black hard rubber case provides good protection and keeps the phone from slipping out of your hand.  I would buy this case again and highly recommend it.
"I never carry a purse any more - it's great!  This is my third one (for third phone upgrade), and except for the limited color selections I couldn't be happier."
I absolutely love my vivo fit 2. It makes me more mindful of the exercise I do during my day. I love seeing the calories I burn. Such an insentive.
I was concerned about this product being flimsy and poorly made just because of how thin it appeared to be. I was wrong! I've had it on my phone for a few months now and it is fantastic! They look so late and not oversized while being adorable at the same time. I purchased the black one and teal as well.
when i first received the case i thought it was cute but i have not even had this case for a week and the black on it is already fading. its a piece of junk.
It's charge 50% of the cell phone battery which it's good
"Love this phone case. I originally bought it to protect my phone while I found a more &#34;permanent&#34; case. But I ended up loving it so much, I never got another case. Slim and fits perfectly."
"The reading light arrived even sooner than expected, and works just fine. I had read a review that said it was too bright, but I didn't find that at all.  It even has two settings, both of which provide enough light.  I'm a little concerned that the expense of batteries will be a problem, but we'll have to see.  The light is on a wand that can be bent to any angle, so that is very good."
Sound quality is terrible and evidently the mic is too. People can't understand what I'm saying. Wish I could say it was worth the low price but it isn't. I give it two stars because technically it does do what is supposed to and pairs easily enough.
"I have had it quite a while and the image still looks great.  Though covered, I have not had any trouble using the buttons."
First off can I just say how well fit this case is? Btw this is an honest and unbiased review. It's as if it was made during the production of the iPhone 6 Plus! It does not add any bulk at all in my opinion. The volume buttons and sleep button are easy to push that's why I say the case is definitely well made for this phone. I also like how the inside is lined with felt to protect from scratches. The soft feel on outside of case is very smooth but not slippery. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who needs protection but don't want a bulky case.  Maxboost customer service:  They are excellent. Very professional and if you have a problem they will solve it right away. Customer service is very important which is why I gave five stars.
Belt clip broke already.  Sleeve that the phone slips in is very durable.
"The handle has already broke and it looks like good quality on line, but it very cheap plastic. It worked for a couple of weeks and the art is very cute, but not at all a good buy."
This is my second Otter Box I really like the way they hold up.
"Fit well and looks very nice.  It's very thin, so may not protect iPhone well, especially when it's dropped.  But I know it before I purchased it, so not complaining."
"product worked as advertised, easy installation. I was even able to remove the glass and reapply it to a new phone after a warranty replacement."
The case cracked easily whenever I would take it off. Its hard to access few letters when I was texting or trying to close out certain ads. The picture I would take was rather blurry
I just love the new new case . I would highly recommend it. The color is beautiful! Very sturdy but still streamlined.
"Pros:<br />-These work great for Quick Charge compliant chargers.<br />-Higher quality than most cheap USB cables. Sturdy. Faster charging from thicker gauge wire.<br />-Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None<br /><br />I have replaced all of my old cables with Aukey, Anker, and Tronsmart cables (same OEM) because they work so much better and last longer."
Great antenna. Perfect replace of stock antenna
So surprised by how good the sound is.  I was a little worried due to the low price but very happy with it and bought another one for my daughter.
"While I do love the quick charge 2.0 and the price is right....the only thing I do not like is the charging block, it's bulky and takes up at least 2 slots on my extension cord. Other than that, it's perfect"
So far it's still sticking. Gtmat seems to be made right. Price and quality. What more could I ask for
"Does the job nicely - keps the phone dry, and hangs around the neck while out on the kayak - bright enough to use as a signaling device if necessary. Well made."
I just got this item. It came within a couple days of ordering which is nice. It seems very durable! So far so good.
Amazing band. Great band for the apple watch sports space grey. Fits perfectly and looks great. One minus point was that it was very hard to resize even with the tools it came with. Recommend this though as its fairly cheap!
"I had been using another VERY popular case, but the plastic at the bottom kept breaking when i was pulling the phone out of my pocket.  This one is much more robust in the bottom, and has the same look, feel, and function as the other one except the back is plastic instead of the rubber.  My other case was wrapped in rubber with just a plastic ring around the edging.  This one is wrapped in rubber with a complete plastic backing and some on the sides.  It is much less prone to breaking.  Bonus, my phone actually looks like an iPhone with this case too.  haha  I am happy."
"Big fan of this case - so much so that we've ordered 3; just because the plastic screen gets scratched from use. I've dropped my phone from my lifted jeep with this case and it was totally fine. I like it because it's very light weight and compact but protects as well, if not better, as an Otterbox case. We'll continue to order this case as long as it's available."
Does exactly what it advertised.  Plugs into my Jabra Pro headset base and turns on when I remove the headset from the base.  I work from my home do people can know not to walk into my office when I'm on a call.
"It took one week before it started to short out at the phone end. You could send us another cord and i'll see of that was a fluke, otherwise, I will look into sending it back."
"For the price, it is well worth it. I've only used this for a few weeks, but I haven't had any problems. The size of the &#34;encasement&#34; over the base of the plug is small enough to fit my iPhone, which is protected by a bumper. This is a huge plus, since cables of other brands, e.g., Belkin, are not as conservative when it comes to the size of the adapter end. I also appreciate that the cable is more rigid than conventional cables, i.e., it doesn't get twisted and caught up in stuff when I'm moving my iPhone around on my desk or in my car. This is a minor point, but with typical cables it is as irritating as wrapping up a garden hose. Unless something negative happens in the future, I would definitely buy this product again."
I love my little cardbuddy. It's easy to apply and very convenient. All my friends want one now too. I just wish it was black to match my case but other than that I'm very satisfied with it.
Great for my purpose.  I have a Harley Road Glide.  I don't need a very long cable to plug it into my motorcycle so it works perfectly!  I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you are in the market for a short lightning cable.
"Bought two of these, one for each car - I love that I have so many options and that it securely holds my Note 4 with a heavy duty case!  One of the vent clips did break about a week after Amazon's return window was up...contacted the company and received a replacement part in less than a week with no hassle of having to send anything back."
"The product works very well. however, after having it for nearly a month, the iPhone input cuts in and out during charging. in doing so, I have to tilt the iPhone a specific way so that it charges.<br /><br />6.5/10. would recommend, but needs some adjusting."
Works as advertised but it does not accomodate very large batteries like the Posh 7&#34; phone has.  Very good deal for the $5 tag.
"I've had this watch for a little over a month now, and let me say this thing is awesome. Android Wear allows me to easily view my notifications and respond to texts without having to pull my phone out, and when its raining, thats a very nifty thing. setting reminders is super quick and simple, as well as setting things like timers and alarms.<br />The battery gets me all the way through the day (I haven't tried the ambient settings as the &#34;lift to turn on&#34; works just fine for me), and I can charge it while i'm in the shower before I go to bed so I can use it with Sleep as Android to track my sleeping habits. the cradle charges the watch really quickly too which is very nice.<br />i've more than once accidentally scraped the glass on something, but have yet to have any scratches on any part of the watch.<br />the screen has a great set of brightness levels and is still mostly readable in direct sun, although not as easy as traditional watches<br /><br />the only con here I have, would be the leather strap. I love the grey color, and it feels pretty great, but if I sweat or get it wet it tends to leave a slight discoloring on my wrist which washes away with a good scrubbing. also, the leather strap soaks up sweat and smells pretty nasty. I would certainly suggest buying a metal watch strap from your local jeweler or online. Because they made it use the standard watch strap size so its easy to find an alternative, i'm not dropping a star for this very minuscule issue"
LOVED IT
Finding the charge location is kind of a pain in the butt on the phones that you have and always having to push a button to get it to start charging is frustrating as well but it works
"This cable works better than my wall charger.<br /><br />Once the cable gets plugged into the car charger, it's very hard to get out. I don't mean it's impossible. I mean to say it's PRETTY FIRM<br /><br />The material itself is plastic. It looks like any other charger but once you plug everything, you feel the difference. It's worth of your money.<br /><br />Also, if you get the cable and connect to your wall charger, it's gonna work just as fine"
"Ok, yes, it's cheap in price. What it isn't though, is cheap in quality. I read the reviews of this mount and several others before deciding to trust a reviewer who said he used this in his jeep off-roading. It does exactly as it says. It holds onto that phone and doesn't move or drop it. There are wheels for adjusting the angle and grip. You can use the sticky adhesive or you can use the suction cup. I use the suction cup and it's never moved from my dash. Granted I don't drive off road but I feel it would still hold onto my iPhone. I don't think it can fit an iPhone 6 Plus in a thick case but then again I didn't try that."
great product!  Keeps the charge for a long time and the sound quality is great.  Highly recommend!
Fits phone great but the loop in breaks. I have gone though three. They last for about 4 or 5 months.
"Awesome case I like it it makes the phone a little heavier but other than that is great. Looks good, protects the phone well, fits perfectly I do recommend"
It does not provide enough power for iPad. I am disappointed
"Already my favorite speaker. It's easy to use, can be taken practically anywhere, and has awesome sound quality for its size. It beats out any other device in my home for streaming music. The rubber band on the sides can be annoying since it pulls away from the speaker at the edges and NudeAudio's customer support leaves a lot to be desired when communicating with them, but overall the speaker itself is pretty awesome."
Nice quality but as others mentioned the top of the clip digs into your side and is uncomfortable. I find myself not using it because of this.
This is a fun case.  It's like have a wallet with you.
No more blue tooth for us!  This is better for your health and works great!
"After 1 month of use, it's reacting very slow. Also observed sound is very low while talking on the phone. And now people are complaining that they are unable to here my voice properly. Oh my god it's sucking....."
The case arrived later than expected. I really like that the case is sleek and not too bulky but the rubberized part is so stiff that it makes it almost impossible to press any of the phones buttons.
"My phone is older and I could not find a case for it at the mall or the T Mobile store.  I found this case online, and it fits perfectly and I love the little kickstand that allows me to stand my phone on a flat surface to read/watch something online.  The screen saver was not sticky enough to adhere to the phone, though, so I had to throw it out.  Love the case, though."
It's a factory battery.  Better work right ;)
The seller did exactly what they said they would. I have already dropped my phone on concrete since I have had this case and it protected it like it should.
"Great case, looks nice and protects my phone really well. The rubber used feels soft and doesn't get dirty easily like other rubber cases."
Great alternative to the very pricey Apple version. I have had it for a few weeks now and I love it. Easy to adjust to fit and works great when at the gym.
Jawbone gave me this to replace my two UP24s that they replaced every 6 months as they kept breaking. UP2 just doesn't work or do the job it's supposed to do. It doesn't stay on the wrist. It is now lost. It also doesn't track steps or sleep all the time. Just when it chose too.
"It is of high quality but it suffers from the same issue as all the other Note 5 tempered glass screen protectors I have tried so far: halo effect. The edges all along the screen protector do not adhere to the display and are lifted, creating a bubble, or &#34;halo&#34;, effect."
"This product will not work if the vehicle is a manual transmission, it is in the way of the gear shifter."
"Worked perfectly, when I used the charging cord that came with it. That cord is quite short, so I tried using another mini USB, but it did not charge correctly.<br />However, during long days, this adds the charge I need and does it well."
"Arrived as promised, love it, great case and the shatter proof glass worked great, real easy to apply!"
"These headphones were a great purchase.  I have small ears and few headphones of this style fit me well.  These have a lot of accessory pieces that helped get it properly sized.  They stay snugly fit, no matter the activity level. They also have a better range than I anticipated."
Good phone case. Easy to put together and take apart. Easy cleaning.
"The first thing I want to mention is that this review is not for the above mentioned device but it is for the other Argon rectangle shaped speaker. The one I am reviewing is this…<br />Argon® Bluetooth Wireless Portable Stereo 2CH Speaker for all iPhone, iPod, iPad, Blackberry, Android smartphones and MP3 players. Rechargeable built-in battery [Red]<br /><br />Due to some amazon goofup, I received this rectangle speaker.<br />I love having a bluetooth speaker around which we can use say inside the car or even at home. Or when you go to beach or someplace. The argon speaker we are talking about here is a rectangular shaped bluetooth portable 2 channel speaker. The reason it is mentioned 2 Channel is because it internally has 2 small speakers and both provide a maximum output of 3W RMS per speaker. If you buy a single speaker like those circular or cube shaped ones, they usually have single 3W speaker inside, while this has 2. This way you can achieve stereo sound quality.<br /><br />If you look at the body of the speaker, it will look like small and big sized blocks arranged in some fashion. On top of the speaker, you have 3 buttons for telephone, plus and minus.<br />On the front of the speaker is the same pattern but you have a mesh sort of design with “Argon” logo on the left side. On the very right bottom is the LED light which is visible only when you are charging the speaker or it is turned on. It will turn red when you are charging it and turn blue once fully charged. When paired, it will blink blue light.<br /><br />The 3 buttons on the top of the speakers are for..<br />--Volume Up and Down<br />--Track Next and Previous<br />--Music Pause / Lift Call / Hangup<br /><br />Yes the same buttons have multiple functions. When you are playing music, if you press the volume buttons once and rapidly, it will increase or decrease the volume. While if you keep it pressed, it will change the track. The middle button with handset embossing is used for pausing themusic. When in a call, it is used to hangup the call.<br /><br />On the right side of the speaker is the charging port which is MicroUSB Connector. You have a Aux In available as well so you could connect a 3.5mm connector and use the bluetooth speaker as a non bluetooth one. There is a ON/OFF Switch as well. When you turn on the speaker, it will “speak” to you. Yes it says “Hello”. This may freak people initially. There is no tone etc, it will speak stuff. Like when pairing is done, it will say “You phone is now connected” and such.<br /><br />The volume of the speaker is independent to the volume of the device connected. This means that you can have very loud sound. The sound from the speaker is pretty decent and people should look at the price and set their expectations. Don’t expect a LG UE Boombox or Bose level sound here. For casual listening it is pretty good. The bass is Ok but many a times I felt that sound was tearing especially at higher volume. Overall I would rate ⅘ on the sound quality.<br /><br />The speaker will be shown as “Argon SP28” on your phone etc. Also I don’t know why but on my iPhone, I could not get the battery level display on the status bar. This usually works with most battery operated bluetooth speakers. These have 1000mAh battery inside it which is pretty good and manufacturer claim is around 9 Hours of battery but I am sure that is at a decent volume and not full blast.<br /><br />Inside the box you are will get the MicroUSB cable and 3.5mm cable. Overall decent enough speakers for the price and deliver a good value.<br />*I received this product in exchange of a honest and unbiased feedback and all opinions are based on my usage with the product."
"Replaced my aging and unreliable GO PRO 2 with the Virb.  Didn't want to spend $400 on a new &#34;HERO&#34;.  Use it primarily for motorcycle track days.  It takes excellent video, and it is tough.  Unfortunately I crash tested it last month and it still works great.  Check out Youtube, type in<br /> creepy 847, and find JimC crash."
"Really disappointed in this case. Its a cute case but the gold part kept slipping off. I only had it for about 1 week before it fell and I didn't realize it and lost the part. So this case had to go right in the trash can. I wish it would have fit the phone better. I'm disappointed that I wasted $15 for a cute case that I couldn't use anymore because the case size was wrong. And yes, I did order the right case for my phone. The length fit but the width didn't. The gold part barely clicked into place with the teal part when it arrived."
"Nice, thin, grippy case for iPhone, makes it a lot easier to hold and protects it from scratches and hard falls. But dust and dirt get under it pretty easily, so your phone doesn't look great."
The ONLY tool you need to worry about is the thin wire to remove your broken screen.... two were included and both broke multiple times... if I heated my phone to the surface temperature of the sun they may have worked. I broke my digitizer trying...
"This device would have gotten 5 stars had the following not happened:<br /><br />1) They shipped the device 4 weeks after they said they would.<br />2) The directions on how to link the device are horribly incomplete (this should be simple... it's bluetooth).  And tthere wasn't any further information on their website describing how to get it to link to iPhone nor was anyone fielding tech support questions on their &#34;launch weekend&#34;.<br /><br />Get this, I found the answer on Amazon in user comments.<br /><br />They have a very cool product, but come on... it is simple to make useful FAQs and have someone respond to user questions on the weekend... especially the weekend you release your new product."
the material is really cheap and the head phones hardly stay in the little magnet that it has to hold on. it work great just that when you put it on speaker the other person can't hear me whit the headphones which makes it difficult when i drive.
"Love my new OtterBox for my Galaxy s5 phone, its sturdy, with a clip on on the back, n has a locking system on it that locks into place . Awesome prouduct , OtterBox is the only case you will ever need."
"I'm usually a big fan of skinomi products, but it seems like this time around, the tech glass wasn't that great. Very clear and feels nice when using the screen, but a little after week of use I found a slight cut on the protector. Hadn't been dropped so I guess something scratched it somehow."
"I love the charging base, it is comfortable to wear. However it drops the bluetooth connection after about 15 minutes of being on a call. I know it's not my phone (Galaxy Note 4 running Kit Kat) my other headset stays connected. I got this to stay at the office and use on frequent long conference calls. Wish I kept the packaging to send it back.  UPDATE: I was sent a new headset without requesting a replacement, this one works great so I obviously had a defective one. Comfortable to wear all day and the battery makes it through the day as well even with marathon conference calls."
It works quite well. An awesome product.
I wasn't expecting a PAL charger with a separate adapter; otherwise it was a great purchase.
Like the price and it fits but it's not charging.  I assume it's my phone but I'm gonna wait before I decide  to toss it.
These screen protectors look good but they don't fit the Fire phone exactly correct and cause issues with the phone screen. They look like they should work but with all of the camera sensors on the face of the phone they just don't work. Save your money. They look as good as any screen protector they just don't work on this phone.
"absolute junk.  The gripper/jaw clip thing is loose and when it actually holds your phone, it  presses into the volume keys and messes with audio.  Really crappy design and not useful at all for iPhones."
"Works great, will provide excellent support to the Heil Broadcast boom which is big!"
wORKING FINE!  I AM HAPPY WITH IT.
"Originally I believed this to be a good strong product.  It seemed durable and was easily attached to phone.  However, after only 1 month, the first crack in the protector appeared.  The edges started to crack as it does not  cover the whole screen of my Iphone 6 and I now have 2 other cracks.  I have ordered a replacement and will see how it does."
"I'm giving this product a 2 because it looks great and my son loved it, but it broke in 3-days.....😏 i guess a part on the side cracked & kept getting caught going in and out his pocket!  So not a good buy😔😢 toobad because we luv the Giants!!"
It didn't work after the first use. The battery power bank just heated up to the point that I thought it would burn my hand when I touched it.  For $5 I figured it was worth a try.
"I received this product with a great discount for an honest review.<br /><br />Easy to connect to my laptop and my cell phone, I was really happy with the range on these headphones. I was able to walk around almost my entire bungalow and listen to the radio streaming on the laptop.<br /><br />I did have some difficulty getting the headphones to seat in one of my ears. The device comes with several different sizing options but for whatever reason, I ended up irritating my ear before finding the optimal angle.<br /><br />The charge was quick, and lasted long enough for my cleaning session (or for a workout), and I think these are an excellent choice for bluetooth headphones intended for use for limited lengths of time."
"Great, just what I needed and worked without any issues.  This item is exactly what you need if you have an Otterbox type case on your iPhone and need an extension to into the phone for charging, especially for those chargers that have the big square ends on them."
Fit my Motorola Droid Razar M Well.......Good cover for the price. I will probably order another one in a different color.
"Excellent product, product waterproof and it protects my phone when i  saw the rain. Take pictures, receive and call anytime. I no longer worry about my phone when it rains. Because, i have waterproof. Thank to seller so much!"
A nice slim cover for the price.  I haven't damaged my iPhone 6plus yet and really don't expect to with this simple and clean phone cover.
Great product with nice features.  Looks 100% like original radio  in my dad's 66 novel with some updated technology.
"I have dropped my phone shortly after I purchased this screen- it cracked into multiple pieces, but the most disturbing fact was that my iPhone 6 screen cracked even more beneath it!!!"
"Works great with the HTC M8, iphone 6+, 5s, and ipad mini.  Plugs in smooth into the cigarette lighter adapter and stays in place."
"Just got the free samples before four days.AWSOME case ! Really works.I am very pleased with this waterproof case! I cut paper towels to fit exactly to each corner and I dunked it in a jug of water with a weight on top for 1/2 hour. When I took it out the paper towels were completely dry! It comes with a lanyard to wear around your neck or attach to beach bag or whatever.<br /><br />Good for the three layers lock seal,it is very safety.I found this case to be amazing made of high quality materials and it holds many items perfectly ,it fit my phone perfectly and I was able to add cash and my debit card to it<br />It went to the beach and the pool -- never underwater because that is just not part of my lifestyle. With lots of splashing and normal exposure to that environment, my phone stayed dry. For me, that is the ultimate test, and it passed! Sample provided and I am well pleased.Highly recommended!"
I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 56 to take on my next vacation flight to Florida so I thought that a case that was the exact size as the screen would be good.  Regretfully the Garmin nuvi I will not be taking it with me on any trip therefore the case is useless to me.  The problem with the case is that it does not provide space for the auto power cord therefore the value is iffy.
I LOVE THIS CASE! I get so much use out of it and all of my friends love it and think its so funny. It fits the ipod perfectly . I love it
I got this for my husband to use at work so he can always have his phone handy.  He loves that he can access his phone whenever he needs it and does not have to fumble with taking it out and putting it back anywhere.  It also makes it easier for him when listening to music to switch between songs and control the volume or whatever he may need.  It fit perfectly around his wrist and does not bother him at all nor does it get in the way while he is working.  It is made of a very nice soft material and has not caused any kind of irritation on the skin.  It is also something that can be used easily if you go to the gym or like going for walks and want to carry a key or something similar with you as it has a storage pocket for such items.  We purchased this item at a discount for our honest unbiased review.
"It broke after one month of use. Very generic plastic. I thought the RCA brand would have been better quality, but it turns out this branding is inked on cheap plastic.  Very disappointed."
Works. I dropped it like 20 times already and it really protects your screen. I just wish I got the all black color
"Very quick delivery, after initial charge it seemed to lose its battery faster than I thought while a co-worker charged her phone. Looking forward to the backup power tho!"
"They are really comfortable for running and the shape does give it more strength over the ear so it does work great for sports. The only thing Im not so sure about, is the shape of the earphone it self. It feels funny and doesnt really sit tightly inside my ears as I hope it would. This makes the sound kind of strange every once in a while, but you get used to it."
"After  Researching for the right case I decided on this one and it was perfect.  So glad I c hose this company after reading their reviews. Definitely would buy from them again, Thanks"
"Solid construction. Had a problem sliding the case open to use the phone in hot weather - very difficult to slide.<br />As a result, I purchased another case of a different type."
Perfect fit for my iPhone5s
"This product worked good for about a week, and then it stopped working, I guess you get what you pay for!!! Save your money"
Small but okay.some memory should come with it.the picture quality is not that good.fast shipping
"Received very quickly, love suppliers who can deliver!  Does what it says, but knocked down a bit because of the disappointment finding out the phone needs to be placed on it pretty precisely in order for it to start charging (using Nexus 6).  Thought it would be a lot more convenient to simply place the phone right on top of it and that would be it but seems like there is a fair amount of slightly moving the phone around each time to find the &#34;sweet spot&#34; in order for it to start charging.  Tried without cases on, with, didn't matter.  -Edit to note that after using for a little while muscle memory begins to kick in and seems a lot easier now to place the phone on there lined up correctly so a bit of a learning curve in the beginning is all.  Charges fairly fast but compared to the Quick Charge cord provided by Motorola with the Nexus 6 it can't compare but not a huge deal for me, just an FYI for others."
I put it on and haven't regretted it.  It does make the watch larger and beefier looking.  The only thing I didn't like was that the screen protector leaves a small gap of 2-3mm between the screen protector and the outer ring of protection.  No problems installing it
"Can't beat these for the price. I've had them all. Sounds great off of the my pioneer 6700. I'm sure they would sound even better with an amp. If you were to spend money on an amp, do it right. Don't skimp if you want quality audio."
"One of the best Alpine I have ever owned.  My only concern is the sound adjustment needs a little more tweeking.  On my old Alpine, I could pick the frequency, and the MX was easier to turn on and off.  Other than that, this stereo is great.  It went in easy, and with all the necessary hardware. I love the Blu tooth capability, and especially the ability to play music without having a jack to connect to, even though it comes with both a jack and a USB port.  I would buy this all over again if I had to..."
"This the second one I bought.  Great price for a great product, if only I would stop losing them!"
Love this case. It's solid and the back is sticky enough to use the case as advertised without also acting as a dir magnet. Some nits kf ljnt etc stick but nothing major. The back and sides offer a nice rubbery feeling in hand as well.
"Enjoy using it, only think it doesn't seem to work on iPad with FaceTime. Works with movies and use<br />It outside to listen to radio station."
"should have read it other reviews before buying. It keeps falling off and finally I lost one. Now I cannot return it as well.<br />Other than that, it was OK. It is not hard plastic, it is soft rubber band and somewhat protects the watch from minor bumps. I had black one and it wasn't looking bad on watch although it hides the shining side surface of the watch."
"They're okay cords.  Really great price and nice colors, but much of the time they don't work when charging my iPhone or iPad."
"I got this case in Turquoise Mint and I love it! I have had quite a few Caseology cases and they never seem to let me down.<br /><br />This case fits nice and snug and while it feels sturdy and protected, it doesn't add a lot of weight or bulk to the phone. The material is like a thick TPU and it is VERY smooth to touch. The color is vibrant and beautiful.<br /><br />I took one star off because the case needs to be slightly altered for the Verizon version of the Note 4. This is actually a common problem with the Verizon phones, the mic hole to the left of the charger port is about 1/4 inch farther away than it is on the other carrier models. This is due to the different chipset that Verizon uses over AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. But it is an easy enough fix so you can get around it.<br /><br />All in all, I'd highly recommend this case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. However your own opinion might vary. I received no monitory compensation and not required to give a good review. This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions Guidelines on Testimony and Advertising."
"Very handy piece of equipment for those of us that are in our cars a lot.  It's a bit top heavy so the connection does come and go a little bit.  None the less, glad I bought it."
I had this professionally installed. As soon I played the first song it sounded like the voice coil was blown. I've messed around with the different levels so much and it still sounds like complete sh*t. Such a waste of money. Hundreds of dollars spent on this just to be used for a month then disconnected and put away in a closet.
This is our 2nd purchase of this charger.  My husband wanted one for his car too!  It does have a tightly coiled cord so you can't really talk easily while driving but we use blu tooth anyway.  We always double check that it is pushed all the way in every time we hook our phone up to the charger to make sure it is plugged in.  It does have a red indicator light to let you know that it is all set.
"Great phone case, it fits nice and snug, true to its words, waterproof shock proof. My only problem is that it seems to be not tough enough for a Marine. I dropped it so many times the from cover is falling off the stand broke off and a corner of the case broke off, still sick and water proof but unsure if I want to test it, I bought another one because I am sure the next one is to last longer. Great case for a great price, just not intense work environment"
Great case especially for a teen who drops phone a lot. This is  new one for iPhone 6. Looks great and price / shipping were excellent
the battery lasts 4 hours
"Wrong screwdrivers, we need a T1. No point in ordering this package."
"I like the concept, to have a full cover and a small space for your money and a few cards.  This only took a few days to arrive.  I was a little bit disappointed in the quality, it;s good, but not great...but for the price, it's not a bad deal."
"Like other reviewers have said, the protector does not fully stick to the phone and leaves a ring around the edges. It makes the phone look cheap. The top right of the protector has also been coming off since I put it on and leaves a large bubble."
"This armband is perfect.  I can fit my iPhone 6 in there without having to remove it from the case (unlike other armbands I've tried).  The material is flexible enough to be able to use the buttons from outside, and the clear front still allows me to use the touch screen.  The band is not constrictive when I workout, yet it holds the phone in place perfectly.  I wash it by hand in cool water.  I use the belt to hold my key fob and my sunglasses at the gym."
"High end is tinny and distorted, likely a side effect of Bluetooth audio compression.<br />When running better quality audio through the AUX input, the sound quality improves dramatically.<br />However, the speaker just does NOT get loud enough.<br />The rubber texture picks up and holds on to dust and dirt.<br /><br />Got mine on sale at a box store for $40, and returned it the next day. Certainly would NOT pay $100 for it."
I've tried many cases. This is by far the most durable and best case.
Works great. Would give 5 star for customer service!
It says it charges windows 1020 it don't says it charges iPhone 4s it don't says it charges samsung s5 it don't ...so I tried a older phone I had I don't use cause the screen is cracked it's a Nokia 900 hey that worked completely useless to me it charges none of the 4 phones in the house ...
Easiest repair I ever did. No instructions needed.
Great Phone definitely worth the price and a nice screen size
"The other reviews are SHILLS. Check the favorable reviews: They were compensated for a good review. This item would not hold my phone for any longer than 60 seconds, and then it would fall off. I can just imagine how many people bought this expecting it to hold their phones up only to have them fall down, fall out of the car, and hit the concrete and shatter.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
The RavPower USB charger is very good & works as advertised and I am very satisfied with it.<br />Venkatesh
Not pleased with this purchase. Comes with two protectors and first one the punch outs weren't aligned properly and would needed to be put on phone crooked. Second one lined up good. Bubbles were minimal and easy to remove. My problem was that it left a blurry look to the screen. Expected from a film protector I suppose. Rubbed nail on protector lightly to remove last bubble after other methods didn't work and it ripped right through. Customer service was good though for replacement.
I got this charge for my desk and it works just like the one that came in the box with my phone. Plus it came with an extra cord.
"Be careful when ordering, there is no way this cover fits the s6 edge, it about 3/4 the size and will not stretch"
"this product does not work, it is awful!!!  ... water damage to iPhone 5S ...  life proof does not stand behind its product ..."
It definitely protects the phone. I've dropped it a few times and it's still safe. It does block the front camera a little though.
Does this case have screen protection?like a plastic membrane or just the raised lip protection?
"I was sent a review copy of this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I have thoroughly tested the product to the best of my ability before posting this review.<br /><br />The I6 Cable(TM) lightning cable is a very good alternative to the genuine Apple lightning cable, and it's value for money makes it far superior than most alternatives on Amazon.<br /><br />From Apple, the lightning cable costs $19 and will probably last you around six months before the plastic wrap begins to peel. A very common issue amongst Apple users - just check any social network!<br /><br />The extra length means you can actually use the phone while it is charging.<br /><br />This lightning cable is wrapped in a slightly thicker and more durable plastic which will hopefully last longer and prevent it from tearing and ripping around the lightning connector area.<br /><br />you won't get an error message saying 'This accessory is not compatible with iPhone' when you plug it in. This is usually the case for a lot of cheaper.<br /><br />I can also confirm this works flawlessly with my iPad Air, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. It's also good to see that I6 Cable(TM) have confidence that their product will last longer than the Apple equivalent, which is why it comes with an 12-month warranty! I'll surely be updating this review in 12 months time.<br /><br />An improvement that could be made to the I6 Cable(TM) lightning cable is that it could be wrapped in Nylon rather than plastic. There are other products out there that use a Nylon cable over a plastic one simply because it is so much more durable and can withstand a lot of abuse. I currently use a Nylon-wrapped lightning cable and it has lasted me over 8 months already without a single sign of wear. It will be interesting to see how this one holds out comparatively."
This is an awesome case. Everything that is said on their website is true about it I especially love the feel and how slim it is.  Great Product looking forward to my next purchase and color.  They should offer a red case as well just a thought.
I received my order in just a few days. I'm so happy now I don't have to charge my phone everytime I turn around.
Recvd on time . Reception good most of the time. Audio on other end said to be faint.
I like the slim look and feel. Feels durable and fits the phone perfectly. I would order from them again.
I've had this case on my phone for over two years and it has worked splendidly. It has yet to let my phone suffer any damage and I drop it all the time. Such a great case for the price.
"No access to Mute key. Completely covers ear speaker and lower speakers causing low volume and muffled sound. Description says &#34;access to all buttons&#34; then later says &#34;except mute key&#34; it's quite deceiving. I've only had this for one day, it fell from the floor board of my LOW car to the pavement, and the lanyard holder broke in half. I really don't know how this has had a 5 star rating up until now. It is very low quality, especially for the price."
"This is a very compact selfie stick and feels good in your hand.  The quality seems good for the price and I think it should hold up nicely.  I wanted a hard wire shutter version because I don't want to worry about if it's charged when I want to use it.  However, only time will tell if the wire connection at the head will hold up over time.  Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend."
Many uses! Like it a lot.
These are great little speakers. Bluetooth connectivity is easy on both my phone and laptop. The sound is amazing for the size of the speaker with good bass response.<br /><br />Phone calls can be routed through with ease and the built in microphone is adequate. Very portable and with a decent battery life and good recharge time. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this and several of my friends have bought one after hearing mine. At this price you can't afford not to.
This case fit my Moto E LTE perfectly.  Absolutely love the look and feel of it.
This mounting system is fast and lightweight. I was nervous our how reliable this product would be. After watching a few youtube videos of actual testing I felt comfortable buying it. Glad I bought it. I used it for an ipod touch and it is supported very well. It just made it across Wisconsin without giving me an issue.
The Edge 200 works well.  I have had issues a few times getting it to find a GPS signal.  In those cases I have to power it off and on to get it working.  Other than that issue it has worked very well.  The only downside is that it tells me how far off I was on my mileage estimation before.  :(
It's absurd that Amazon is selling this item.  It speaks in Chinese and there's no information on how to change the language.
"The Seedan Lovely Cat Gel Back Case for Samsung is adorable and of a high quality material. It is, however, a thinner gel case and will not provide the highest level of cushion should the phone be dropped.  One issue I saw was that the openings cut for the charger, volume, etc. are just ever so slightly off.. In my opinion, the case is great for occasional use but, due to the inconsistencies in the placement of the openings, may not be be best for everyone."
These are great. I'm a field service tech and drive everywhere for work. I love the face you can place these anywhere on your dash or windshield.  This fits my iPhone6 (not iPhone6 plus) great while using phone for gps. It works so well that I purchased one for my wife and her Samsung S5 fits it as well and she really likes the iOttie.
"i have bought several sets of headphones in the $12-$70<br />these are by far the best sounding and absolutely the best value of all that i have tried.<br />they have the best bass response of all of them, and even sound better than many of my corded units."
Have received nothing but compliments on the color.  It has protected my phone several times when it was dropped.
"IF YOU HAVE 2012 AND NEWER MACS- DO NOT BUY. THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE. AFTER RESEARCHING AND CALLING APPLE SUPPORT- I FOUND OUT THIS DOESNT WORK ON NEW MACS BECUASE THEY DO NOT COME W/ INFARED .....<br /><br />YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANY APP AND USE IT TO PLAY MUSIC, NETFLIX, HULU, ETC. I DOWNLOADED HIPPO LITE AND IT WORKS JUST FINE.<br /><br />HAD TO RETURN AND GOT A REFUND"
"A tad bulky (compared to other chargers) but carries much more power and works just as claimed.  NOTE: charged phones, Nooks, and lots of other devices just fine.  Would NOT charge an Asus tablet, but the Asus tablet is a pig."
"I like the slim design and able to get almost three full charges for my S6, as long as I don't use it at the same time.  When I charge the device it doesn't indicate it has a full charge light...always one light bar...so I never know how much I have left.  Otherwise, it's a good product."
"It is great not to have to charge my phone every day, or have a low battery half way through the day of heavy use. Fits perfectly on my Samsung S4."
Incredible!  This is one of the best stylus's I've used.  My ipad responds very fast.
Worst case ever! Not only did it not fit or connect you also couldn't charge the phone with the case on.  Basically I just caught 17 bucks on fire for no reason... disappointed!
"Light weight, quality, and durable. A great value!"
"Damn, why Cant they just be a little cheaper. I am very picky with my money, but I used these with the Comply Foam Ear Tips and I was blown away how great they sound. I don't even play with the ear hooks/wings/ whatever everyone wants to call them. I don't have too. with the Comply Foam tips, you get an incredible seal that blocks out the World around you and When using the right size, you can workout and run and jump and head bang knowing your headphones will not be falling out. I love the hardshell case in comparison to the cheap bags that everyone else provides, the bags protect from scratches and nothing more, the case that come with these, will protect your investment. They are as portable as you can get without purchasing the EARIN. Bottom line, all customers would appreciate a lower price on any and every item, but these are honestly worth the money as long as they are durable enough. only time will tell that tale."
"The product and shipping ammenities were fine.  When I applied the screen, it took quite a while for the air bubbles to disappear (the instructions said a few days; it took a few weeks).  The screen also seems to smudge very easily via fingerprints and stylus use. I have to wipe off the screen with a microfibre cloth once every few hours, or it will start to build up and look rather nasty.  Edit: I was sent another one, and this time the air bubbles disappeared quicker than last time.  Still, it smudges really badly and has fingerprints everywhere. One of the pictures shows that it doesn't have any, but that's obviously not the case."
"Works better then I even hoped for.  Dealer wanted $450.00 to replace the the Bluetooth module on my 2006 Acura TL.  This cost me $50.00 and works perfectly, It's voice control and crystal clear.  The only negative but it is not the Jabra fault, before engaging the Jabra you will have to turn down your music yourself.  But saving $400.00 is well worth that one little drawback."
This is a great case. It fits the phone well and the magnet keeps the cover in place with no difficulty. It gives reasonable protection against a fall and keeps both sides of the phone safe from scratches. Looks nice too.
By far the best screen protector I've ever used. Very easy to install. No bubbles. All 4 corners are secure. No issues whatsoever.
"I have had fm transmitters before, and I was aware going into this purchase that reception can be sketchy, and you usually have to have the thing sitting just right.  When I got this unit I was very pleased with it's ease of use, variety of features, and for being an fm transmitter the reception I was getting from it wasn't too bad. It was definitely tolerable. This was my cheap solution for modernizing my truck without tearing into the dash to install a custom unit. Can't beat it for the price.  Oh, but fyi... It's pretty bad when being used for speakerphone. I tried it once, and the other person couldn't even hear me. I use a different unit for phone calls. This unit works well doing just about everything else it advertised."
Once u take the film off so u can attach one side to the phone the protector bends and does not want to fit to the phone. Lifts on all sides. Not a good quality...
The best product on Amazon.  We took this for our phones on our cruise.  We took snorkeling photos with our phone and not a drop inside the bag.  I tell everyone about this.
Can't really find a place on the steering wheel where you can secure it and have range of motion of the wheel
"Charges my android galaxy note 3 super fast. Fastest i've seen for any charger. Great feel, nice smooth color. very happy."
"A very convenient item. The con is that it does not come with a USB-to-MicroUSB adapters, so I had to spend additional money in order to purchase that."
Now it solved my problem of selfie or asking strangers to use my phone which was un-safe from get go.<br /><br />Easy to setup and now I go everywhere with this selfie stick.<br /><br />I plan to buy for gifting to some close friends.
"Bought an iPad and saved $100 by getting the WiFi only model.  Only to realize there is no GPS on these.  So, bought this for GPS routing.  Works great and works great in an airplane as well.  Sit it near the window and your tracking your plane.  Standalone, you can use it to plot a route on a Polaris or other ATV.  I download the route and then overlay it on to a map."
"I purchased this sub and box new off ebay mainly for the low profile. Fit perfectly behind the rear seats of my tundra crew max. Hooked it up to my Alpine 230w amp that was originally powering the component speakers.  The sub was blown after 3 weeks of use. Disappointed since I  never experienced the full potential of the sub. I always allow at least 1 month of break in before running the rated RMS wattage, or turning off the LPF. Replacing with pioneer shallow mount, same enclosure with slight reinforcements made. Much better"
"I bought this to take on a recent trip to Costa Rica. It protected my iPhone 6 just fine, but was a little snug with the case on. I recommend taking the case off of your phone before using this waterproof case. Very durable, seals out any sand and water that could damage the phone. The plastic is very high-quality and didn't interfere with the quality of pictures, which was my main concern. I would recommend this product to a friend."
"says it has magnetic closure, it does not !  and Gmyle says it does not come with magnetic closure,so if you want the cover to stay closed don't buy this one."
This is not at all a case worth for iPhone. The first day itself the plastic coating started peeling off. I had a spigen case but it's kickstand was broken so I was looking for a new one but this has been a disappointment.
"I was happy to see this product available for review opportunity to give my unbiased opinion.<br /><br />I've seen these selfie sticks all over the place and the use has intrigued me.  This particular Maxpro stick is great.  It is so easy to use.  I thought I would have to have even the teeniest bit of tecno savvy, but no.  The handle is very good, no slip, hard rubber.  It has a telescope that allows you to extend the camera about three feet.  There is also a rubber holder that takes my iphone perfectly, but I think it holds any smart phone.  We've had a great time using it at a recent family gathering that we could easily shoot group shots and immediately post them; it looked like we had someone else taking the picture.  It was a kick for those who couldn't make it.  You can't tell that you were the one that just took that picture.  You can get creative with angles and get very interesting shots.  Of course, there is a button on the handle that allows you to take the shot.  I'm going to be using this at my office to make business quick videos.  It is great.  I couldn't be happier.  You can actually see a picture of yourself from a distance, just setup your camera to show reverse, in case you ever get lonely for yourself.  You probably want to charge it up before using for about 3 hours; I did."
"Lasted for less than 2 months after purchase, Defective product. No longer charges devices. Seems like the cables inside became loose and have a false connection."
"While I can use this as a phone battery in the car, it does NOT have a cord that connects directly to the iPhone. I had thought it would.  It will be useful, but now I've got to go buy something to connect it to my phone.  Should be a one purchase deal as far as I'm concerned."
Unsure why I didn't buy one of these sooner. It's very convenient since it allows me to charge all of my devices at once. Looking forward to bringing this on my upcoming travels!
So far I love these headphones. They stay put whether I'm running long distances or working out at the gym. It's easy to use and functions well.
Awesome Product! I never write reviews but I love this screen protector. It was super easy to place on my iPhone! It's the first time I didn't get dust or bubbles under my screen! Highly recommend this product.
I swear by this brand and case. Even got my sister hooked. Have purposely thrown my phone across the room and it's still in new condition.
"Excellent product ,  I am very satisfied with its performance.  It's the second one I have purchased.  With one exception:  they do not furnish a printed user's manual, only a PDF file you can download and print yourself ( it's 120 pages long! )"
"Bought this for my recent trip to Asia and it did not disappoint.  I was able to recharge my phone battery twice a day which was critical for me using GPS to navigate.  Very reliable, I was very pleased."
"Product did not come with instructions.  Huge air pocket on one side of the screen which appears to be getting bigger over time  Could be defect in phone or faulty installation (but without instructions, who knows)."
"Just what I was looking for.  For the price, it is excellent."
"truthfully, I would love to give this case a good rating, but i just can not. It looks nice and feels good in your hand. The case does not seal all the way around the bottom portion of the phone. also, the camera lens is hard to clean. I did the waterproof test without the phone in it and it was successful. With the phone in it, it was in water for about 10 seconds before i could see water entering near the charger port. I have had two life proofs not and they are not worth even 1/3 of their cost."
Great case well made.  Customer service top notch.  They checked in to make sure I was very satisfied.  Great service.
Case looks great !!  Fits phone perfect
Good case.<br />Mildly infuriating that the apple logo isn't in the middle of the cutout.
"I wanted a clear case with a nice design for my iPhone 6. After browsing for a few hours, I decided to buy this one. I was pleasantly surprised to receive the product 1 or 2 days earlier than scheduled. I can even say that the case it's a lot nicer than I expected to be.<br /> Highly recommended it!"
"The case functionality is great!  fit perfectly, protect iPhone, magnet works great.  White case looked very nice when it's new,  however, when it got dirty, it was impossible to take the dirt or any marks off of the case. I used all kinds of different chemicals, none worked.  Since I loved the functionality, I decided to purchase the same case with darker color."
"Great product, easy to use, and gets rid of almost all cords. It's been a real life saver."
Great
Dont fit tight enough and wont charge unless sitting idle on a flat surface - pointless to have a 10' cord if you cant move or use your phone - TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY- already in the trash!
"The front clear plastic scratches pretty bad, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. I would order the original clear plastic from Samsung."
I love this case! I accidentally dropped my mp3 player in the toilet. Thank god the cover was on it because it saved it from having water damage. It is completely fine! I would recommend this product to anyone!
Do not buy! Worst screen protectors I've EVER bought. They don't even stick to your screen.
"After some initial issues, they refunded my purchase price and then replaced the batteries with several more that worked great. Obviously great concern for customer satisfaction and a great value."
"Does a great job of covering the front and back of your phone. If you pair this with a sturdy screen protector, you're phone would be indestructible."
Review should have stated not compatible with cases. I'm not going to take my phone out of it's case and put it back each time I work out.
"I love this watch, my friends were complimenting me when they see the watch, am so happy with it and good customer service."
"Fits nicely in the vent of my VW Jetta. I wish it was angled to face the drive, it faces perfectly perpendicular to the car. Not the biggest of issues, but still a small annoyance. Overall solid design and feature, my phone never feels like it's going to fall or slip out. Price is on the higher end for what it is, but it's a nice thing to have for hands-free driving"
"This unit has a small plastic roller that is on the top clamp. Looks like the intent of this roller is to ease installment of the GPS into to cradle and to prevent the cradle from scratching the GPS case. The first time I installed the GPS into the RAM cradle, the roller popped out. I was able to reinstall it after many tries. This was disappointing because I have always like RAM products in the past. RAM needs a better design for this roller. You must be careful not to allow too much pressure to be applied to the roller or it will come out."
"I had quite a bit of trouble with this product.  I normally love Sony products, so I was hoping that phone functions well.  This phone froze quite en, extremely slow response time  to the point not usable compared to my other phone - iPhone.  I tried to factory reset or limited the number of apps to very minimal, still no good.  I finally gave up on it and decided to purchase older model of iPhone with the same price I paid to purchase this phone on Amazon. Very disappointed."
"Very good camera, however, the holder that attaches to the windshield is poorly constructed, broke within 2 weeks of use.  Customer service immediately took care of the problem and replaced the holder.  Very good overall experience."
Loved this product!  Can take it anywhere and it folds down to a decent size!  #Selfies have never been so easy!
"I love this and it is top quality for a great price, hasnt ripped or been scratched up from dropping it or anything."
"I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE ITEMS THAT I BOUGHT,GOOD PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH,FAST DELIVERY,GREAT PRODUCTS.<br /> DEFENTLEY 5 STARS."
"Protected my phone from numerous drops, but scratches and chips easily."
"Beautiful case for iphone 6 plus. Great fit with some corner protection around the phone. It's a hard case with a very nice sheen finish to it, and I love the Disney tsum tsum prints which is very nicely printed. Definitely a plus for Disney tsum tsum lovers."
This is my second purchase. The product still working out great like the first set.
"I bought this case for my son and he loves it.  The case raises a little from the screen, giving it some more protection."
"Does what it should, quick charges my phone. Better priced then the OEM quick charger"
"Nice product, I don't use the credit card holder so no concerns with scratching.  Fits the phone well and all the buttons are easy to access.  Only four of five because the front cover feels cheep and is already starting to wear, but acceptable since it was so cheap."
"[[VIDEOID:1daa652d4401127e4c9c520c61eaba18]] Please see the video for more info.<br /><br />Basically unless you have a really wide or really thick phone this should work well for you. It allows for single handed operation and it fits without damage to the CD slot. Once installed it remains firmly in place.<br />Adjustments are simple and offer a variety of angles, not much to dislike about it unless as stated your phone just doesn't fit.<br />I like that it doesn't really block too much in my particular setup and it allows for no blocking of my air vents...something I really try to avoid as much as possible when looking for a mounting solution.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
This product is awesome. It cleaned up my charging station. I have a household with 9 people all with phones and tablets. Charges devices very quickly.
"Should fit any S4 variant EXCEPT the S4 Active. Should not matter if you have the T Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, or AT&T model in the US or the international model elsewhere. All of the S4's (Except the Active) were built on the same form factor.<br /><br />The purple battery doors were a special version available for the Sprint model. Now all the extras are showing up for retail to anyone.<br /><br />I have the purple door on my T Mobile version S4. Fits fine. Works fine."
works
"Very difficult to program, manual was very hard to understand. I have had several Analog scanners but now most police are Digital. The Terminology in the manual is all new that is unfamiliar to me. After many hours of trying to figure it out I became frustrated and sent it back for refund."
Phones are too big now a days to not have some privacy. THIS Shield is amazing. You can also dim your phone more to add additional privacy but it's not necessary. I love that I can be on an airplane and not have to worry about the person next to me reading personal documents or looking at my screen. Great purchase at a great price!
"This product works as intended to protect my phone's screen. The only downside is that it doesn't completely adhere in the edges and after a few months of use it stars looking really bad. Dirt is deposited between the edges where this doesn't adhere to the class and becomes imposible to completely clean, so the only solution is to change the protector for a new one. On other phones and electronics, screen protectors seem to last much longer. This might just be the way the phone is curved, but I think the screenprotector could be designed to cover a little bit less area and that way the edges will stick better."
I love Anker product!  I found their support is superior and their products are great.  I bought this over 1 year ago - using every single day - still works great!!
"The protective sheet did not separate on two of the three screen protectors.  The one that did separate was applied to cell phone, but it had little bubbles all over it that we could not remove.  Looked terrible.  We are trying a different manufacturer."
This has to be one the best battery packs out there and delivery was unbelievable thank you
Well first of all this is not even the color I ordered :( this is light gray and green not dark blue and green. Other then that it seems to be good
I use this for camping to keep my iPhone charged.  I'm really happy with my purchase.  I like that there are size options and plan to get another larger unit in the future as an emergency power option for all the devices in the house.
"If I knew my iPhone wouldn't fit into the arm band with the cover on it, I would never have purchased."
"Love this screen protector. I dropped my phone really hard the other day and I thought I cracked my screen, ended up just cracking the screen protector. It did it's job. I went out and got another one. Better to be safe then sorry!"
"Great screen protector, I am very happy with the fit and the way it feels.  Everything is still crystal clear and the screen is much easier to clean!  I highly recommend the Anker glass screen protector!"
I bought two of these.  Loved one for 20 days and it died.  Loved the other for 30 days and it died.  I heard the same thing from friends that ordered.  Sad because the cord is nice and long. Not a good product.
"I bought this primarily for mounting one of the small dual band ham transceivers which have flooded the market the past couple of years and for this purpose it works quite well. It fits tightly enough in the cup holder and is sufficiently sturdy to handle the weight (about  6 oz) of these radios. Due to the position of the side controls on the radio I have to clamp the radio only by its bottom half which means I'm using only the top half of the clamp and am not using the bottom feet at all. Nonetheless, it holds the radio securely even when using the keypad. Of course, it handles my Galaxy S6 with no problem. I question whether it would work well for much heavier radios, but that's not what it's designed for so all in all I'm totally satisfied with it."
"Received this product about 1 year ago and have been extremely satisfied with its performance up until 2 months ago when 2 of the ports failed. Probably caused by a wireless charger I had connected to these 2 ports. I called Anker Direct customer service and was told they would ship to me a new replacement product. No mess, no fuss. Very satisfied overall with both the product and Anker."
Great buy and would definitely recommend to anyone. It's up to google to work on improving the OS in adroid wear so we can continue to enjoy this project.
"I bought these for my car as I have a charging port in the armrest console and didn't want a huge cable mess to deal with. I have had no problems with this product, and it's nice to have several color options. I keep a couple of these in my backpack for others to use while at work. Worth the money if you only need a short charging cable."
Just got the case and it's great so far... Love the color and material; it has good grip.
Returned this product. Not a good fit.
"I received a discount for a fair product review.  Awesome screen protector, will recommend to others"
As advertised. Fast shipping. Slim case with good protection. Clear color is sophisticated looking.
Good charge extension for phone. Buttons pop off if it drops to hard and makes the phone a little difficult to use
"It may be my cell phone needs to be upgraded, but it seems that the charged batteries life expectency has diminished. I can not keep it charged that is why I purchased 2  batteries to insure I can keep the cell available."
"My mom has been using this case every day for a while now and figured it's nice to leave a review. The phone fits very securely into the open-style case, even though it looks very flimsy it holds up well. It looks girly enough for her and she has no qualms about it when I asked."
Fast Shipping! Great Case!
"I received my iPhone 5C Case, MagicMobile® Cute Ultra Slim Protective [Hybrid Impact] Hard Durable Thin TPU Cover for Apple iPhone 5C Armor Shell [ Black - Red ]Case with Clear Screen Protector by MagicMobile and all I can say is quality. This was a great case for the price. if you are looking for a great case that offers great protection look no further.<br /><br />Five star product for sure. I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
"The only reason i bought this band was because it was &#34;Red&#34;. Its not red, its a pink salmon color. It also collects animal hair and dust like crazy. However, considering its $40 less than the Apple brand ones its decent quality. You get what you pay for."
i really love this product i couldnt wait for it to arrive  as i love pink! it fit on my phone perfect! the pink color is beautiful and looks great on my phone! i received this product free for review and i definitely recommend it. its so cute!
"Tight fit for my Droid Ultra but it works even with the case on! Very comfortable fit, stays secure."
Shipped faster than expected. Love the colors.
My Double Din stereo doesn't fit through opening.<br />Quite obnoxious to assemble with a detailed instructions manual that's just vague enough about which part is which to be confusing.<br />$15 wasted.  This will end up in the trash as I'll need to buy a different kit.
"Love the color and case, one thing i would advise is to put thin flap on card holder to make more secure and then it would get a &#34;10&#34;"
Great kit.  Worked well and came with lots of extras to make the process even easier.
"Awesome and fantastic screen protector for Galaxy Note 2. Very easy to apply, shipping and packaging was great."
"We got this for our daughter & she loves the color & kickstand! Seems durable but we'll see if it lasts the whole school year. Regardless, the price was right."
Ive hade this charger for over 2yrs and still works great best money ive spent
Ita ok for the price losses connecting sometimes and doesn't last as long add it says it does dies just after about 3 hours
I have had mine for almost a month.  It's holding up great.  I would have preferred a more substantial wristlet.
"This case just came today and it fits really well on my phone.  I like the design, too.  It's relatively simple but effective.  It's a hard case so it's definitely more durable, and it really relieves a lot of the worries of damaging my brand new phone.  Unfortunately, the power button isn't working for me.  The volume buttons work fine, and it's possible to turn the phone on and off by touching the button on the bottom of the screen, but the case's power button doesn't press hard enough to push against the actual power button on the phone.  Still, it's a nice case, and definitely should hold up against daily use with my phone.<br /><br />EDIT: After a week or so of use I'm revising my review to say this case is awesome.  I've dropped my phone 3 times and a few chips on my case, but absolutely no issues with my phone.  The power button is working, almost a little too well... (I accidentally bump it from time to time.)<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in return for my honest review."
Heavy Duty!<br /><br />Pros:<br />My phone is now armored like a sherman tank<br />All ports are well covered to keep out dust<br />edges and backing are made of an awesome rubber shock absorber<br />Cornings gorilla glass of the front cover<br />bolts together with small alan head<br />comes with two tools and extra bolts<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very Heavy<br />Large foot print<br />charging port is hard to gain access (using apple brand chargers and its still a squeeze)<br />camera/home button not covered<br />alan head tool that came with phone started to strip
Nifty phone holder. Perfect for my Google maps app.
"This product is exactly as described. You can't ask for better than that. One thing, it ships from China. Took 2 1/2 weeks to get to us. If you can wait that long, I recommend. If fits my bluetooth earpiece like a glove. :)"
"Pr Mine lifted on the edges pretty badly but I ignored it and used it for 8 months. It fractured and made a line from left to right when i dropped it at waist height on a carpeted floor, when it was in a rubber case. Also developed a chip months earlier, which is where the crack stemmed from. It did do a great job resisting scratches, and from other reviews and research there doesn't appear to be any good glass protectors for this device, so maybe this is acceptable for this industry these days. Won't be getting another $10 from me though."
"It's not easy to find a great charger for the earlier generation Apple products - so I jumped on the opportunity to purchase this portable battery pack. My husband has an iPhone 5S and an 'older' iPad, he was immediately impressed with how compact it is and how many plugs it included.<br />This is a product he immediately put in his briefcase since it arrived. On a daily basis he drives over 100 miles for work so no more dead phone or waiting to get into the car to recharge.<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
"Great product - keeps me motivated to reach my fitness goals  -  This one was a gift<br />I brag about my Jawbone UP  to anyone who will listen<br />I had the bracelet  and  was not entirely happy . When it burned out I was reluctant to  get another Jawbone product  - glad  I stuck with you  -<br />The Up  is an improvement over the bracelet -  I kept losing the cap and  had  to keep a charger at home, in the car and at work.<br />I did not mean to go on and on.  BUT- the Smart Coach ... thumbs up  R&D  I.T.  people  -  like having my own personal coach .<br />Thank you and Regards,"
"At first this case was great. It looked sleek and looked perfectly, however over time this case has literally fallen apart. I have gone through 4 of these things all replaced under warranty but decided to get another brand after my last one died. The button can stop working, the kickstand breaks off, the case chips easily and the case stopped charging my phone when plugged in. Works well in the short run, but get ready for it to break after a month!"
Tuff well made little cord !!
Battery only last about 1 1/2 hr.<br />Great sound but battery doesn't last the 5 hrs it said that it does
"the software is horribly un-user friendly.  i dread having to add music/files.  compared to sandisks sansa zipclip, its the pits.  i hate the display, i hate the organization on the ipod...  the whole thing is counter-intuitive to use.<br /><br />  well, the things i do like is that it holds 20 gb and i got it used, cheap.  thats probably the only things that are good about it. i had a zipclip before and loved it, but there is a defect in how they manufacture the batter connection, so they are all destined to fail, and i wouldnt do that again.  at least the ipods construction is good.  useability on this model is miserable, though.<br />  oh, i hate the thumb mechanism to select files.  man, i dont know why they cant make one like the old 8 bit nintendo controllers.  that would be SO much easier."
"I was given this as a gift for Christmas about a year and a half ago.  i have to admit it was pretty cool and worked well for about the first 6 months.  Then the case on the phone started to fall apart and before long the rubber casing wasn't staying on.  So i just decided to deal with it for a while as i never really removed the case unless i needed to gte to the battery or card in the phone. Eventually, the rubber outline on the case was just too flimsy to use, so i came the Amazon and got a replacement case a few months ago and i was happy again.  However, the base would no longer charge the phone.  That was annoying enough, but now, if i plug in a cord charger to the case, that will no longer charge the phone either. Needless to say, i am moving on.  Good Luck!"
"Great back up or emergency batteries. These hold a charge just as long as the original samsung battery. Down side, when taking photos with your camera you can not use your flash. If you try to take a photo using your flash your phone will shut down. I use these batteries when my Lomui 3800 mah battery is getting low. Just keep one in my wallet and the other in my back pack. Once a month I discharge them and then recharge them to keep the batteries healthy and ready for emergencies."
It did not stick<br />In frustration  i just threw it a away<br />For the 6 dollars i spent on it i could not be bothered  to send it back
The lever that clicks the side button (ringer/vibrate) on and off broke so I had to stop using the case..
I'm am absolutely not happy! This is not a straight talk phone and I bought two. Now I will have to pay an extra $60 per phone to get it activated.
The charger works just fine it got here on time so thank you for that So in till next time this order gets a five stars yaya awsome
"Advertises that this works with the passport max but it doesn't. Let me rephrase that, it will hold the max, however it doesn't lock in place and slides off easily. Making u turns had thrown my detector all over the car. I'm surprised my detector hasn't been damaged because of this."
"Product is not as resilient as the OEM. Perfect install, then placed into my brothers pocket the morning he went to work, sat down in his car, heard a slight crack looked at his phone... Cracked!!! He bought his G2 new when it came oh so long ago... Oh well, what can you do."
"Small phone, don't like it.  Thanks!"
Had an issue with product...but Wireless Solutions are sending me a replacement. Excellent customer service!!
Does not fit in the CD slot as well as others. It causes any device I place onto it to jiggle while driving or idle. While most of these on Amazon are virtually the same; I'd rather spend even a few more dollars on anther brand.
Awesome! Works great with my Lumia 920.
"I ordered from Fixing_DIY just over two weeks ago. I waited on posting a brief review in order to avoid giving a premature positive review; just in case there were any problems. This has actually been the best screen replacement that I've purchased. No light bleed; Accurate colors; Matte black frame matches my phone; Plus it's responsive. The &#34;wedge/lifting&#34; tool however was pretty flimsy. Easy to switch between the two cases because parts were pre-installed for easy transfer. I ordered overnight shipping and received my package sooner than expected. Two minor nitpicks: the earpiece is too deep into the glass and the USB port has a very snug fit; it's sometimes a slight struggle to put in. Really no big deal, I can still hear people I'm talking to perfectly fine, and I can still charge my phone. Other than that, it's the best screen replacement I've purchased. Buy this item, I recommend it.<br /><br />Update: I dropped the phone on concrete from doorknob height a few days ago and nothing happened to the screen. Just some dings on the frame."
"This phone is fairly intuitive and easy to use, however, I started having memory issues after a couple months of owning it. I figured out how to increase the memory and disable some of the extraneous apps, but I have to check the memory every couple of weeks to make sure it doesn't start freezing up on me. I would not suggest buying this phone."
bluetooth with noconnect with bluetooth with no problem this is one of the best watches that I bought I will recommend this to anyone
This is my favorite car charger for any cell phone that uses microUSB. The cable is coiled so it doesn't get all over the place yet it'll stretch as far as you need it. The light is a good indicator that the charger is plugged in correctly (how many times have we thought we had it plugged in but it wasn't?). The charge rate is acceptable and I've bought maybe five of these over the years and they've all worked as advertised.
good charger but the cord is too short
"Great Selfie Stick I definitely recommend it. I take selfies every day with my friends and family, I will surely but another one for my Girlfriend. This Selfie Stick is easy to use and light-weighted. It is easy to carry anywhere with its compact size and is compatible with either iPhone or any other cell phone."
This case is HORRIBLE! it DOES NOT WORK! My son cracked his phone screen the first week he got this case.<br />It did NOT protect his phone at all and now we have to replace a screen and pay an insurance deductible.
"Revising my review. It's glitchy and crashes often. Has trouble with apps. Tried to install Pokemon Go and it took far too much effort. Now that the app is installed, it crashes constantly.    Great phone. I was nervous when it said &#34;Euro Sim Card Only&#34; but so far, the only problem I've run into is that it doesn't work with US LTE networks. Data transfer speeds are good. Excellent ergonomics. It takes awhile to get used to the Android system, but aside from that I like everything about it."
fit perfect
"Very cheap quality, carriage didn't align properly with the apple on my phone. I threw it out right after trying it on my phone"
"Works great. I have an Incredible 4GLTE with a case on it. It fits very snug, but it fits. Seems to be made of pretty heavy material as well. Looking forward to see how long it lasts. The two belt clip options are very good too. Seems to be a well made product."
Very happy with the purchase. I have paired to both my iPhone and Apple watch and they are comfortable plus have very good sound.
When I received the product it was just what I was hoping it was going to be. Easy to mount and easy to set how best fits your needs and the part that wrapped around the phone was well cushioned so it won't hurt the phone. Unfortunately after using it on the first day the spring popped out and it will no longer hold my phone so I sent this product back.
This product far exceeded my expectations.  My phone remains in place while I am driving and using it as a GPS.  I would order another Arkon Friction Dash Smartphone Car Mount.  I own and radio and TV station and I am letting people know how satisfied I am with this product.
The case is a very nice case.  My only complaint is it covers the bare minimum of the sides of the phone.  If it went up a bit higher it would be more secure and give much more protection.  It was a great price and it arrived much quicker then estimated.  It is a great case for a back up.  If they made one with higher sides I would definitely  order another one.
"DONT BUY IT , it breaks too fast ."
I like it. It covers my headphones jack and charger port . But not the speakers. Pretty hard too open and put it on.
"Nice and cheaper wireless headphones. Hurts my ears after wearing for +1.5 hours though. Can hook up to multiple gadgets (laptop, iPad, phone..)"
There is no way to replace just this glass as it is glued to the digitizer. I had to return this and buy the digitizer and touch screen glass as complete unit.
This is very good portable charger.  It is always ready to charge your portable devices -- simply plug in your USB cord and plug in your device and charging starts immediately.  It will easily charge your smart phone several times before it needs to be re-charged itself.  It will also charge an iPad or other tablet at least once before needing to be re-charged.
"From the past reviews, I thought this was a score at the price.  But I am not getting the same quality that I read about.  I have had numerous complaints about the sound quality from my customers on the other end.  From sounding like a bumblebee to on a very distant speaker phone.  My business relies on my cell phone, and I can't seem to find the right headset that works flawlessly.  Any suggestions...."
This little speaker sounds great and worked perfectly for turn by turn audio directions on my bicycle. It's also great around the house!
Tech21 has the best phone protection that doesn't get stuck in your pocket and isn't too bulky. I cannot tell you how many times I have dropped my phone. Heck I even dropped it as I was walking one time and kicked it across a parking lot. Tech21 was scuffed up but the phone was fabulous! Thanks Tech21!
Love this phone
"Item arrived EXTREMELY past due, it does not come out of the case properly, the screen protector is VERY CHEAPLY made & doesn't cover the screen properly, and the case itself- is only good if it is dropped. I would NOT recommend this product to others."
"This really is a great product. I thought the base was a little bulky when I first got it, but after &#34;installing&#34; it, I find I barely notice it's presence. It clips into the CD slot nice and securely, and maintains a secure grip on the phone (iPhone 6). The arm is firm enough that the phone doesn't move around and change it's position, even on bumpy roads, but I never find myself fighting and fumbling to find the right position. One-handed operation may take a little bit of technique, but is rather simple when placing and positioning; taking it out is easier with two hands, but still manageable with one.<br /><br />The main thing to keep in mind is the location of your CD slot, and whether your phone will cover up any other controls or displays. I'm using this in a 2006 F150 with a center console and a factory six-disc changer (that has never seen a single disc). As long as I place the grip at the bottom of the phone, I can still clearly see my radio display and access all buttons."
Bought this product because I thought it be a good quality coming from Samsung but when it arrived only one cord works and the other one works intermittently. Be warned there are better products out there for less.
what i got wasn't exactly as the picture described (the film does not wrap around the buttons) strangely this was a reason for choosing this over others for me. installation wasn't easy but got it right after messing one screen up.
"Sometimes the charging can be a bit tricky, I have plugged it in with the correct amperage and left it charge overnight and it was still not charged. this has happened a few times now, but every time I charge my phone with it, it works great and the flashlight isn't too bright but its just a power bank, I didn't buy it expecting it too be super bright. its a nice little bonus thrown in, its also nice to be able to check the battery status of your power bank."
am very satisfied with my item. It was well wrapped and arrived on time.
This was the easiest screen protector install I've ever done. The hinge technique is simple and intuitive. Definitely worth it.
"Great case, slim design and easy to pull out of your pocket but still provides a secure grip feel.  I had a screen protector on the front and back already.  I installed with the protectors still on there and it worked for a little while till the built in protector started sticking to the previously installed one.  I also noticed that some dust kept getting under the attached screen protector.  I removed the case and carefully cut the attached protecting film off the case and left the previously installed one.  Works perfect."
"I love the armbands for my smart phone.  I bought these so that I would quit forgetting to put it in the bag.  Now I have one in each car and one for the bag.  They are super comfortable.  The only part I have never understood, is that spot marked for a key.  I don't own a key that would fit in that spot.  I loved getting these in two days from Amazon.  I can start my week of right!"
Charges all my mobile devices fast. Very handy.
It was exactly what I wanted but....it was extremely large for my phone.  I would like full return or credit on my account.
Works well<br />Would be fantastic if it held more than four cards
"Love this USB charging unit, its small and allows me to charge my 700 different types of rechargeables. Works great."
"Fast shipping, great product."
"Your submitted review: Packaging was nice. Screen protector had blue stickers on both sides so it came super clean. Also, it comes with a wipe to clean out any extra dust that may have gotten in. The install was straight forward and simple. Clean phone, case, insert phone and snap in. Put rubber cover on and press into place.  Choose the color you want and press into back. Swapping is easy to. I received this case to review it from New Trent. Happy with it."
Cable works fine by using a Live CD (Linux) of the CHIRP software. I did not even try to use the included driver CD. The cable was used to program 10 Retevis H777 radios and a Baofeng UV-5R radio with no problems.
"OK,NO DISPLAY OR CHARGER PORT PROTECTION.HARD TO BEAT OTTERBOX DEFENDER."
My first Knivo completely quit charging and would not turn on.  The on/off button stopped working.  I purchased another on to give it another try.  I will see.  Holding my breath!
"Great unit, a little difficult to install so be patient.  Works great and map updates are continual/ongoing at no extra cost. I update maps 3-4 times per year.  It has my recommendation."
"This is a great little stand for my iPhone and Apple Watch.  The stand is bamboo and is very light.  Even though it is lightweight, it holds my phone perfectly.  My phone has a protective case on it and it still fits.  The watch loops over this holder and charges well.  The cable comes in from behind the stand and the extra cable stores in the bottom of the holder. There are 4 rubber feet on the bottom that prevent the stand from slipping.  The front of the holder has a small indent in it so that you can still push the home button while the phone is in the holder.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
Horrible fit!  Case would constantly fall off.
"Received on time,  It fitted in my galaxy perfect, the edges does not stick perfect, I do not know why."
"I like this case.  It was really cool when it arrived.  Pricey, but this company makes good products.  Unfortunately my case hasn't held up very well.  Threading started coming out a little, then a lot!  It's so bad now that the case really isn't usable.  I purchased this product in February of this year, and it only seems to have lasted a little over 6 months.  Slightly disappointed."
"Works great, so far it's holding up better than other chargers I've had. I'd definitely recommend this or another braided jacket cable. That alone helps them hold up better"
BOTH CABLES DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. IT DID NOT CHARGE QUICKLY OR PROPERLY AS THE OEM. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT.
"Poor quality as far as the color (black) on the outside part that covers the glass, the color started to erase easily after a week or less using my nail and simple touches to hard sufraces"
"I bought 10 of these 10 ft. cables because I like to charge two or three devices where I use them when they need it, sometimes in the bedroom. living room and office, and don't want to unplug the cord and drag it with me.  I had problems with the original order in that they quickly began to lose their &#34;staying connectedness&#34;.  What I mean is that the small port would lose the ability to stay in the device, it would fall out if I didn't loop the cord around my hand to release any tension on the plug or it would fall out.  Then I had to start putting something under the plug where it connected to keep it in the right place so the interior part would make the connection and charge.  Finally my tablet just wouldn't charge on these cords, my phone and Kindle would, but not the tablet.  So I called Anker and they said send them back for replacement.  Before I could find them and a box to ship them in Anker had sent me one cable, thinking that's all I was having a problem with.  I re-called them and explained that no, it was all of them and I was still looking for all of them, that I'd only found 7 so far (some had been relegated to a dead electronics coffin somewhere).  Anker said they'd go ahead and replace the other 6 then, and I would ship back the 7.  I had shipped the 7 back by this time, my 7 had crossed their 1 in the mail, and that I was not happy that not only had I had the problem with all the cables, but that they had gotten the replacement shipping wrong also (I had followed both calls up with an email explaining the problem and that it happened with 10, and the order number to show I had originally ordered 10.  I asked for overnight shipping because I was having to make due with one Anker cable and one cheapie Walmart one that I had from the old days and it was very inconvenient.  They not only shipped out the originally asked for 9 additional (adding up to the 10 in the order) but did it Fed Ex Express (it was Friday when I called, nearly at the endof the day, so that was as close as they could get to overnight).  I've waited a couple of weeks to write this review to make sure the new cables stay secure and they do.  I also wanted to point out that Anker provides excellent customer service and, in my opinion, goes above and beyond what any company I've dealt with in the last 20 years will do.  They provide what customer service used to be &#34;in the old days&#34; when companies really wanted the customer to be happy and would go to whatever lengths it took to make that happen.  I would totally recommend them for any of their products, feeling comfortable that the company has the customers best interests at heart and will resolve any issues."
I have had no problems with my purchase. I am a very happy customer. Would definitely buy again.
"This is a great armband for my son to use his iPhone with. He loves to workout at the gym and take long runs. It fits perfect on his arm and the velcro stayed closed while he was running. Marsboy Armband is also waterproof.<br /><br />It is nicely designed and seems it will hold up very well. I did have another armband for him but it broke within a few uses. He has been using it now for quite a while and it looks great, stays in shape, and is easy to take his phone in and out. It is snug so he does not have to worry about it falling out. He likes this so much better while he works out than a regular waist band or clip. I received this armband complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.  Marsboy Armband"
"The case is a little thin, but then we switched from an Otter box so the comparison might not be fair. The colors are vibrant and the product quality is good. I'd buy it again, and recommend to a friend."
"I bought this for the reviews and they are accurate. It is a sturdy cable, thicker than the apple that came with my phone. The connectors look like they will last a while."
"This keyboard works better than expected. There is no lag in typing and entry on screen. Connects just perfectly. And the best part is the amazing low price!! Don't waste your money on other keyboards that are more expensive, just get this one.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this is so inexpensive, but it rocks!<br /><br />I must say, I really love using this keyboard. I found it to be easy to use, accurate, lightweight, and the battery life even lasts pretty long."
"I live in the upper Northeast and started looking at solar chargers last winter, after we had an ice storm that knocked out power for almost a week!"
"Works well, replaced my previous device which was discount from AT&T and it lasted about 1.5 years.  When it indicates charged...take it off the charger because you may warp the battery and damage the charging circuit in the router."
"My previous case started cracking after a year and a half of use.  I ordered this one as a replacement until I eventually upgrade to a new device.  I was very pleased to receive my order a couple of business days later.  The estimated arrival window hadn't even started.  Upon opening the package I was pleased once again.  It came with a new screen protector, and also a handy stylus.  Only having one issue with the product, and it is more due to me not having my toolbox with me.  I can get 3 or 4 corners to fully come up over the edge.  One though, is trying to roll up and not pop out.  Once I go to the office tomorrow, I should be able to fix that.  Just needs a slight pry from a tiny flat head.  Overall, I am impressed with the quality, price, and shipping time.  Exceeding my expectations.  Keep up the good work."
"I've had the retractable charger for about 2 weeks, the retractable cord is already jammed.  I do not recommend this product."
"It fit perfectly -- Looks good too. But after 3 months the edge just cracks off, in each corner in big chunks. Customer service was non-responsive."
Excellent Cell phone charger
"For under $10 you really can't go wrong. The Note 5 is just to slippery to use without a case, and having had Cruzerlite cases for almost every phone I've had I purchased another one. It fits the Note 5 very well, and does not block any of the ports. Also, it allows wireless charging with my Tylt charger. Great case, no complaints."
"Built materials is excellent, great 170 wide angle image.<br />Just my personal opinion,  day videos are very good. Night vision is OK, same or closed night quality as Dome G90s. G1w has a brighter night video but less detail than this R1 Pro (up to 1080 only)."
"After two years of having this case, it will start to fail of you. But regardless of everything it is still a case and it covers the phone."
"This is by far one of the better case I've purchased for the Nexus 5. I've tried a handful of other ones. Simple enough to not be bulky, and protective enough that it won't scratch up the base and has a bit of extra length over the screen that it protect the screen also if you lay it screen down."
"Im sure its a good item, but it does not look good on the 6 edge. The sides are open and the borders catch a lot of dirt. Not so good for this phone."
The size is not correct since it not cover the display 100%. It seems it has not been cut properly.
I love all Piel Frama products.  This is a great sleeve.
Fast Shipping.  Great product.
Works exactly as described!  Perfect for my new charging station!
I know a lot of people who purchased from this seller so I thought to give them a try. I received a discount on my order for a fair review and this charger works really well. I will be purchasing more soon as backups since my puppy like to chew on my cords lol.
Seems as good as stock
Great piece of gear. It is sleek and very well built. I managed to fully charge my Macbook 2015 with this thing. Impressive!
Got this today and it batter thin I thought it would be fits on my arms i would recommend everyone to buy This for themselves<br />I got this product for a review and it was worth it
Very nicely constructed simple case. Needed a smaller case to go along with my heavy duty hard sided case that holds all mounts. This will hold the essentials for a quick grab and go. using Hero 3 black edition with this case.
"Case fits Xperia Z3 (t-mobile version). Provides great protection with the metal siding. My only complaints are that cell signal drops 1-2 bars with the case, phone becomes quite heavy, USB case cover and phone charge port are a bit of a struggle to work with, and case says &#34;Love Mei&#34; (can see a mile away)."
This item did not work completely. I am not entirely sure if it was the product or the phone had been damaged beyond repair. Item was shipped on time and came in excellent condition.
"I have owned Samsung smartphones in the past as well, as previous LG G2 and now the G4, which I have had for one month.  Whenever I read a review about this phone, I generally hear such &#34;CONS&#34; about the button position and the build quality. Just so you know, I appreciate both those features a great deal. First, the buttons, I hardly, if ever, use the buttons. I set the volume and forget it, what I don't like about phones with buttons on the top or side is that when you grab your phone or fish it out of your pocket, you can accidently send the caller to voice mail, disconnect them or decrease or increase the volume requiring you to phone fiddle, call back the caller or go to voice mail if they leave a message... a hassle. If I am at my desk and I get a call, I set my G4 to answer when I pick it up and say &#34;Hello&#34; no buttons to push... CONVENIENT.  sECOND. &#34;THE BUILD QUALITY AND APPEARANCE&#34;  Metal components on a phone adds to the weight when compared to plastic, metal can be dented and metal reduces the sensitivity of the phones receiver because it can block weak signals from the cell tower. As far as &#34;Appearance&#34; ... what the heck, most people are going to put a case on it anyhow.  If you like the touch features on your phone then you should know that the G4 can do everything by screen touch alone, even the home button is virtual and you can move it and the others around for your convenience and operating comfort.  Is it the fastest phone? No it is not. Is there any phone that is twice as fast? No there is not and even if there was what would it get you?  Typically, a G4 can open an app in one second, if there was a phone twice as fast then it could open an app in 1/2 second. What i9s that 1/2 second worth to you?  Battery Life for texting and calling can easily last the full day. Turning on Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, WiFi, full screen brightness and Hotspot will surely kill your battery in  3 hours but you can quickly replace it in 30 seconds and go on.for another 3 hours and by then your reserve can be ready again.  Tap the screen anywhere twice and the phone wakes up, in camera mode tap the screen anywhere it it snaps a picture.  In my estimation the lack of side buttons is a big convenience except my girlfriend is still disconnecting me when answering her S4 !  OK... It doesn't have a finger print reader but there are four other types of phone Locking methods such as, pin code, knock code, face recognition and voice recognition. As I said, when my phone is asleep... all I have to do is pick it up and say Hello, this feature can be turned off so that you do have to press the screen button to answer.  Lastly, right here on Amazon for the price of just $8.00 you can order a G4 Wireless charging receiver for your phone and install it in a under 5 minutes and that can be coupled to a regular or &#34;Fast Charger&#34; that the G4 supports."
I received this case On time and in new condition But it was the wrong color. The packing slip inside the package was for someone with a different name in a different state.    It seems to be a pretty durable case. I am a little disappointed that I ordered black and got sent mint green.  This was for my husbands phone because he keeps having problems with cases but he won't use this since it's mint green.   It seems to be a pretty durable case none the less.  The plastic back has me concerned that after a drop or two it would break.  It also has rubber on the top and bottom for a little extra durability. It fits around the phone like a sleeve so I would definitely be sure to get some tempered glass so your screen doesn't crack if dropped.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
"I bought this case for my daughter's phone. She loves it, but the fit is not as snug as I would have liked."
Does not work with a larger Otter Box case on an iPhone 6. But the Amazon Basics car charger I bought at the same time does work. Seems like a real lack of thought from the designers.
Was everything I needed. Perfect item and price was outstanding
"Contact issue. It won't charge, as the battery symbol in the display flicking, until I press it hard."
"amazing cell phone protector, we don't understand the science, but it totally protects the screen,  We put these phone guards on with the eCo-covers [[ASIN:B011324P18 The BPA-Free iPhone 6 eCo-cover includes IPG Invisible Phone Guard for free!]],  and no longer have to worry about breaking our phones or screens."
"Amazon's products never let me down, the lightning to USB product are great prices and work just like Apple products.  Great job Amazon!"
"Zerolemon sent this item to test and review. This USB charger is by far one of the best I've seen on the market. It will charge using all three ports without any problems. I own a Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6 Plus, and a Nexus 6. I put the charger in for all three of them and the results are as follows:<br /><br />2.1 amp port<br />Note 4<br />0%-100% - 3.5 hr<br />0%-50% - 1.3hr<br />50%-100% - 1.5hr<br /><br />iPhone 6 plus<br />0%-100% - 4.0hr &#60;-- Smaller batter but took forever even on the 2.1 amp port<br />0%-50%  - 1.5hr<br />50%-100% - 1.8 hr<br /><br />Nexus 6 &#60;-- Gave same results as the Note 4 due to similar size battery.<br />0%-100% - 3.5 hr<br />0%-50% - 1.5hr<br />50%-100% - 1.7hr<br /><br />I didn't test the other amp ports as they would've taken forever to charge. But I did notice one thing, on the 1.0 amp port, none of the phones were losing percentage as sometimes the case happens with cheap car chargers that offer multiple ports but can only charge through one port at a time due to bad manufacturing or design. I had all three plugged in with full brightness, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluethooth on with Google Maps navigation on and the 2 phones, Note 4 and Nexus 6, plugged into the 2.1 amp and 2.0 amp port respectively, were slowly gaining battery, iPhone 6 Plus on the 1.0 amp port was not gaining any battery for a long time but at the same time didn't lose any battery.<br /><br />Yes the 2.1 amp is for the iPad but all phones charged on it faster then the 2.0 amp port. I plugged in the latest iPad (Early 2015 Model) and with heavy usage on the 2.1 amp port I saw battery decreasing slowly even though it was plugged in. I didn't get a time for the iPad because it would've taken forever. With light usage the battery will charge slowly about 1% every two to three minutes.<br /><br />Honestly if its at all possible just proved 3 ports with 2.1 amps, this would create much ease for any other passenger in the car trying to get a quick charge on their phone."
Does not hold gps or cell phone and cell phone is a motorola turbo pretty thick phone.
Love the durability and color. The biggest issue is I can't get the case to close securely around the entire tablet. It's only on one side. It seems like the silicone is too big. I'll have to look for another product.
"Looks stylish, does the job, sits anywhere, and does not fall off easily (coz it sits!). It also has a sticky pad to its bottom, which adds to the stability of this phone mount. Love it.<br /><br />Bought similar product in different design before (alike almost all products out there), which relies on a suction pad on one end to STAND itself, and hold phone on the other end like an arm. This creates a lever and makes it too easy to un-mount itself from wherever it should stand. Also I'm not a big fan of magnetic mounts for 1. I don't want to have to add something to my phone in order to mount it, and 2. I don't feel safe to put electronic products next to magnets.<br /><br />Drawbacks: 1. This thing would sometimes hold down buttons on the side of my phone, in my case the volume down button, so it would silence my phone. This can be simply avoided by moving the phone a bit. 2. This thing fits so well in the car with or without my phone mounted, in a way that I found quite often myself forgetting about taking the phone off with me when leaving the car. Why couldn't it remind me my phone's still in the car? Bad boy!<br /><br />All in all, highly recommend this phone mount."
"I bought 2 pairs one for me and the other for my wife.  She didn't like them,  i gave it a shot.  The music part of it works well, good base. But the voice calls part was bad. The microphone had a problem picking up my voice,  i had to almost scream.  One side of the ear peace stopped working so i ended up shelving the unit and now took my wife's.  Lets see how long those work."
This case is solid. I have no doubt my phone will be protected from being dropped between this and a glass screen protector. It fits the phone incredibly well and covers no important areas and the buttons are still accessible. A nice new phone case of high quality. The kickstand is also a nice little feature for me using my phone for videos. I received this item for free for a honest review. This is very excellent quality.
"I saw more than a dozen people at Great America with this waterproof case, and had to have it! This was perfect foe Hurricane Harbor !"
"The device not work all that well (but, it does work),volume of the headset is a bit low, and while talking i have to speak very loudly to broadcast a legible tone for the recipient to interpret."
This selfie stick was really weak kept turning my iphone 6 around couldn't return it because past the date I brought it so now I have tapped it. and ducktape still wont hold my phone steady!
Was very cheap and didn't look like the picture. Was literally a patterned sticker on a white plastic case.
"Love this wallet - fits my iPhone 6 in OtterBox Defender case. With my phone, I can't overstuff with coins or other things but the phone fits -- its snug but doesn't seem to pull the zipper when closed. Very attractive look.  I bought the blue and it is more navy than the picture in the description shows.  But the stitching and zipper are sturdy - time will tell since I just bought it."
6 days of battery life with my Note 4. Need I say more?
I love this phone. It is a lot more than I expected in a cell phone. I would recommend it to  anyone that is looking for an excellent cell phone. The battery life if a little on the short side is the only complaint I have.
I love this phone! i bought this a while back and I still have it. This phone case is very durable just like the headphones and the charger.
"Poor construction, the clear piece separated from the side molding from everyday use.  The case lasted me a couple of months at most.  Will not recommend to purchase this case."
I bought two of these chargers and both craped out in less than 2 months. why is it so hard to get good chargers? I a waiting  for an authorization to return them. I want a full refund at this point
"This charger is a joke. It only holds the phone charge where it is but does not charge the phone up on either my phone or my wife's phone. Tried multiple outlets in 2 cars without better results. Tried the other charger i own and it charges my phone just fine. If I wanted a phone battery holder this would be great,  but no one actually wants that."
"I ordered the UP3 by Jawbone because I was curious as to my activity level during the day and interested in its sleep tracking abilities.  I have had the UP3 band for several weeks now and am very happy with my purchase.  It is so easy to use with the app installed on my phone that even my 5 year old likes to look at it to see if I am meeting me goals.  The sleep mode is a great feature of this product.  It is interesting to look at your nighttime sleep log and see how positive changes in sleep behavior impact my levels of light, deep and REM sleep.  Overall, I really enjoy my UP3 band."
"Excellent piece of hardware - I am so impressed with the capabilities that the HooToo has file sharing, movie watching, etc.  I am using this as a bridge for my wireless at home and the signal strength and throughput is awesome!"
My music always has a ton of static no matter where I am or what station I'm using. Also the buttons are really flimsy. I can no longer click on the &#34;next&#34; or &#34;previous&#34; song buttons because they are stuck and end up turning off my iPod if I push down too hard. I've only had the thing for a few months.
This is the only cell phone that I will use. I've tried the smart phone and took it back and said make my old phone work again. The main reason that I bought this one was that I left my old one in my pants and washed it. Rice in a bag didn't bring it back.
"Looks great on our end table. It is extremely easy to set up, more useful to hang up the watch."
i hav e a i phone 5 s and use a lifeproof nuude i dropped my phone in johnsons pond in coventry ri .it dropped it in 8 feet of fresh water for about 3.0 hours until we found it. we face timed it because the water was black and it was dark out . we found it and it works perfectly.also had it replaced for free 2 times because i sat on it and the edges had gotten distorted and they replaced it for free.t<br />  thank you life proof you are worth every penny.my neighbors are getting them now that they saw it works<br />philip casacalenda<br />coventry ri
"As a family of four with smartphones, tablets, kindles, etc we were constantly fighting over the chargers in the living room, or we'd secretly hide a charger or two in the bedroom to keep the kids from swiping them.  Then I got one of these, plugged in a couple of [[ASIN:B00VUNHJCS multi-headed charge cables]] and that all of that stopped.  Not only is there (almost) always a free plug, but everything stays put now since it's tucked away inside a [[ASIN:B0017K8W5W Digipower SAM-G100-CH charger organizer]].<br /><br />I'm tempted to put one of these at my desk at work since people are always looking for power there. Seems like a great way to meet your coworkers and have them feel slightly indebted to you..."
"Thin, easy to install, fits PERFECTLY, and looks GREAT!  Like many iPhone users...I've tried many cases.  This is the new gold standard for me.  Not intended to withstand crazy abuse or for the user who regularly drops his/her phone.  But for the 90% of us who carefully handle our phone....this one works great."
"Though the magnet works great, the CD mount version squeaks like a rabid mouse on amphetamines, even on smooth roads.<br />Seems secure in CD socket, but wiggles up and down enough to squeak constantly"
Very nice bulletproof case. Very sturdy like it a lot.
"On the plus side, the battery arrived more than a week ahead of the estimated delivery date, and it was identical to the original.<br />In fact it appeared to be an actual Apple part.<br />The included tools are absolutely necessary for the replacement.<br />There are no instructions included, but here are several YouTube videos that show the entire replacement process.<br />It only took 5 minutes beginning to end.<br />A lighted magnifier and tweezers are highly recommended as the screws are very small.<br /><br />I can only give 3 stars because the battery appears to be used.  Visually it was in mint condition, but diagnostics showed a 600+ cycle count.<br />That doesn't qualify as new to me.<br />Other reviews stated the same thing, batteries showing significant cycle counts.<br />For the price, with the tools included, as long as the battery holds up for a while, it seems like a reasonable deal.<br />It's just misleading to call it &#34;new&#34;.<br />The tools probably only cost a couple dollars to make, but they are indispensable."
Great product I love it but after an hour of using it my power bank stopped working I would for it to work again.
"This device is worth every penny. In two months we were extremely informed instead of in the dark. Super accurate, reliable and awesome. he features are fun to work with and the device never let us down. Until we lost it. Darn."
Kids loved it!  Great product!
I love this phone.  I have had it for almost a year and it works fabulously.  There have been no major problems.  Some time the camera loses focus during video.  But it is a great phone for the price.
"Made of good material and installed easily, but I didn't read that manufacturer made it purposely smaller to deal with phone screen's rounded edge.  This has the effect of creating a cosmetically unpleasant hard edge all around the screen.  May have to go with film instead. :-("
Heavy duty cable that works with my iPhone 5s. Will buy again.
Great charger for my LG G4 from the trusted brand Anker . I bought it as my workplace charger and it serves the purpose well. Green LED indicates Quick Charge while the blue indicates normal charging. I only wish the prongs would collapse into the body and gave the unit smaller footprint.
"Fits the phone perfectly and has done it's job so far.<br />Have trouble getting the case off, but I don't need to do that often so it isn't a true issue."
I bought this cases because I hate taking my case off to put it inside. I use a basic drop protection case that is smaller than an otterbox. I have an iPhone 6 and its snug. I can't imagine trying to squeeze one of those otterbox ones in this thing. It's a low quality armband. Don't expect much.
"First, I will say if you are on the fence about ordering this case - order it. It is a great value for the money. Is it identical to the Lifeproof case? No. Is it a great alternative for a third of the price? Absolutely.  I installed this case 30 minutes ago, so if using it in the real world necessitates an update I will. Install was fairly simple. I did have to reinstall 3 times to achieve a &#34;clean&#34; install (with only one minuscule dust particle - I'm gonna go with it), but in my opinion that's not unusual for this type of case. One note - the ringer switch needs to slide into the toggle/switch on the case. If you look at the inside of the case before you slide your phone in this will make sense. I tested the case with three chargers. Both the authentic Apple cable and the Anker cable fit, but the Amazon Basics cable did not fit the port on this case. Touch ID seems to be responsive through the case. Although you can tell that you have a thicker screen protector between you and your touch screen (especially at the left and right edges close to the rail) the screen is still plenty responsive. No issues there. For headphones the adapter has metal threads and the case has plastic threads. I am concerned this may be an issue in the long term. The volume and power buttons are a little bit on the firm side, but still acceptable. I noticed that the material for the Touch ID protector ever so slightly &#34;overflowed&#34; onto the screen protector area and is visible with the case installed at the extreme bottom of the display. This is one of the minor build quality issues that I think are characteristic of this price point. Overall I feel the Merit case was worth the money.  EDIT: After a week with the case on my iPhone 6 Plus the volume buttons have become easier to operate with a softer press required. Although the material used to make the Touch ID sensor work is slightly visible one the bottom edge of the display I rarely notice it and if doesn't affect viewing of the display in any way. I have not subjected the phone to submersion in water, but it has been exposed to lots of windblown dust in the desert and as far as I can tell if has not penetrated the case or ports in any way. Prior to opening the charging port door I cleaned the case with a damp paper towel and it was good as new. After a week with the case I have upgraded my review for 4 to 5 stars. Great product Merit.  UPDATE: I have had the Merit case on my iPhone 6 Plus for approximately six weeks now. My only update is that the door/cover for the charging port clips or snaps in place. Over the last month and a half I have noted that on occasion when I remove the phone from my pocket  this door has popped open. This is only a minor inconvenience, but I can imagine that in a more hostile environment than my office this could subject the phone to sand or water. Also, this same door has now chipped on back of the door. I don't recall any substantial drops that would have caused this. A picture is attached. The chip does not seem to impede function, but is unsightly."
"Really cool, this thing has a really smart design."
"I Traded in my old F 150 for a new 2015 Silverado. And I didn't realized how much I'd miss keypad on the Ford. So I started looking for something to put this truck. I did not want to drill holes in my new truck but at the same time I did not want something that looked all ghetto. A month later I decided to go with this unit because it was the most aesthetically pleasing unit i could find to fit the bill. Once I receive the unit. Quickly discovered it came in three pieces. First you get a window sticker (The face or number pad you see in the picture and on the outside of the window). Then the Unit it's self (The brains of the thing if you want to call it that). And Finally the wiring harness. The wiring harness is super simple. You got your basic power wires, lock and unlock wires and then (optional alarm arm and disarm). Realizing the window sticker was a one shot deal. I decided to bench test the unit before I started anything. The Unit it's self has a sticky side with backing on it. Where your supposed to peel the backing off and you stick the unit to the window sticker and you can actually see where the buttons of the unit match up with the buttons on the window sticker. So, I powered up the unit and touch the buttons. Very responsive through the backing material. Yey! Thats a win. Next step. I decided to mount the unit to my rear window. So it's kind of hidden but at the same time easy to get to. Ran and wired up the hardness to where I needed it to be. Then I plugged the hardness into unit. Was able program a 4 digit pin and the pulse for the lock / unlock functions.  And the unit worked flawlessly. Awesome Next step. Clean the window and apply the window sticker to the window. Then mounted the unit to the window sticker on the window. Thing works goodtill works. Because all The LED's still work but. Maybe my hands aren't warm enough or back window too thick. Either way unit does not work. And considering it's made up of stickers. I can't easily be remove to be returned it without damaging it. And since I just wasted my money on this little project. I can't really recommended for anybody."
Dropped my phone twice and it's still alive. Looks nice and doesn't add a lot of bulk. So far so good.
official samsung product CONFIRMED.<br /><br />charges my phone in less than 2 hours O_O ... this thing has the good original speed. It's probably best to buy this cord from the seller named &#34;samsung&#34; because other sellers might indeed have a knock-off copy.
"Item stopped working after 45 days.  Good idea, but poor execution on this particular cable."
"Love the phone, the camera is the absolute best!  but it's obvious something is wrong with it, and I'll have to return it. The phone has a glitch that makes it black out in the middle of what I'm doing. My emails don't download, Facebook keeps stopping unexpectedly, and I have to constantly restart it. Pretty annoying for an over $400 phone..."
LOVE THIS STAND!  It is the perfect stand to watch TV at my desk at work.  Made very sturdy and worth the price!
"It works line-of-sight only and therefore is not very useful if you're driving and want to control the head unit. It's just as easy to reach over and adjust the head unit manually as to aim this remote at the front of the unit. Also, it's larger than I would like."
"I have had other bluetooth headsets before, but none have worked as good as this one.  When I talk to people using this, they do not even know that I am on a bluetooth set.  That is how good it is.  I also stream music from my iPhone with this and the battery life will keep it going all day.  The phone battery life, not so good.  But that is because the cell signal is poor or low.  I do wear glasses so it does feel a little uncomfortable if the hard plastic &#34;clip&#34; is pressed against the ear a certain way.  I wish it could be made out of a softer material but then it may not last as well as the rigid plastic.  If your glasses have a thin piece that goes over your ear, then it should not give you any issues.  It is lightweight and the volume is loud, so you can hear it over loud noises.<br /><br />If you are expecting high fidelity music streaming, this does not provide it.  Definitely rather have it play music than not since I am not supposed to have music playing while I work.  (The LED does not light up when streaming music.  BONUS!!)<br /><br />I thought I had lost this a while back and the price went up $20.  I will buy another if the price drops back down.  :)"
"nice case. Fits great. So far I have not dropped it, but hopefully when/if I do it will protect my phone."
"virtually no directions.  I wasted on lens just trying to figure out how to apply it.  But if you value your ipod, you should use this product."
I like the case but the clip is not  as sturdy as they claim. On my first case the clip broke the same day. The clip was replaced and lasted almost a month and it broke again.
"Overall, this is a good phone case for an iPhone 5/5S.  I have a 5S and it fits well, and I love that it's my favorite color.  For me personally I don't really like the bulkiness it adds to the phone, but that's simply my personal opinion/preference.  Here are some pros/cons I have noticed with the phone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Includes 2 screen protectors so when one gets dirty or simply needs replacing you have a backup.<br />-Color is beautiful.<br />-Case covers the entire phone (back, sides, and comes over the front border).<br />-There are openings for the speaker and charger on the bottom, the ringer mute switch on the side, and the camera/flash on the back.<br />-Easily fit the charger in the phone while the case is on.<br />-Even with the ringer volume controls covered by the case they are still easy to use and you can feel the button actually press.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Makes the phone itself bulkier.  I have a harder time fitting my hand around the phone/case than I have with other cases, but I've been able to adjust.<br />-The lock button on the top is covered by the case and doesn't always work the first time I press it.  You can't feel the button press like you can with the volume control buttons and I sometimes have to press it 2-3 times for it to lock.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review.  My opinions are my own and in no way influenced by the seller."
Nice product and fast service.  It's not a real bass pounder but it adds to the overall sound of the car stereo
"I'm really happy how the harness turned out. there is 1 issue however. the accessory wire does NOT turn off the stereo. this is an issue on VW's end. simple enough, just rewire the accessory wire to either the fuse panel or the cigarette lighter. personally, I installed it on the fuse panel. (picture for more details). look at the other reviews for tips and advice in the installation of this product."
Just got it in the mail put it on and it was very easy there is no lag when touching the screen mand it works well with the otter box commuter series. Recommend buy
"I love this case but it won't accommodate the lightening cable from Amazon.  (The Apple cords work fine.) Still, I like it enough to keep using it even though I have to take it out to charge it."
"it is a nice pen for the price, works great with the ipad, and the ink side is nice.  the only thing is the pen is a bit short, but other than that I love it."
Does everything it purports to do.  Very good protection for an expensive GPS unit.
For a while I had one that used suction to stick to the top of my dashboard. On many hot days it would become loose and fly off. I love this design as it mounts on the vents and never flys off.
Picture seems to actually be a sticker on back of phone case... I imagine it will start to peel off soon.
It's ok but not so sure I would put anything in the pocket located in the back of the case that would really be a pain in they @55 to replace or that you have to report stolen. Bit it is do'able for the price
"Absolutely the best headset for serious business people who need to hear and be heard on a cell phone while in and out of different environments throughout the work day. This is a no frills headset, you can't listen to your music via Bluetooth through it or hear your nav directions through it (which can be good), but if you want to hear clearly and be heard clearly in and out of airports, cars, or while walking the busy streets, there is none better. With the larger filter on the mic I can drive on secondary roads, 45mph, with top off my jeep and hear and be heard with little to no issues. Amazing.  I have had 6 etymotic headsets, tried the wired version and keep one as a backup in case I lose battery power for Bluetooth version. The wired version is bombproof. Only criticism of the Bluetooth version rated here is it is a bit fragile which is why I have purchased a few of these over the years. Despite the fragility, I keep coming back to this product after having tried virtually every other highly rated brand. Nothing comes close to this if you are a professional and need something that absolutely works, period."
Use it all the time. Much better than the windshield suction cup.
The case itself holds up fine but the graphic on the back is a sticker with poor adhesive.  I've had it on my phone for a week and the sticker is already coming off.  This is a poor case and I'm disappointed that I bought it.
"Great product, has just about everything you need to get the job done!"
"This is my replacement set and I am very disappointed.  My first gave good sound and never messed up,  this pair (which is also refurbished) goes in and out all the time.  Maybe I should stick to new.  I'm not so happy"
Works as expected
"[[VIDEOID:f74ea91be658ade5bff7e1ac854a6877]] The Smarteck Qy8 Bluetooth 4.1 Headphone arrived within a couple days of being ordered via Prime. It was particularly well packaged with the outer device box containing two individual boxes.  The Bluetooth 4.1 specification was introduced in December 2013; the current specification, 4.2, was introduced in December 2014 and included some privacy enhancements. Bluetooth devices operate at approximately 2.4 GHz.  Most mobile devices are class 2 with a range of approximately 10 meters or 33 feet.<br /><br />OPERATION<br />I tested the headset with my mobile phone initially without charging. The received audio quality was acceptable, but that sent was not. Following several hours of charging using the included USB charging cable, I repeated the test using Skype's Echo Sound Test Service. This time, the audio sent and received was quite acceptable. Charging devices before use is generally recommended.<br /><br />The accompanying video demonstrates the use of the charging cable. A port for the mini USB connector is located on the side of one ear phone. A flap is readily pulled back using your finger nail. Once the standard USB end of the cable is plugged in, the QCY text on the other ear phone will display a red lighting. The red light will remain on until the cable is disconnected.<br /><br />Pairing with my Android cell phone and Microsoft Surface 2 Pro occurred without incident. Once paired, the headphone requires a few seconds to connect, assuming you have turned the headset on. To turn it on, press the button associated with the ear phone that has the volume control on the side; holding it down for 3-4 seconds is required. Turning the device on or off is associated with light and audible English speech indicators.<br /><br />OVERALL EVALUATION<br />As Bluetooth devices go, this one is probably as good as any, particularly in its price range. That being said, I've gotten much better audio quality results from a $30 USB wired headset than any Bluetooth device, including one for which I paid well in excess of $140. If wireless is a non-negotiable requirement, this headset is certainly worth considering. The Smarteck Qy8 is relatively inexpensive and features an 80mH battery reputed to support up to 7 hours of active use or 175 hours in standby.  It also comes with four additional ear buds in varying sizes.<br /><br />Ultimately, I gave the Smarteck Qy8 headset four stars.  It's a bit more complicated to use than my $140 Plantronics single ear device. Like any Bluetooth device, audio quality is not as good as with an inexpensive wired headset. The accompanying printed manual also pretty much required a magnifying glass to read so I didn't bother trying. By watching the accompanying video, you shouldn't have to read it either. Like Amazon Vines, I received this device in return for an unbiased technical review. Unlike Vines, less than 10% of my reviews are compensated. I usually spend an hour or more creating a video review, so I would appreciate you marking it helpful if appropriate.headset than any Bluetooth device, including one for which I paid well in excess of $140.

Came exactly on time and is excellent quality. The sides are rubbery so there's no breakage like with a lot of cases. I really like the feel of the coverings for the volume buttons and hold button. 10/10
"Just received today, and I am really impressed. This piece of equipment is a real good headset for me."
I purchased this case mainly for the belt clip/protective front cover which works well. The case itself though is another story. The fit isn't tight at all and you can easily slip the phone out of its protective layer without removing the backside hard shell. The silicone is just too soft and slippery. I am using the belt clip with a different manufacturers case (MoKo) that I also purchased on Amazon. That case is much more secure and retains the phone very well. I wish it had come with the belt clip portion like this case has since then it would have been perfect. All in all this is an inexpensive item so I won't knock it as it does add some protection to your phone and provides a kick stand so you can prop your phone up to watch a video etc. I probably would have paid as much just for the belt clip portion of this case if I were to buy it at a local retailer. Maybe my example wasn't perfect and another may fit tightly. I had the same issues with covers for a couple older Apple I Pod touch's where the silicone was just so slippery and soft that the I Pod would simply slide right out with any use. Hope this helps someone that is looking for a case for the Moto G. I would highly recommend the MoKo branded version as that case fits much more securely and also offers the kick stand.
"The only reason I did not give the phone case 5 stars was the cut out for the on and off was much to small. I had to make it bigger.  It took a  quite a while  I needed to use a knife, scissors  and a nail clipper.  I finally got it big enough and now it is fine.  The case was  a great price and it arrived much quicker then they estimated."
"ok headphones....I went cordless because Im a welder and often Im alone for long periods of time welding for hours. I got regular head phones but they seemed to always break at the 3.5 jack that connects to the phone. With these so far so good, Im on vacation so I cant really say they are good or not yet but I will update when i return to work."
"It's a nice case.  Looks good, fits the phone really well, and the grip is ok.  Felt a little slippery at first but for the most part it's been ok not great.  My wife has only had it for 2 months and the red coating on the outer shell is already chipping off near the edges."
"it fit my 2005 mercury mariner great, and looked good with the existing console, my new radio looks pretty good and the install went smoothly."
Nice product!
"i absolutely love this! its so soft! and my phone fits it perfectly! plus i dont have to carry my big ol purse, just stick the cards  use in the side pockets! it works great. i just throw it on the side of my baby diaper bag now so its so much easier to carry! thank you for making this a review product!"
"[[VIDEOID:81d6d464a3e989f9ed3070556f759119]] I got a free sample of this for review.<br /><br />I know it says \\""green\\"" and \\""red\\"" in the description, but the pictures are correct: they are indeed mint and pink. Which isn't a bad thing: it is a very nice pink colour, and it goes surprisingly well with the gold of the plastic bottom that slides out to make it easy to put the phone into the case.<br /><br />It comes in a nice, plastic retail case, which looks pleasant enough, and would still be nice if this were to be given away as a present to someone special.<br /><br />The cover also covers the buttons on the side, protecting them too, and the whole thing feels very comfortable in the hand, offering a good grip with its nice rubbery material.<br /><br />I didn't have an iPhone at hand when I made the video, but a later test confirms it is a nice, tight and secure fit, all buttons and sockets easily accessible and a much improved grip over the bare phone itself.<br /><br />It does build a little bit of thickness to the iPhone, but not excessively so. It adds little weight, almost making it feel lighter because of the increased size, but that added size is also padding that will potentially protect your expensive iDevice from a lot of knocks and falls.<br /><br />The rubbery material has a bit of bounce to it, which will help absorb shocks much better than many other back covers I've seen, also having a nice edge extending above screen height which might save it from a face-down fall to the ground<br />as well.<br /><br />In short: it's a nice cover that I can certainly recommend - if you like the styling and colour of it."
Classy and elegant but too tight for the Samsung Galaxy Light 4G (the inside has a label marked iphone5S?). Difficult to get phone and all sorts of buttons are pressed and changes to the phone. I think we got the wrong product ... can we still exchange it?
"It's kind of hard to get off without damaging it, but overall I like it. There was a little condensation over the camera lens, so I'm not sure if moisture got in or was already there."
Worked very well.  Ocean boating was a breeze.
the swirl did not met my expectations.  The ability to extend the stylus was difficult in that it came out and the part that is to fit into my 6Iphone is too narrow to fit snugly and therefore they fell off  often .
"This is a fantastic head unit.  Installed this with my factory sound system and did the Auto EQ / Time Delay adjustment and it made my system sound much better.  Eventually replaced the factory speakers with JBLs and a sub, did the Auto EQ again and bam, amazingness.<br /><br />The only thing that sucks about this unit:<br /><br />No FLAC Support :(<br /><br />No 64GB SDCard support.  Haven't tried 64GB USB sticks.  Will read 32GB SD Cards<br /><br /> Bluetooth support is meh.  Android will support changing tracks from the head unit / remote, iPod / iphone via bluetooth will not.  USB iphone/ ipod works perfectly.  I wish it would support metadata via bluetooth; like song names or currently playing internet radio station, but it does not.<br /><br />A small issue: when visualisation is active on the unit, and you hit 'DISP' to see the title of the current playing track or radio station, it will only display for 2 seconds - it will occasionally not scroll through the entire name in that time, so you will only catch the first 12 characters of whatever your playing off your SD card or removable media.  If the visualisation is off, it will constantly scroll the entire track name.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants high quality audio control of their vehicle but does not want to outfit their whip with a bulky multimedia display"
"I use this every day with my galaxy note 3, Charges it up no problem, very quick. This is a high quality product. I have used other anker products in the past, all amazing.  Never had any problems but my friends tell me that their customer service is unmatched."
So nice to have a multi-usb port to use. We have several products that use the usb cords to charge so this is perfect for my family. I received this product free or at a discount for my unbiased review.
"Had a problem, it was resolved quickly and professionally.  Great device.  Mounted the 520 on my Trike (sky-cycle).  Purchased the 5&#34; because of the smaller size.  Now, I'm thinking there may be enough room for the 7&#34;.  Thank you Sarasota and IFly !!  :)"
Thank you I got my order in perfect condition and the packadge was wonderful thank you very much I really like your service
"POWER POWER POWER! This sums it up, it provides all the power for my phones (Nexus 5 and OnePlus One). How much power?! 2.1 Amp PER USB PLUG! None of this BS 2.1 Amp if you use 1 plug crap... Nope we charge two devices at a full 2.1A ... Love this plug."
Really great case my last one was making my phone over heat and this is exactly what i needed and it fits perfect ive had multiple compliments..
Worked great & fit perfectly! Great find for the price!
"I used these on two new phones.  The cut was precise, and they went on easy.  Can't beat the price.  I just hope I never have to find out if they protect as well as the big $$$ brands."
A great battery for a great phone. Some of us power users need more than the standard and this is perfect. There isn't a bigger battery on the market. A full charge will last you at least three days. It's going to take a couple charging cycles for the phone to recognize the battery fully and you won't have to panic and rush for a charger at one percent either. 1% of a 10000 mah battery is another 5 hrs. Just try not to constantly run the battery down to 0.
Great selfies stick. Came as expected. Fits my Nixon coolpix camera perfectly and my galaxy S4 with a mophie charger attached to it. Great item. Extends perfectly without twisting for a great photo. Thank you
Worked for two weeks and now doesn't charge at all. I had one exactly like this and it lasted for almost a year.
Phone had a lot of cracks. Also when installing the service to the phone the worker said it was water damaged. Come to find out the speakers became loud static and Bluetooth to a wireless speaker sounds far worse. I would not recommend or order from this user again.
"Quick delivery, case looks great.  Everything was exactly as promised."
"Lightening cables in my house disappear quicker than the charge on my phone.  It seems like whenever I want to charge my iPhone, the charging cable is missing.  We have 3 iPhones in the house and we were down to 2 charging cables.  I purchased this Kinps 3ft lightening cable, MFI certified, so that I could have my own cable. I purchased black since the others are white and now I will know its mine.  The cable works just like it should.  Since it is MFI certified, I have had no problems syncing my phone to my computer.  The charging speed is great.  My phone seems to charge a bit quicker than it did.  The cable is 3ft long so I am able to use my phone while it charges.  I will be getting another one of these cables.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
Both cables stopped working this week. The connection between the cable and the plastic broke and frayed the wires on one and the other charges for about a minute and then says accessory not supported. Don't waste your time or money
Very well fitting case all button work only drawback is you have to remove phone back cover. But the protection it provides is well worth it.
the On/OFF button area is too hard to press. Should have a slit along each length of button area to release tension to the rubber and allow easy press of it.
There was a piece broken off the side of the case.<br />I managed to glue it but there is a gap.<br />Not very happy.<br />The case would be fine if it was in one piece.<br />I already sent a response via packaging review.
Really enjoyed this for my trip to Hawaii. It was perfect for hiking and we got some great underwater pictures. The only reason for four stars was that the touch screen could be really sensitive or non-responsive. We had a few pictures we wanted to get but couldn't get to the app to take a picture in time. But my phone survived the trip and the lenses were a lot of fun. We took a lot of pictures that we wouldn't have been able to take otherwise. It was awesome on a 14 hour kayak trip and an 8 hour hike to a waterfall.
"With the white bumper around the phone, my headphone and charger port was blocked. It's really hard to put on and take off, so after a week I kept the bumper off. The phone still felt quite protected, and there's been several times my phone fell and this seemed to help protecting my phone.<br />The case discolors very quickly. I purchased this in late June 2015, and now 2 months later, it is faded and very dirty looking.<br />I can't be too upset on the discoloration based on the affordable price of this case, but I am upset to see how part of the case makes the most important parts of the phone inaccessible."
"Great case.  Just wished the glitter moved more, but it is beautiful. Would highly recommend."
"Second time buying this item! Dropped my phone at work and happened to catch the ONE screw in my whole computer office that I did not pick up, thus cracking the protective screen. I reordered this on amazon and got a new one in the mail next day.When putting on the new screen there was a little bubble defect in the one corner. After calling Luvvitt they promptly, no questions asked, sent me a new screen two days after request was put in. The new screen went on just fine and my phone is once again protected. I would recommend this product to ANYONE looking for a screen cover. My co-woker has a $40 screen protector and honestly I could not tell the difference between mine and hers (I am VERY picky and detailed). She tried to explain &#34;well hers comes with lifetime replacement warranty and all she has to do is pay $15 for replacement now.... I paid $12 and free replacement when the screen had a bubble.... Beat that!"
"**UPDATE: I've now purchased two more of these for family BDays who adore them as well (especially for the receiving calls bit). This really is an arguably great buy. I also have customer service on speed email; they answer every question...and lightning fast.**<br /><br />To be honest, I never understood what the big darn deal was with all those pill shaped Bluetooth speakers at Best Buy. Sure, they look cool. And have decent sound. They are also ridiculously expensive versus seemingly much more capable, larger AirPlay counterparts. (My [[ASIN:B00903HKIS Pioneer XW-SMA1-K A1 Wi-Fi Speaker featuring AirPlay, DLNATM, HTC Connect and Wireless Direct (Discontinued by Manufacturer)]] is a rock star.)<br /><br />So when Vtin offered me the opportunity to review their Waterproof bluetooth speaker, I was intrigued...but honestly expected a 3-star review, at best. I didn't pay for this. And was likely to pan it.<br /><br />I'm eating crow.<br /><br />This baby is powerful. The bass on it is superb, likewise the mid-high level clarity. Build quality is surprisingly quite good for a $40 speaker. This feels VERY solid, has nice seals (for a supposedly waterproof device), buttons are responsive and nicely rubberized. No, I'm not running water over this guy to confirm...but feel cautiously confident it could take it.<br /><br />Sync was seamless for an iPhone (it took seconds), also playback. Just be careful to hold down the volume buttons during playback, or risk skipping songs.<br /><br />I discovered a bit of finickiness, however, when attempting to sync with another device...in this instance, an iPad Air 2. Bluetooth must be turned off on the original to de-sync the speaker. Turning the speaker on/off likewise is needed, in most instances, to properly reset. Closing a device or app will NOT de-sync.<br /><br />Phone use is perhaps the most impressive part of this device. The Vtin Waterproof Speaker handles calls like an ace, seamlessly switching back/forth between music playback and phone call. Mic is crystal clear. The mute button likewise works as advertised.<br /><br />For self employed peeps (who use music/calls regularly), this speaker is the bomb. I used the [[ASIN:B00GOI1HJA Pwr+ Extra Long 6.5 Ft AC Adapter 2.1A Rapid Charger for Asus Transformer Tablet Book T100 T100TA T100TAM T100TAF; Transformer Pad MG10 MG103C TF103C TF103CX TF0310C B1 C1 H1 H2 B1 B11 A1 10.1 Inch]] charger to keep this guy power happy.<br /><br />Last, customer service is surprisingly outstanding.

My S-10 works very well. I'm a happy camper with my purchase.
"I use this on my bike with a Samsung Galaxy S6 with the Otter Box case. The roads in my town are not that great, and when hitting bumps, my phone doesn't even move. The bands fit just perfectly to still plug in my headphones. The bands do fit very snugly, so I hope they don't stretch over time.<br /><br />P.S. Please don't mind the dust on my bike. I was gone for a month."
"Love it, doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone compared to other otter box cases. The pink exactly matches the pink iPhone 5c. The grey on it looks great too. Was easy to install"
Happy with delivery time and product! I like that the charger tip lights up to help see in the dark!
This little gadget really reminds me to not forget my cell phone before leaving the house.  Great for me.
I gave this to a friend for a gift and she absolutely loves it dresses her phone up nicely
Great portable Charger for the money!
"Was VERY excited to receive this. I thought it was perfect for my son's scooter. Alarm system works like a charm. I activated a new line with AT&T and installed the iPhone 4 SIM card as instructed (I think. The lights blink slowly, but the off switch doesn't turn the unit off. Have to reset it for them to turn off.) I downloaded the app. I am able to locate the scooter thru real-time tracking, but the device shows as offline. Can't get it to respond to text messages and can't setup the sos phone number. :( My son is disabled and needs this scooter for college. Can't afford another one if it's stolen so I need this working. 1 star until it works."
It's a great screen protector but like others have already mentioned the little tabs on the corners eventually peel up. These really should be sold in a multi-pack because you'll end up replacing it every month or two.
"Works well, has guide lines."
"The plug prongs that plug into the wall outlet are set lower than other models like this. The lower placement makes it so that the top of the charger blocks the 2nd outlet. In my opinion, I would prefer to have the use of my second outlet, so this is getting returned."
It arrived on time as promised. I love the product! it holds my phone perfectly while it's charging and navigating for directions.
"Ok, but it does not come with the adhesive to attach it to the screen,  so the calibration is of a bit since I had to use a different kind of tape."
"The unit is made very nice and sturdy, but if you have steeply angled air vents (such as the ones on a 2014 Hyundai Tucson), it's not practical to use.  Only recommend for air vents that have a more vertical orientation."
"Bought to replace a disappointing battery from RayOVac/Batteries Plus which was not lasting a day.  Went to them after none of the $5 motorola batts sold online that I tried were out of date and wouldn't hold up.  This battery is lasting through the day with about a 50% drain, which is good for an old droid x.  The battery did fit in without a modified cover, but it was tight and I had to pressure the door a bit to get it to close."
"Pretty amazing GPS.  Very accurate, clear with a huge screen.  My only gripe is that it does not show where the red light cameras are.  That would really help considering we have so many in the NYC area."
"Loooooove it, great price, looks better then the pic. Fast service. I will sure recommend it. I'm a happy client."
"This works great for phones both Apple and Android , but my observation ipad charge up time is significantly (25%) slower than directly plugging into Apple Ipad Charger."
"I ordered one for a good price, and I ordered the right size, but it came in the wrong size. Wish it would've came in the right size. Other than that it was cool."
The thing that holds my gopro in place snapped within 2 month of ownership. Good thing I did not lose my gopro! At first I have nothing but good things to say about this product but in time I realized it is the same as all the cheap quality selfie sticks I have seen. Go spend a little more money just to get the best quality.
"All you could ask for!  I've owned a portable solar charger before but it was junk compared to this!  Lightweight and sturdy. A quality product! For the price you can't beat it! I do most of my travelling on a motorcycle, so not having a charger outlet becomes a hassle. This keeps my phone at 100% until I reach my destination. Customer service is also as good. Had a question regarding the product and received an answer within the hour. AWESOME PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE"
"This is a fun little gadget! If you are like me and enjoy taking selfies and group photos but have a hard time getting everyone in the picture, this makes it SO much easier!<br /><br />It's pretty small when folded down, which is nice because I can just toss it in my purse and take it out whenever needed for a fun picture or group photo. It held my Galaxy S4 with no problem, but it was a bit of a stretch for my husbands iPhone 6Plus. It may be suited to smaller phones, just to be sure that they are held in place nice and tight. Nothing will ruin a selfie quicker than having the phone come crashing down, right?<br /><br />The Bluetooth was easy to pair and synced to my phone quickly. With the push of a button, I can take my pics and it has not given me any problems at all so far. I received one to review and have had a lot of fun playing around with it since it arrived. This would also definitely make an awesome gift for any selfie lover you might know!"
"I have seen some complaints about the EL lights not working after a short period of time, but I have had this cable most of the summer and use it once a day at night to recharge my phone. I have had no problem with this product and the lights still illuminate and &#34;move&#34; when charging a device. I think it is a good product if used gently and responsibly."
The phone I purchase from Amazon was sent to members of the family friends I do not have any rating at this present time there was no complain from those family members about the phone its old phones are still working if the phone was in this country I could give it a 5 star but at this present time I could give it the three star but no complain
"not water proof, but only water resistant. My phone got wet when I took it underwater, but I continue to use this case when I take my phone near the water to protect from splashes."
I'm a utility worker. I'm in my truck & utility rooms all day. Not only does the mount work great in the truck... The magnetic piece on the phone allows me to stick my phone on any bit of metal and work hands free. The Center console on my truck it also metal. No more digging between the seats to fish out the fallen phone... This little novelty item has really simplified my work day. Ive already recommended these handy little tool to my company and co workers... Great product.
The charger charges fast and the recharges your devices fast.  Great product.
really strong material to hold your phone while jogging and working out. I put it in on the sleeve of my shirt and it stays there while I work out.
"got them super quick, iv had them for a while now and the colors are still so vivid and not a single scratch on them and that's cause i drop my phone A LOT."
"Very thick wire, seems to be true to gauge, but as it says is 90% aluminum, which isn't the best conductor. It was fine for what I'm running and the spot that I needed to fix, and should be fine as long as your amp is in the lower range of requiring a 4 gauge power cable, but I wouldn't use it for anything over 700w because of the heavy aluminum content. Good wire for the price, but it's better to go with a full copper wire."
"Love my blue. I can say this phone is all studio blue saz it is. The extras are fantastic to have.<br />I ditched my high end android.. For this sleek beauty.. And happy I did.. Hats off to you studio blu ,keep up the good work.."
Fits the phone perfectly snug and looks slick.  Has a good grip as well to avoid having the phone slip out of my hands.
I love this mini speaker. It's so useful and loud! I last a really long time around 4-5 hours for me. I had Prime so it arrived 2 days after I ordered it. The sound quality is very crisp. I'll order more for friends!!
Good sound.
I bought one and was pleased with the product quality. I just ordered two more for other family members.
Right size<br />Not too bulky
"I love the case. It came on time and came with a screen protector and small stylus, which was a great surprise. Only reason I cant give it 5 stars is because you can only put some muc b cash and cards in it. I can only handle like 4 cards with little cash. But all in all a good buy"
Perfect fit for my iPhone 4...totally fixed my power connection and detection (when the software disable the speakers because it falsely detects being docked).
Good phone but not for people that are not tech savvy
It works mostly but doesn't connect to the Garmin app and sometimes it just quits tracking you. Also stops if you don't move over a large area. Get something else.
"I've had this phone for a couple months now, it's a serious upgrade to my first gen iphone that I was using but my only problems with this phone is that after only about 1 month my screen cracked at the bottom it was never dropped or set down hard it was unexplained I just woke up one morning and there was a crack its nothing major. The other problem was the audio speaker went out also the battery life is not good but I use Wi-Fi I heard that's why. All in all I really love this phone so far I am very happy I bought it and no contract!! You can't beat that for the price of this phone. Its really fast too."
Nice device but mine did not come with directions so I have no idea if I'm using it correctly hence the 3 stars. But that light feature is awesome!!
"What a great little recorder! Video quality is great. It's funny that I get a note to review this device only a few days after I witness a traffic accident where both drivers claimed &#34;the light was green&#34;. My recorder captured the entire event and provided proof of liability for the driver that ran the traffic light. The only issue that I have is that the &#34;emergency&#34; mode recording is triggered extremely easily (perhaps by going over a speed bump with anything buy extreme care). Setting the sensitivity to low (or even high) makes no difference. The bracket provided, while fine for most applications, did not have the range of motion needed for my car and where I needed to mount it. I had to hack up the bracket and cobble in some plastic pieces to fit the camera in front of the rear-view mirror where it would not interfere with my vision.<br /><br />Otherwise a great, inexpensive product that I highly recommend."
"I use this to play music from my phone in my truck.<br /><br />Works as advertised except for 2 problems:<br /><br />1)There is a buzzing noise through the radio when no music is playing from my phone.  It goes away when music is playing and then it actually sounds darn good.  I tried a ground loop isoltator like others have recommended.  It did remove the noise, but also degraded the sound quality, so I'd rather just deal with the buzzing during the rare times no music is playing.<br /><br />2) The unit does automatically connect to my phone when I start up the truck, but, for some reason the music plays through my phone speaker instead of this bluetooth unit unless I disconnect and reconnect the bluetooth, every time.  I have 5 other bluetooth systems around that are no problem - if I play music while connected, they just work, but this one is the only one that doesn't automatically play nice with my phone."
allows for cool photos
"Really good fit on the phone, but sometimes the rubber doesn't grab the plastic edge. Otherwise excellent and good prtection for the device."
It is functional and protect my kid's iPhone well very. I like the wallet feature. The case is not as tight-fitting as I like.
"The case does just what is says it will do.  I use it all the time when outdoors gardening and boating. I can operate the iPhone very well while it is inside the case and even take and make phone calls. It isn't water resistant when you're wearing headphones because the headphone cord keeps you from closing the seal tight.  My one reservation is the lanyard. I like it because my iPhone doesn't fall out of my pocket when I bend down. However the phone swings around on the lanyard and get's in the way. I have to tuck the phone into my belt or pin the lanyard to my shirt to keep the phone from swinging around on the lanyard.  I recommend this product, especially for people who spend a lot of time outside."
"This case is beautiful, however it has a snap closure that you need to press down hard against the glass of the phone to close. Not a good design.  If it were a magnetic closure, I would have given this 4 stars, but it's not worth it."
Appears to be a great case.  Hard plastic with rubber edging.  Also like the screen protector that is included.  Have no problems using the touch screen with it.  I just wish the colors wouldn't have been more pastel.  There was a  darker purple one from someone else I liked better but didn't have the touch screen protector this one did.  So white is a good substitute.
"Fantastic product.  Luckily I haven't had a chance to test it for impact protection, but love how the coating keeps fingerprints way down.  Bought another screen protector for a different phone I bought for another family member at the same time, it does nowhere near as good a job."
"Just received mine. The build quality is excellent. You have 2 options to secure a piece of ferromagnetic metal to your phone, a small disk or a rectangle that is thinner and smaller than a credit card. These can be attached with peel and stick adhesive or placed between your phone and your case. I chose the latter, since I have a simple Belkin case on my iPhone. The device fits securely into my air vent, and the magnetic force is adequate. No problems to report."
"Had an excellent transaction with vendor. Item exactly as described. But, on to the actual case itself. It's a very snug fit, all the buttons and holes are perfectly aligned. Within minutes of putting the case on for my wife, she dropped the phone on our hardwood kitchen floor, not a scratch or even a mark. The only thing is the lack of directions, which should definitely be looked up before putting on the screen protector.<br />I was never a fan of 2 piece cases, but this one looks nice, has done a great job protecting the phone so far, and was an excellent value.<br />When I upgrade my phone(or my wife's), this is the first place I'll look for a case for it."
"Rugged cable, good quality. Didn't help my cell as my power jack is bad but worked perfectly on other usb items! Amazons price was a third of the truck stop price and half of other stores for this same item. I will buy one for every charger I have."
"I love this product. It charges itself quickly and charges my phone faster than plugging it into the laptop or wall. The battery also lasts a long time for me. I traveled on and off the last month to 3 different locations and this definitely came in handy to charge my phone when I was out and about. It fit easily in my bag and has enough power to charge my phone through multiple charges. I was even able to offer my friends' phones some juice because of how well this held up. I highly recommend this product, it was worth the price for me!"
We use it at work to connect Ipad to TV.  It works absolutely great.  We had to use it last week for a meeting.
"so i ordered this case because fall out boy is my favorite band. it actually came in the mail sooner than the expected delivery date said, which is a  big plus. didnt have a problem putting the case on my phone which is  a samsung galaxy S3. the only problem with it which is really minor, if you put the case on, it stays on, and i mean  its sorta hard to get off. but other than that its awesome. great quality. would recommend!"
"These sounds great but have some serious UX and quality flaws. the inner lining of the earphones is only GLUED, not stitched... so it recently started to tear away from the foam padding. Really not ok. Has seriously affected the functionality.  :(  :("
Easy to install works as described with my iphone 6 don't have to take the phone out of its protective case either.  Easy to mount.  No complaints here!
"It looks very nice, protects mobile when falling. One single drawback is that these drawings of butterflies start to disappear a little at a time."
"Works well.  This is a replacement for an old cover that was placed in dryer by mistake (heat melts an inner liner).  The seat does slide as I enter and exit the car, that is my only complaint.  There is another model that is advertised as non-slip but I didn't purchase it.  I had my last one for over 10 years with no problems."
This was on my 2014 Christmas list and Santa didn't come :^( but it was in the high 100's at the time. Around $50 this is an absolute steal.<br /><br />I bought this to use on my boat as the radio was in it's last stages. Using the Deck unit with connection to my cellphone was phenominal to say the least. We put the unit on the dash or wherever. The sound was very good and loud enough to hear behind the boat up to 20 feet with intesity and clarity. Everyone was impressed that you could get this much quality sound out of such a small unit. I ran my DECK all afternoon from 12pm - 6pm continuously with no issues.<br /><br />Being able to now drive our listening from songs loaded to my Android phone or via streaming on Rhapsody was over-the-top. I can't say enough for how well this performs (at least in my application).
Out of all the NFC tags you get with offer the key chain one is the one I use the most because it is so portable they stick well and are great in high it like in my car in the hot florida sun.
Great phone case!! Very unique and attractive. Exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful design.
"This does a great job at holding your device your way.  I chose dashboard mounted and took the advice of other reviews and used the supplied  little disk as a base. The method it uses to lock and unlock the device from its &#34;claw&#34; is outstanding. It's a little ugly, but who isn't!"
"I like the case. It is not as big as the otter box, which has some disadvantages, but it also has advantages. The biggest problem I hav is probably not the case manufacturers problem. The iPhone chargers fit perfect, but other chargers may not fit through the charger hole in the case."
It's a really great cd  player. The one thing is it makes the cds  really really hot. But other than that it works well and is a great cd player. It's easy to install and we'll worth the money
This is the best portable charger I have ever used. It charged my galaxy s5 4 times and my galaxy s4 once all in one charge. It has been great!
"I've been using this lightning cable at work for the last week and love it. I sit in a cubicle and am always trying to keep my surface area clean. The design of this flat cable allows me to run the cable up the back wall and easily clip it into place to keep it organized. The cable works perfectly for charging your iphone and ipad. Quality is very good, I highly recommend it."
"Quality is good, but it has sharp edges and very uncomfortable to hold. I will return it. I wish they fix this flaw."
"Works flawlessly, very satisfied with this product! I was skeptical to purchase after the nightmare the old school FM transmitters were, not any more... the iClever proves that it can be done right... if you are on the fence I strongly encourage you to make the purchase, great gadget at an awesome price!"
Only 3 months of use and it is already falling apart. I'm convinced there is no good lightning cables out there.
"I have had this holster for about a month now, and it is holding up extremely well. It appears to be very rugged and well constructed. It is also very versatile, because it can be attached to a belt in a variety of ways. As shown in the pictures, it has a heavy duty metal clip which will allows it to attach vertically to a belt, but it also has provisions to allow a belt to looped through the holster either vertically or horizontally, eliminating the possibility of becoming unhooked from the belt. It also comes with a &#34;D&#34; ring to enable a 4th way to attach the holster to a backpack or whatever. It holds my BLU 6.0 phone perfectly and securely. I would highly recommend this quality product for those of us who do not put our phones in our pockets."
Ok case. The giraffe emblem seems like it will pick off easily bc its just coated on top of the silicon case. Great value though!
Great product!!!  The range is excellent.  I have walked up to 45 feet from the receiver and it was still linked.  Sound quality is very good.  Does not get interference/humming noises like I saw in other reviews when in use and on the charger at the same time.
"Outstanding Cable! It is absolutely worth spending the extra money to get a genuine FTDI Cable, Works flawlessly !!!"
Update: died and unfroze and still very impressive.  This is is really cool for the price but cheap. I have had it for three days and not it has froze. I'm gonna return if it doesn't work once it dies.
"After about 2 years, the battery life on my i5 was down to about 4 hours of typical use, so I figured I would get a new battery.  The highest rated battery with tool kit on Amazon would not ship to my location outside of the &#34;48&#34;, so I went with another seller's product.  The tools are fairly low quality and I broke one of the plastic pry tools during first use.  The other, smaller tool was able to get the job done (there are 4 different plastic pry tools in the kit; 2 guitar picks and 2 chisel-like tools).  The replacement of the battery was quite simple with the only challenge getting the separation of the screen from the back case a bit of a challenge (look up YT videos on the process and be slow, gentle, and patient).  The reason for 2 stars is due to the tools being &#34;functional&#34; for the task.<br /><br />If it weren't for the tools, this would be a 1-star review as the battery itself has proven to be essentially worthless.  It is identical to my original battery in all markings except one: It's old.  Very old.  the original battery in my phone has a manufacture date in 2013.  The &#34;new&#34; battery I received with this order has a manufacture date of 2012, so it has been sitting on a shelf for 3 years.  I've had the battery in the phone for several days now and run it through several charge/discharge cycles to be sure, but I can't get the &#34;new&#34; battery to run my phone for more than about 3 hours.  I'll be popping my phone back open and putting my original battery back in so I can get at least 4 hours and then looking for yet another battery source to see if I can find a newer battery that will function at near original capacity levels.  At least I have the tools now, so I can search for just the battery."
The worst wasn't even the case I wanted it was a Fake imitation case of Kate spade and was very  piss about it
"I got this for my wife when Amazon had it on sale.  I read a lot of bad reviews for many bluetooth hands-free car kits over the last couple months.  This one caught my eye because although there were only a few reviews, they were favorable overall.  I decided to give it a try considering the low price and considering the great Amazon return policy.  I installed this for my wife and routed the cables out of the way.  I paired it with her new iPhone and showed her how to control the unit.  She is a happy camper.  She is far from tech savy but she has no problem remembering and operating the simple controls.  The audio quality of the microphone isn't as great as my factory system but it really is good quality -especially considering the low cost.  The audio quality for streaming music from her phone is great and that is how the unit is used 99% of the time.<br /><br />We don't use the cigarette ligher USB adapter portion of the kit because I already bought her one that is much better quality.  That said, the one included with this kit seems to be good quality and that was a surprise.  She keeps it as a spare -just in case.  We are very happy with this unit and I am considering getting one myself.  My factory hands-free unit only supports calls over bluetooth and I want one of these to handle music streaming."
Touch screen is very poor. It respond too late and need to press hard. Not a good phone to have.
Just what I needed. Offers great flexibility for mounting GPS.
I've had no luck programing this unit at all. at one point I was able to transmit but now it will not transmit and in dual channel mode it emits a constant beeping noise.
"The case, while slightly pricey, does fit perfectly and is really good protection for the Go!"
good protection of the  phone but looks like it does not exist
"Often the detector doesn't go off when you think it should (when you come into contact with patrols on the freeway). I drive by an airport every day and the detector doesn't go off until it is right next to the radar, seems like it would recognize it further out especially such a strong signal. Regardless, ran up on a radar gun today (on opposite side of freeway) and the detector never alerted me. Again seems like it would have triggered an alert. My friends had one over 15 years ago that seemed to work better. For reference the detector was mounted level at the highest point on my windshield. Albeit I have limited experience with radar detectors.  You need confidence in a detector and I don't have any in this model."
This was everything I was hoping for. Reviews of various products were kind of iffy and I was worried that this might be a dud...but it turned out to be a winner. I have no hesitation in recommending it.
Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design
"Awesome case! Bought this as a back up case, but I already use it more than the main case. The colors are fabulous, very sharp looking, and it doesnt come loose at the corners, so I don't play with it and ruin it like so many other cases I've bought.<br /><br />For tactile people the waves on the back are superfun to run your hands over. I don't normally like gild, but this is soft and offsets the blue bery nicely"
"I got mine in the mail the other day ,and the day after it had already started to break down. The &#34;ink&#34; in the front came off very easy."
"Use this for my Note 5. Charges at a good rate, works great."
"Phone looks and works great, unfortunately it wasn't NEW.....numbers in the call log and pictures in the phone gallery when received . Very disappointed!"
"I've been looking for a backup battery for my Samsung Galaxy Ace Style S765C for a year. The others I looked at had mixed reviews - they fit for some people and not others, so I didn't purchase. I tried this one and haven't had any problems with it. I'm happy to let all searching Ace Style S765C owners know that this battery will fit your phone! I'm so happy to finally have a backup, it's one worry off my mind. Thank you AceSoft!"
Great cable i use one for my desk setup and it bends and holds it shape well have had it for a long time and it hasn't broken at all and i am really happy with the build quality of this product i would never buy a cheap cable again these cables are the best.
"The LG G fits works very well and I am very well pleased.<br />The only thing was I do not think the account was not wright when I got visa bill.<br />I would like somebody check and make it wright . This whole think started because I had to return the first one , not the one."
Love this cable. It's really well made and super sturdy. Way better than the one that came with the phone.
"Having used this for 2 yrs and this is the2nd one purchased, never disappoint with Apple products"
Great replacement battery.  I purchased two of these.  I always place the date I purchased them.  The price was good and the delivery was on time.
"I LOVE this tiny little speaker! It is so adorable and the sound is incredible for a speaker of its size. I use it in my office and at home when I cook, and you would never guess how small it is. It is so easy to take with me on vacation. Another plus is that it connects very easily through bluetooth to my phone and computer. (It is much easier to connect than other/larger speakers I have had.)"
"We bought this for our daughter's phone, its a good solid strong case that will protect the phone."
I'm really bummed about this adapter. I was so exited to get it after reading all the good reviews. I've only been using it for 2 weeks and it's already giving out on me. I've had others that have lasted well over 6 months so am a bit disappointed. Wouldn't recommend this unless mine was just a dud. Maybe that's the case?
"Great phone. I've had this thing for about a week and so far so good. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 but it was 3 years old and lagged a ton. I'm a casual user and mainly use my phone for social media, texting, and the occasional photo/video if I am out or on vacation.<br />The screen is bright but it's not as bright as a Samsung Galaxy. It's also huge and does hog the battery. I'm not a heavy media user so the battery life is fine with me but if you are constantly on your phone and watching youtube etc I'm sure this won't be the device for you. Under heavy use, you'll probably only get 10 hours on one charge if you're lucky. I get about 24 hours between standby and social media use. Some have commented that you can't see the screen in the sun but I see it just fine on the &#34;auto&#34; setting.<br /><br />The phone does get pretty hot if you're playing games or doing things that stress out the processor. GPS use will definitely heat up this phone and there is an overheating warning for if you up the brightness while the phone is hot. It hasn't just plain shut off on me so the heat isn't really a bother.<br /><br />Camera is nice. Works really well in well lit areas. In low light, it does drop in quality but not bad.<br /><br />Other than that. I'm enjoying this phone a lot. It doesn't lag or anything and is running just fine and a worthy upgrade. I can do everything I did on my S3 but without the lag. :) If you are a casual user and want an affordable phone that works well, this is a good option."
The Worst thing I've ever purchased. Did not fit my phone at all. Entirely too small and not properly aligned i have a Galexy 6edge and couldn't use the edge featured with the cover
This S6 Edge charger case works good. I would recommend this case. It does take a little longer to charge then I thought it would but most phones charge faster when directly connected to there own charger. I did receive delivery more the two weeks before they said it would be delivered.
Good protection except no rubber around edges.
I use this while out on my kayak and it works great for my phone.  I am able to take pictures without the fear of my phone getting wet or falling in the lake.  Keeps my phone nice and dry.
"If you are planning on using this cord with an Otterbox Case, it won't work."
This product works great.  We have two IPhones and two IPads hooked up to this where we sit.  It works great and I highly recommend it.  The company did a great job packaging it and getting it to me on time.  I probably will order another one for the bedroom.
I was disappointed it didn't have a remote on the stick but it works
I absolutely love this case!! Shows your whole iPhone while protecting it!! Best case ever!!
I take this with me every time I go to the beach and it works Amazingly!! NOT a single drop reaches my phone
"fast shipment, great quality for the price."
Works in the Phone but doesn't perform any better than my 3-year old batterie. They probably sat on the shelf for 3 years waiting for me... :-(
"I was in NYC and needed gps and apps to get around, borrowed a friends Anker to keep iPhone charged. I was impressed with the Anker and ordered my own when I got home. Great product, good value."
"Love the ability to change wristband colors to coordinate with my workout outfits. However, the clasps require a bit of work to make sure do they stay fastened."
had a little snag activating the phone . After a US based person got on line they activated the phone and it works great.
This is my second one.  Excellent product. Great service !!
"Excellent battery. Definitely purchase a 2 amp wall charger to juice this thing up quickly. The piano finish gets a lot of flack but I prefer it over the new PowerCore's matte finish. The PowerCore will slide right out of your hand, whereas the E5's finish is grippy. An added benefit to this over the PowerCore 15,600 is that this one is shorter lengthwise but has a slightly higher capacity. I can deal with 3 amp output vs 4.8 amps for the PowerCore."
After looking for a good small portable speaker I decided on this one. All the reviews sounded great.  The speaker surpassed my expectation on both sound and battery life great product!
Cheap but it works.  &#34;Instructions&#34; are a joke.
I love love love this solar charger! The thing about smart phones is that they use a lot of battery power.
"Fits perfectly.  You don't have to struggle to fit your phone into the case - it slides right in.  Covers the volume keys which actually makes them easier to access.  It also keeps you from accidentally hitting the &#34;silence&#34; button.  Haven't dropped it yet so I don't know how well it protects from shock. This is my first iPhone and I wasn't going to get a case, but this actually makes it easier to handle."
Sound quality is great but battery life is short-about an hour and a half. Can hear my music over the sound of my riding lawnmower without having to turn the volume up all the way.
"Did not work consistently, had to hold in place just to charge, then stopped working all together after 4 days,"
"As waterproof cases go, it does work. I put weight of phone, in coins in pouch with a tissue and dropped in bucket of water. floated and all stayed dry. CAUTION THOUGH: At first I just put in a bunch of coins and didn't weight and it sank, fast. So, be sure to try at least the weight of your phone, if it is heavier than mine, it might not work. Not the easiest to close and open, nothing fast about it, but I can take on boat without worrying about it getting splashed or falling over board. Not easy to take photos with though, so I usually end up taking out of pouch to take photos, which could defeat the purpose of even having it. If you ever attempted photos with your phone in the sun, especially with glare off the water...it is hard to see phone alone, and with the case on it is even harder. I purchased some waterproof camera floats and attached one to the loop on this case for extra safety about sinking. Does't matter how waterproof the case is if it sinks to the bottom of a lake.Despite it being a bit awkward, it still gives piece of mind and that makes it worth it."
"Sounded fine but not built very well, within 10 minutes the product wireing came loose and stopped working in one ear"
this arrived defective - one of the channels was not working and created extremely loud feedback. by the time this was determined Amazon would not allow me to return it.
The unit worked fine and I got my 40 year old cassettes transferred to flash drive then to the computer.
"This product did not work in the least.  I have little cell reception and placed the outdoor box in a clear area on top of the roof, but it did not improve my signal."
Just what I needed to fix my screen. I recommend this product for anyone that has a cracked screen for the Note 3.
"perfect fit, easy install, exactly like the stock one.  overpriced for what it is but whos gonna bother to send you anything for less than $5"
shipped on time and fits
Love this light.  It fits perfectly and works great.
Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
Great product. It's everything I expected and love it. Went on easy and effortlessly. 2-pack is great Price can't be beat. Highly recommend
"I'm not normally a review person...but I will say this is a wonderful case / wallet.  The phone case is very slim and looks professional, while the magnet that secures it into the 'wallet' portion of the case is very sturdy and keeps the phone in place well.  The best part, in my opinion, is the quality of the leather.  Thanks!"
Works well the only problem I have had is it will not work with my surface but it works with my phone perfectly that's why I gave it three stars. Still a good product though.
It works but it has to be under the sun while charging good for camping on sunny days
Loved the fit and the idea of a case but when I took it off there were little scratches where it had rubbed on the SS.
It is such a nice case.  It looks like a wallet.  I love it.  It is a pleasure to hold.
"The package came at record time, very fast, I like the durable and color of this case, however it is too hard for me to press the buttons.  :("
I received everything as advertised.  Great deal!!!
"Love the design but it is off a little, doesn't &#34;hold&#34; the apple right. Also doesn't seem to fit the iPhone 6 correctly. Offers no protection, cover came off and phone broke after three days."
"Our son likes to throw our phones on the floor.<br />With this case its safe and i don't worry about the phone breaking. The case is strong, I've even spilt liquids on the screen but the built-in screen protector works amazing!!!!"
"Very nice quality and fits the TomTom 5100 perfectly. I only wish it was half as thick though, as the unit has to be tucked into the pocket or equipment straps on one side, leaving the other side empty, or it will flop around. Good if you had a power cable or something to carry, but mine is fixed to the car mount."
The was a gift that the person recevied said was awesome.
I never would have imagined that something like this would be this fun!  The cat especially loves it.  I run it all over the room and the cat chases it like crazy.  The AR part of the sphero is especially awesome!
Stopped working after a little over a month of usage... Mainly used to Listen to music only... Manufacturer please contact me... Very unhappy since I can no longer output any volume out
Tried this out last weekend while in the mountains so I didn't have to run my generator just to charge a cell phone. Worked beautifully! Hooked my GoPro up to it along with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and had both charging immediately. Both devices were fully charged rather quickly.
just as description stated. snug fit around phone. beautiful colors. MUCH cheaper than what I found in local stores.
Works good for wifes phone. No Problems.. :-)
"My iPhone5 has a new life! My screen had started coming off, and after an internet search I suspected that the battery was swelling. I thought I'd take a chance on this since it's way cheaper than getting a new phone or having this repaired.<br /><br />There were some bumps along the way. For example, I initially removed the screen without the frame around it. You have to lift up the frame as well in order to get to the battery. Unfortunately I broke part of the frame while trying to pry it open. Removing the battery was actually fairly easy despite what youtube videos suggested... I think the key is to pry it up from the left side just like the included instructions show.<br /><br />In the end I powered on the phone and it had about half a charge left, which is great. The whole phone snapped back together and looks pretty much good as new. The battery seems to do a decent job of holding charge. Overall, great experience, really cheap solution."
"I simply recommend this to ANY iPhone/iPod users out there who fix their iPhones/iPods.<br /><br />I have used this tool kit for my iPhone 4 and my iPhone 6+ and has been completely helpful the many times I have used this product. Whether it be installing a new screen to just simply taking out the SIM card, this tool kit has done justice for me."
"The iPod nano has gotten so tiny these days, I bought the arm band basically so I didn't drop the thing.  Good quality construction.  All I need in a band.  No complaints.  Came fast and free with Prime."
Very convenient product ! Charges two iPads two iPhones and 2  apple watches  quickly at the same time and still have another slot to charge something else and I have another outlet  ! Looks nice and  sleek ! Very happy and would definitely buy from these guys again ! Shipping was fast !
Worked once and not too well.  Then nothing. Total waste of money
I am very satisfied with Birugear 4Pcs Stylus/styli Touch Screen Pen.  I will recommend Birugear 4Pcs Stylus/styli Touch Screen Pen to anyone.  The pens are very good to work with.  I ordered a different name brand a few weeks ago which was cheaper - well you get what pay for.  The tips of the pens were so soft they were had to us.
"2 amp output has been helpful for charging USB battery packs while hiking in remote areas. It draws power even on slightly cloudy days, but you should charge a battery pack, not an iPhone directly. The iPhone will cut out as soon as the tiniest cloud crosses in front of the sun, and it will not resume charging until it is unplugged and reconnected. Charging directly to USB battery pack (Anker E5) resumes as soon as the sunlight returns without having to reconnect the wire."
"I was able to purchase this at a discount for an honest review.  I needed a charger at work that was as fast as my home charger.  This is just as fast, and it shows up on my phone as &#34;Fast Charging&#34;.  So, it is charging more than twice as fast as a regular charger.  This is key since I am always on the move, and can only charge for small periods at a time.  I am VERY happy with this charger set."
The product works very well but the adaptor portion is too long if you are planning to use it on a motorcycle like I did. Unfortunately it will hit the tank if you are making a tight turn.
"I've tried to place this on my dashboard for at least.... 13 times and that's what happens:<br /><br />The mount holds for the whole night and when i get back there in the morning, to check it out ... i gotta see if the mount is either under my seat or somewhere else near the door it means ...this doesn't hold properly<br /><br />if you wanna place it on the mirror though, then it works GREAT<br />I have placed it on the mirror for over 3 weeks from now and so far it didn't fall"
This item got deliverd fast . and was the right part i have order parts befor and it was not at all what it said the description but this was not he case fast and the right part i am happy
It did leave a couple of air bubbles  other than that it's a good product
"Initial reaction is &#34;wow these sound good&#34;  Bluetooth connection worked just as described and no problem.  Only difference from &#34;Chinglish&#34; manual is where it says LED will turn green when connection is successful, mine blinks blue instead.  Only took approx 1/2 hour for initial charge with included USB connector.  Quality appears acceptable but time will tell in use with travel as I intend."
I purchased as a replacement battery for a 5yo device. Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But if you own this device don't bother with replacement.  Clear was sold to Sprint about 2 years ago. I received an email in April 2015 stating they will no longer be offering the Clear WiFi service after October 2015.
"This worked great. Perfect for driving with gps or music. Works good for iPhone 6, but I upgraded to 6plus and it does not fit"
"Good armband, a little on the small side. I have average/small arms and it can still be hard to wrap around and get a snug fit."
Working well thus far. Total bargain!!! We purchased these for our tablet and phones and it works well with both. It also works
Overall product is very nice and appears to be well made.  I have owned this product for about 3 months with no issues.  Sound quality is very good once you make sure you have the right size ear buds on to completely fit in your ear.  I would buy this product again.
Great speakers for the price.  Easy to install into my '15 Tacoma and sounds pretty good.  I would buy them again
This case did not look like the item online but much to my surprise it was actually nicer and of great quality. Not sure if it was redesigned and pic was not updated but I'm happy with what i got. Thanks
The white part got brown within a week of using.  It wouldn't come off.  Threw my case away after two weeks because it looked so dirty.
"What do you know, my 1 yr old smashed my phone on week 1 of me buying the glass protector. It shattered but the screen did not! yes! Does exactly what it needs to do.<br /><br />Easy to apply, looking through instructions beforehand was more useful 2nd time ;)"
This cheap version of a lifeproof case was a waste of money. Broke within 5 minutes. Would not recommend to anyone.
"Disclaimer:  I got this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I love this portable charging station.  It is one of the best designs that I have come across.  I bought it for travel, as I wanted more than 2 usb ports, and with this, I can plug in my laptop as well.  I love that it has a power cord design so versatile…I can unroll it and it can sit on my bedside table or desk, but if I wanted it to hang on the wall socket, it can do that too.  The only annoyance is the super bright blue indicator light that lets you know power is on.  It does not have to be so bright!!!  I will have to tape over it with masking tape or something like that as I'm using it next to my bed.  I would deduct 1/2 star for that if i could. Packaging it came in was busted open when it arrived.  It looks cheap if I were planning to give as a gift.  However, they made up for it by including a nice pouch to keep it in for traveling, which i greatly appreciate.<br /><br />I wish they would make an international version -- with the interchangeable international adapter plugs, so I can use it worldwide too.<br /><br />Update November 25, 2015<br />I deducted a star because the snap that holds the plug broke when I tried to take out the plug for use.  So, I no longer feel this is the best design anymore, and I've found a similar one with a better design where you slide the plug in, instead of popping it in, and it has pink, blue or green accents. However, I have not written a feedback for that yet as it died on me in about a week of use.  Waiting for my exchange before I review.  At least this one still works great, and I've used it in England and Asia for about 2 months."
"I love purchasing items from Anker, they have products that always work and their customer service is nothing but World Class"
Sticks great and moves well with my phone. I keep it up on my windsheild and it doesn't budge while I drive!!
"This is a great product if you have multiple USB-powered devices. Feels very substantial. The bright blue LED makes it a bit distracting for a nightstand. My main disappointment was that it will not charge my Asus Transformer Prime tablet, but then again I have been unable to find anything other than the original charger that came with it that can."
"Hard to keep from getting bubbles, maybe its just me. Like the matt finish, no finger prints."
Fit perfectly on my phone.
I love this case!  I actually use it for carrying my sunglasses in my purse to keep them from getting scratched.  I love the painting and enjoy seeing it every time I put on or take off my sunglasses.  I've gotten compliments from several people because this is such a pretty and unique case!
"Love these cases, lightweight and fit sung the rubber on the outside edges keeps them from slipping out of your hand."
"Works great.  Very durable cord, seems to be holding up well."
The case is beautiful but it doesn't fit my phone. I triple checked what phone it said it was for. It should fit my phone. In fact I also bought a green case from this company and that one fit! So I thought this one was safe. Very disappointed.
Am really disappointed I bought 2 of this last week and I only got 1screen and after fixing it on my phone  it has a black line in exactly the middle very disappointed with this seller
"Fit the phone, made it water proof, just caused a lot of problems with the camera, looked like you were taking a photo in a tunnel. It inhibited the accuracy of the touch screen as well. Just not real happy with the case."
I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />This 3ft charging system arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assemble.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with this cable.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
Functions as advertised.  Initially unaware of dual sided tape used to keep Charging Set in place when reinstalling back to phone.
Very durable and long enough to use while in bed and plugged in to a socket inconveniently placed just out of reach of the OEM cords.
It doesn't stay put. Meaning it just comes out so easily. I'm guessing its because of the size. Otherwise its a great charger.
"This is a replacement to an old Belkin 2 usb port charger I had used for years! This is better in that it has 1 quickcharge port kind of to future proof for newer phones that support it and 1 additional port to charge whatever else. Right now I use this to travel, it charges my Nexus 5, Ipad, & Moto 360, so only 1 charger with 3 cables much lighter and organized. Only downside is that it's a bit heavy so it might come loose in the outlet. So just make sure to give enough slack on the cable as to not put additional weight that might pull it out from the outlet."
"worst set of headphones i have ever bought, i live with my headphones in my ears, must have at least 17 pairs; this was by far the worst money spent towards headphones👎"
You can take this anywhere and do whatever you want to it and its performance doesn't change. It's much smaller than I thought it would be but it packs a punch. Definitely a great speaker with easy connection.
"The blue is not blue it looks more purple, but it's a pretty good case"
My charger works great and comes in handy. I got blue which is very pretty. The product is a little larger than I expected but that's fine because it still fits in my pocket. I just wish the package it arrived in was strong because mine arrived with a crack in it. It's not very noticeable so it's ok.
"The case is slightly too big for the phone. Although it does keep the Samsung s6's slim look, the actual phone shifts in the case and do not protect the phone at all."
"Nice case. Not as protective as my previous Otterbox, but I really love the slim design. Who doesn't love pretty colors?"
"Great case. I use it with a glass laminate to protect the touchscreen.  Love the orange color, makes it easy to find. I'm planning to order a spare for the time when this case gets worn out."
"It is a nice lightweight case. The gold color is nice as well.<br />However, it scratches easily. Also, the kickstand broke within a couple weeks of use. Lastly the the hole for the headphones/AUX cord is off like 1/8cm.. so some plugs will not go in while the case is on.<br />Overall, it was a decent buy for the price.. but I probably wouldn't purchase one again."
"Initially, this would have received a 5 star rating.  But, as it no longer functions (after ~1 year or light use), I recommend it with warning.<br />This was plugged in permanently on my desk at work, removed only during occasional work-travel.  This week it stopped working as a wireless charger; does not power on.  The battery does still charge and discharge though, so it's not a total loss."
"Great Product at a great price.  Works as promised and provides secure placement for your iPhone and is comfortable to boot.  I would recommend this to runners and walkers everywhere.<br /><br />I find the Iphone 6 itself too big to enjoy wearing in the gym, but that is due to the Iphone and not this product.  This will work for the gym if you don't mind the size of the Iphone itself."
"Practical, and nice design. Meets my needs."
"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a welder, so he obviously sweats a lot throughout the day. He still has it, uses it all day every day and loves it. He can hear it while he is in the weld shop, and it sits low enough on his neck it doesn't get burned.<br />I chose the black so dirt wouldn't show up like it would with the white (like I bought).<br />I have a different brand that is ~60 bucks less than this that I use at the gym. The Bluetooth capability on this one holds much stronger distance wise than mine does. I would recommend this over any other brand, any day, and he has recommended it to many of his friends as well who have purchased one."
Absolutely love it! This summer was one of the best thanks to this protection! I wish I would of bought it sooner
"Bought this for my significant other who is a huge BTTF fan. It is a slim case for the iPhone 6 with grooves for grip which is beneficial since most plastic cases are slippery and cause the phone to slide out of your hand.  The sticker is as displayed in the advert.  The image is a bit grainy and would be better in a higher resolution, and the words on the top and middle of the capacitor have also been covered with a red block which detracts from the original image, but overall it was a good purchase that I am happy with."
Beware that the manufacturer failed to account for the S6's 2.5D glass curvature at the edges. This screen protector extends at least 2mm into this curved area and you will see a cloudy 2mm line all the way around the perimeter. This is the glue basically spanning the gap between the ultra flat protector and phone's screen slope. A truly outstanding product would be one that followed the curve or accurately stopped where the curve begins. I am convinced flat glass protectors are not the way to go for the S6. Use a film type.
I got this for my daughter and her husband to take on vacation.  They used it on the beach and the sound was wonderful.  I paid for the one day delivery so they would have it by the time they left.  That extra one day delivery payment was well worth it.
"My 10 year old daughter just loves this watch.  Th only thing that was a little surprising was the size.  For being a youth watch, it's large."
"Fit and worked well, great price."
I use my Jaybird x BlueBuds Sports Headphones during cardio training in the gym.  I used these headphones for about a year with no problems. I do put these headphones thru the sweat ringer and they sound great!!!
"Fast shipping, worked great and had some instructions on charging too!  Thank you"
Heavy Duty Charger set. charges everything I have very well. I received a discount for leaving a review. I would but it again.
"I wanted the full 8 hour charge, didn't get it, even after charging a full day. Painful to me to wear, even though I tried all kinds of tips; also the way it curled around my outer ear was inflexible and hurtful. Maybe my ears are weird and I just got a bum battery, but returning for a different style."
"These headphones are decent. Short battery life, which is stated but still disappointing nonetheless. Only lasts me 2-3 good workouts before I have to recharge. Indicates battery is low about 5 minutes before the headphones die...real nice lol. Also having issues with bluetooth sporadically disconnecting every once in a while. Overall you get what you pay for, which was not much so I would still recommend. Just dont have your hopes up too high."
"Love the look but had to pay a jeweler to put it on.  Definitely not easy to do yourself, especially with old eyes."
"Fits  great, looks good, and seems to be as sturdy as similar cases such as Otterbox but far less expensive."
It's thing barely works I wouldn't recommend this to product. I gave this product a 2 because the light came on when I plugged it in.
Looks like a quality product. Designed well in terms of looks but the problem is it's a bit thick at the back in one spot and it's hard to pull the cards out.
"This is a clear. Great product, works with all devices and is reasonably priced. The grip works as described"
"Claimed all in one Gps For running, cycling, swimming and golf. Great when it actually works but frustrated by its lack of reliability. Difficulty syncing device. Frequently resets itself during the day on its own. Vibration feature stopped working, rendering the alarm feature useless."
"I'm really excited about this iphone 5s screen protector because it is the same kind that I bought at the phone store for over $25. In my opinion, these tempered glass screen protectors are far superior to the flimsy peel and stick ones that end up with bubbles underneath or peel off after a few months.  Touch screen works great through this screen protector. This is one solid piece that you lay down on your screen all at once. The kit comes with wipes, and easy instructions.  Works great with my iphone 5S. Very satisfied with this purchase."
The only thing I would have to say is I suggest that you go and get better rca cables because the ones they give you are garbage.
"This is one of my favorite Trent cases. The design is slim but robust and slides into pockets very easily. The back rubber is very shock resistant. For a non-waterproof case, it does a good job at repelling dust."
I put the iOttie on the dashboard of my newly-purchased Porsche for one weekend and it has permanently damaged the dashboard. This thing will destroy your car! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
Recharge slow.  Not enough power to charge my cell phone.
"Looked nice,  but did not fit my 6plus LifeProof case!"
"I fix iPhones as a little side job and recommend they buy your screens but lately I've been telling them different. Your screens come in perfect condition but the gram attached to the glass comes apart very easily and shows light coming from inside the phone. This can be frustrating because there is no way to attach the plastic back to the glass, please take this into consideration when making new screens."
great case.  being on a farm i have no worries when it comes to keeping my phone safe.  it is harder to hear when talking to anyone but i just put it on speaker phone and problem solved
"Had it for almost 2 months, noticed after a month it got a huge air bubble on the bottom left, right on the corner. I guess it lost it's stickiness. Then just today it got scratches a butt ton from my iphone case. So much for anti-scratch. For the price it's fine. But I wouldn't pay full price for it."
I like the look and durability but don't like that you cannot login with the thumb and it covers the back camera
"Love this case. It's thin, attractive, rugged... better than the first version I got from Spigen.<br />The S5 gets a bit warm from the CPU sometimes, but this case is easily removed if needed.<br />I run A LOT... this fits into the armband including the case!<br />There's a lip this protrudes ever so slightly around the glass to lift and protect it... the case is sharp and professional looking. The rubberized corner and end pieces don't mark up and don't impede the fiction of any charge or earphone jack... the camera and the finger heart beat sensor work perfectly... in fact, the finger heartbeat sensor are easier to align now!"
1 week in. Quality feels excellent for $. This has 3 card slots and the cash pocket so be aware. I hope the 6s+ case is of equal or better design.
"I work at a factory, operating fork trucks and tuggers, and I needed something to protect my phone in case of a drop. I believe I bought the right case for the job.<br /><br />About a day in using the product, my phone accidentally fell down the stairs in my home landing on the hardwood floor. It must have hit the steps around 3 or 4 times. Upon inspecting the phone, both case and phone were scuff free. What a relief.<br /><br />My only complaint with this case is my phone came with one of the glassy screen protectors, and the film on the case isn't plush with the screen. It makes it so little things can get into the hole where the home button is (like sand or dirt) and you have to be firm with your touch to get to the touch screen. I also would like a white version of the case to match my white phone, but oh well."
"I really like that there is a bit of side and corner protection. The main attraction for me was the amount of angles once could use the tablet in. Aside from the 3 indentations, you can also fold a cover in for 2 additional viewing angles. I could care less the magnetic strip used for the auto-wake function and quick opening/closing but it's a neat feature for those who want it. I've had my case for over a year and it still works and looks just like new."
"I've used this dashcam for a couple of weeks now and while the camera itself is great, the power adapter that comes with it is so unshielded that it actually interferes with the FM radio in my car.  I've tried moving the cable around and other solutions but no matter what I try as soon as I plug the adapter to the camera or any device, it immediately kills my radio reception across multiple frequencies.  I switched to using a different USB car power adapter and the interference went away, so it's definitely the adapter that came with the camera."
Husband loves it.  He ordered this to replace his current one that has too scratched of lens.
I used it for two years and loved it. Now my 12 yr old son is using it. Worth the money!
I wonder what phone actually fits in-between the steering wheel mines didn't (iphone 6/ Mazda 2)
It did not fit my iPhone 6.  Shipping cost too much to return it considering what it cost.  Now out of money and can't use it.
Nice comfortable set of phones...great stereo sound...customer service is fantastic...My pair were delivered damaged and I got a replacement in two days.
This case is amazing! It's slim but sturdy. It doesn't add bulk to my phone at all. The rubberized egdes wrap around the lip of the phone and protects the front edges nicely and provide a good grip while holding the phone. Will definately purchase more! :)
"(+) Awesome performance as expected.<br />(+) Zen UI very user-friendly and highly customizeable.<br />(+) All bloatware uninstallable<br />(+) Camera flash powerful<br />(+) Good grip for a big phone - Due to the thought behind the design.<br /><br />(-) Removing the back panel for the first time is tough - google-in on how to, there is a method.<br />(-) Power hardware button not responsive - But thank you touch screen double tap on.<br />(-) Camera not great, but ok - SW tries to fix the HW limitations<br />(-) Screen colors are not very bright. - not a major concern as its easy on my eyes<br />(-) No original back panels sold separately - thus far.<br />(-) Fast charge heats the battery. Worried that it will make the overall battery's life span less as its abused by heat - I use my husbands regular Sony charger occasionally.<br />(-) Weak speaker."
Saved my iPod!!  It is NOT for the week hearted but it does work great.  Tool failed when used.  The battery did not last 6 months!  I am not impressed!!
The picture is ok but I knew it wasn't going to be the best before I bought it. For the price it was worth it.
"Best investment I made in recent trip to Scotland. It gave me a single point to recharge our phones, pads, reader, and toothbrush! A real life saver."
Very dissatisfied. The car charger has ready become defective and it's only a few days past 30days so I'm unable to return.
"I have had these headphones for over a week now and I can say that I like them.  This is my first pair of bluetooth earphones so I was very excited when I received my item.  The packaging is AMAZING.  Honestly, this is one of the best shipments I have ever received as far as packaging.Upon opening the box, I immediately tested the product out.  It is very simple to sync to my iphone, and fits well in my ears.  Turning on and off is simple too with its audio commands.  I have since used them while at work, as well while I cut my grass.  They stay in place, there is not a long cord connecting me to a phone, and the charge life on mine is sufficient for my need.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for an unbiased review."
"Very good charger, so good I purchased another one. I have the Galaxy S4 with 7500 zerolemon battery and charger works flawlessly."
Charges quickly but the light on the end is too sensitive. If I use my phone while plugged in it shines in my eyes
the lights for caps lock and num lock were broke when i got it out of the box wasn't very happy.
"[[VIDEOID:4a3c457c525011e8a0c9f3ed4929278]]I am extremely hard on my Iphone. If it's not being dropped on the ground it's being sat on! I am forever dropping my phone, always trying to carry to many things at once and my phone gets the grunt of it. So I NEED a good protective case ALL THE TIME. When this came up for review- yup- I wanted in. It arrived and I so loved my color choice. It comes in so many color choices that there's a perfect color choice for everyone. But the Lime Green and Grey is the BEST in my humble opinion. The case has multiple layers, a plastic protective screen cover, a silicone cover and a hard case. The combination of the three makes this a really durable case. I originally thought it would be bulky but I was proven wrong. It's nice and sleek. My wireless wasn't interfered with either and the case has what I call a kick stand. I can prop up my phone to watch movies or videos.  Talk about convenience! Overall I honestly like this case. I did drop my phone- Shock right? It bounced. My phone is still working just fine waiting to take all the future abuse poor lil `ole me can give it.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR"
"Didn't last very long.  I would've liked to have gotten a year out of it at least.  I know I can be rough on these cords, but I'm not that rough."
Love this phone case! Fits perfectly on my iPhone 6 plus. Got here in less than a week. Nice packaging!!
It looks great at first but was broke soon within a month. What is the use of it if it breaks without dropping the phone? I did not even carry it everyday so I was very disappointed by the poor quality. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money.
This cord was torn when it arrived. My husband and I waited a month to receive the cord. We had to throw it away
It works well but it is made rather cheaply and the front plastic clear cap falls of a lot also there is not much space between the two ports making a little difficult to plug in two devices at a time but other then that I loved the product.
Had two of the lime green color stands sent to me that had manufacturer defects. JETech has been great about making sure I was satisfied and sent me the updated version and it works great. The craftsmanship of the updated version is miles ahead of the old version.
"Good case, needs more space for cards."
As everyone else has noted the holes dont line up for the corner brackets. Its not worth the cost of returning but hey it was a $15 screen so what are you going to do? Personally I installed it and redrilled the holes to make the piece work.
It is my first time to have a case from Spigen and I like the  sleek design of the case. It really protected my cellphone.
Excelent. The only one problem i have with it is that it last too much to charge.. but its 10k mah how not?
"Good headphones, easy delivery, esay to use. The only bad thing is there is no other earplugs to accomodate your ear .. what you see is what you get, also it comes with a separate plastic cover to use I guess when you using them so sweat doesnt get to the buttons but it doesnt make it easier to use. It also used to disconnect out of nowhere..  not a good buy"
"High Quality digitizer worked well on my kids iPad. With a help of Youtube video, i was able to repair this on my own."
Itemas described! Works Great!
"Just so happy with this case. I've only ever bought one other case, but it wasn't as great as this one. I drop my phone regularly and it just bounces, unscathed. The kickstand is handy."
"Works wonderful, takes great pictures in the case. Phone calls are clear. Only negitive is that i find it hard to open."
"I have had no problems with this case and recommend it highly.  It fits great and protects well enough that falling off a car roof at 25mph and tumbling on the road a bit did not cause any damage to my, er, my friend's phone.  Yeah, that's it.  My friend."
"Great product but after couple weeks stopped working. I Kept it in perfect condition also. No sweating , no drops , no water and still stopped working. Cheap quality. DO NOT BUY!"
it has been about 3 months and it still works but the plastic cover is coming off at the lightening end. I think it is the begining of the issue and it is going to stop working soon. I am going to give it another month and return it. I will update in a month with what happens.
"this is a great product, i received a discount on my order for a fair review,<br />its made very well."
Very cute case. My daughter loves the princess in her iphone. So far the case is being sturdy and doing it's  job.
Handle did not correctly line up with button once opened. You get what you pay for.
"Cute case, make sure you get a screen cover for the front of the phone. I like the stand but don't like that it can only stand one way. Makes it easier to watch videos on my phone without holding it"
"Music  sounds clear but about two weeks into using  the there was some crackling  that happen  twice  a couple  days apart iv only had the about 4 weeks now and it's only  happened twice. Possibly  bad connection  for what ever reason,  I am using  a galaxy 4  phone  my range away from my phone is about 40 ft  the only other real issue  other than the crackling  that has only happened twice is that at times I have to keep readjusting them in my ear because they fall out now this my be an issue with my ear shape but over all I really  like them as long as the crackling doesn't  continue  I am a firefight is south Georgia and wear  these when I train so the heat and sweat play a factor in keeping them snug in my ear . However  they do not drawn out background  noise  too good  but the music is very  clear so you still hear your beats very good but can also distinguish other noises  which is a good thing when I'm listening  for an emergency  dispatch as well.  Over all a month into having them I feel the money was well spent ."
the waterproof case works underwater I did the test that it said to do that worked great but on my case the part that opens and closes for you to charge your phone broke just two weeks after I put it on my phone so now it's no longer waterproof  I think it hey need to fix that one part or make its just the that was sent to me all in all the case does it job
Color is dull/ugly in person. Almost looks like plastic. Can only fit 5 cards comfortably. Hole for stylus access is sharp and uncomfortable.
"This is such an amazing case not only does it look awesome it protects my phone 100%. It comes in three layers the first is made of rubber which fits perfectly over my phone. The case doesn't stretch like most rubber cases and it keeps my phone in place (and trust me I've already dropped out a few times and my phone didn't get any damage or fall out. The next layer is plastic and has a stand for easy no hands access which is great when I'm watching videos, cooking, or playing music without muffling the sound. And then there is the plastic case with a clip that I fit on my pants so I can have it easily accessible for when I'm at work. So if I'm not wearing pockets I still can have my phone on me and again it was made to stay in place and not slip or fall off! Every piece was built with high quality materials for durability and ultimate protection. I absolutely love my phone case and you will too! I received this product at a discounted rate for an unbiased review."
"The holder is robust and keep my phone in place, also very easy to remove."
Case worked great unless you took pics with flash on then you would get green hue on all pictures.
"Great product , works awesome in the right station"
this case it was delivered four days later then expect. it's tight and it really doesn't fit my phone when I put it on it takes the back off of my phone. I hate this case. It took so long I just went the the place I bought my phone n bought on for 20$ it's nicer and I needed one asap. This is crap and I don't recommend.
"[iOS] Right out of the packaging the Bluetooth connection was efficient and easy.  Works exactly as advertised when using the iOS camera app, without any additional apps needed.  You press the button and it fires the shutter.  I've taken a few dozen shots with no glitches.  It doesn't trigger my Camera+ app however, although I haven't installed any CamKix apps to bridge that process.  Durability of the fob is probably adequate, but it's not something I'd want to drop too many times or step on."
The car charger never worked.
"I loved the quick service and the headset.  It is very comfortable to wear and easy to operate.  I haven't really had an opportunity to assess the sound quality, but will write another review to share my opinion."
"UPDATE 10/9/15 - I emailed Gear Beast Customer Service after they left a comment on this review.  They apologized for Amazon's old stock and offered to replace my arm band with no extra cost or effort on my part.  The replacement does support an iPhone 6 Plus comfortably.  I have updated my review from 2 Stars to 4 Stars and applaud the Customer Service I received from Gear Beast.  They definitely stand by their customers.  I saw reviewer complaints that the cutouts for the iPhone 6 Plus were on the wrong side, but I also saw the company reply to those comments saying the issue had been fixed.  The one that immediately comes to mind was dated October 2014.  Based on this, I purchased the item for my iPhone 6 Plus, assuming the issue was resolved.  Well, either the company lied about the issue being fixed, or I got some seriously old inventory.  My item, received July 2015, had the cutout on the wrong side.  The phone fits, but I have to leave the end flap open in order to plug in the headphones.  It works fine while walking (I just position the open flap facing upwards so the phone doesn't slip out the bottom), but I'm not sure if this will hold up to running.  Unfortunately, I discovered this too late to return the item.  I'm pretty disappointed that the company is still sending out defective products.  Item is otherwise comfortable, so I'll give it 2 stars for that alone."
"This is a great and affordable case! I have kept one of these on my phone since my $50 Otter Box only lasted a few months before breaking. I am working on my second case since the first one only lasted a few months before it needed to be replaced. I would highly recommend giving it a try, replacing a $9 case after 4 months is so much better than replacing a $50 one. It will not last forever, but you will get your money out of it and it protects your phone great. My phone has been dropped countless times and held up. My advice is to keep only one card per slot to not stretch out the slots. That is what keeps happening to mine."
I love this battery. It works great holding a charge longer then the original battery. Gives me more time to play games on my phone. This would also be a great back up battery incase you run out of power on the go. Using this as the primary battery in my Galaxy S III for 9 months so far and have only ran out of power a couple of days. A few times forgot to charge my phone at night or I was playing games on my phone between classes and drained my battery.
This is what I need. It looks small but fit the charger. White color very pretty. Thanks.
"THIS IS REAL NICE HOLDS YOUR CELL PHONE ON THE VENT VERY EASY TO MOUNT . REQUIRE VERY LITTLE ASSEMBLING . NOT LIKE A LOT OF THEM YOU GET AND HAVE TO PUT ON DASH AND THEN THE STUFF USED IS STUCK UNTIL YOU FIND SOMETHING TO TAKE IT OFF WITH . THIS IS VERY PORTABLE YOU CAN PUT IT IN ANY VEHICLE . I PURCHASED THIS CAR MOUNT AT A REDUCED PRICE AN EXCHANGE FOR A TRUTHFUL AND UNBIASED REVIEW .[[ASIN:B00QAXY27S Car Mount, Nexcon Magnetic Cradle-less Universal Car Phone Air vent Mount Holder for iPhone 6, 6 plus, 5, 5s, 4, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge S5 S4 S3 Note 4 3, HTC M9 M8, LG G4, G3, Black]]"
"this case for the price is amazing. Nice firm rubber, great color I feel its gonna hold up awhile. my only issue now is I need a belt clip for it."
He picture was cool but the phone case looked nothing like the picture. It was screen printed on there and all stretched out like there was no effort involved putting it together. Don't waste your money.
Cheaply made.  Only good as a short term fill in product.
"Amazing amp for the money.  Originally had it hooked up to the shallow 10&#34; pioneer sub, now I'm running a JL 13w6 and it still powers it like a champ.  Haven't had any problems what so ever."
"ok , Do i see a difference from this model in comparison with the regular UV5RA nope. feels the same quality is the same maybe the internals are different but i can't notice them overall i really love the brand Solid product!"
"I purchased his case for my 11 year daughter. She tends to be a bit rough with her electronics so this case was perfect for her. It's quite sturdy however, it came with a clip back to it and the phone in the case doesn't even fit in it. I'm not sure if it was randomly thrown into my order or not but it's rather useless-hence the 4 star."
"This Tracfme is evetything advertised and ecverything I wanted. I have no use for a smartphone. Activatiion was no problem and adding minutes was quick and easy. My wife saw it and played around with it a bit, thin asked mi to order one exactly the same to replace her contract phone. Very intuitive."
I could never get this item to work and i didn't use it until after 30 return policy expired lesson learned always test product immediately.
"Great, cheap case. Def get this is you are on the fence but want to save money. This case has kept my wife's 6+ safe from a toddler for a year now. The only drawback is the strange plastic covering over the passcode ID button. It wrinkles and warps a bit so using this would not be possible."
Pretty good for a cheap little case. Doesn't protect much but it was more for looks than protection. The pink is a litttttle but more dark than in the picture but I think it's because in the picture it's on the white phone and mine is gray.
It works as advertising.
"This headset is an excellent product especially for the price.  It was a little tricky at first getting the bluetooth to connect but once connected, the headset worked like a charm.  I use my mobile phone as my work phone and this headset makes it sound like I am on my handset and it does have decent amount of noise cancelling.  I would definitely recommend this wireless headset."
"great headphones for the price! I bought them because my similarly priced Sony's were wearing out, and those don't cancel noise half as well. I think the black looks nicer on second thought, but the white ones give me no problems"
"I had a lifeproof case for my iphone 5 before I got the iphone 6, and I figured that I could try using a different waterproof case that wasn't as expensive as lifeproof for my new phone. Well I loved the color, and the package came in a day earlier than expected but when I did the waterproof test, I found that water actually got inside the case. Also, the notch where you can turn the volume on/off doesn't move on the case, and it was very hard to separate. So now I don't even use the case anymore. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Only used it for about a week. They work fine. They don't feel like the original apple cable, and you might find some measurement differences that are negligible: see the picture. But all in all they are worth the price and I am happy with them so far."
"The case is great, people can hear you speak, etc. it's a little heavy but you'd get use to it quickly. Lastly, the headphones port is hard to use with right angles beats wired earbuds. Otherwise it's totally perfect!"
The joint between the base and the arm doesn't have enough tension to hold my phone up. Because of this my phone ended up flopping around and flying out of the holder on several occasions. It could have easily taken a bad trajectory and landed screen first on a hard surface. I say use at your own risk...
This is a beautiful case that looks very elegant. I've had no issues with it and I would definitely recommend this brand to my friends.
This thing rocks.  Took two on a week-long trip inside Grand Canyon.  Charged all the Go-Pro cameras for the entire week.
"I've been using this case for about a year now.  I like the slim fit, which allows it to slid into my pocket easily.  The rubber is starting to get a little loose, so it might be time to email Otterbox about a replacement."
"This case feels great and fits tight. I immediately liked it when I put it on my note 4. Unfortunately the aluminum number cause my phone to go into 3G / no service fairly often. It also causes my wifi signal to sit around 1-2 bars max. I work for a cellular company and therefore understand when I am losing service due to an unrelated network issue. This case looks and feels amazing, but it is certainly not worth the loss in service."
"Very nice! I made a mistake and ordered the vase for s6 but needed s6 edge & the seller was great with getting right back to me & let me know they did have the case I wanted and would ship me the right case. It came right on time & my daughter loves it. It came with a screen protector, cloth, & stylus pen. The case really grips the phone perfect."
"An obvious upgrade to swap out a year and a half year battery, but no noticeable difference from the stock one when you first get it.  At the time this was cheaper and i would buy again."
"Would work better if your bike is quieter.  Even with 2, if you have loud pipes youre not hearing much of anything at highways speeds.  Not bad for putting around locally, especially for the $$"
"As a person that doesn't leave home without my Fitbit on my wrist, I don't think I could ever have enough bands for my Fitbit Flex.<br /><br />This is the second set of replacement bands that I have from this same company and I love them! These are plain colored bands, but they still look very nice and come in a variety of shades.  I find them comfy to wear, but I will say they run slightly smaller than the original bands that come with the Flex.<br /><br />I like that these close tightly, and feel very secure when I have them on. Even though they close tightly, I still I always make sure to add a clasp fastener for extra security and definitely recommend doing that. The Flex is a pricey little gadget and I like having all the extra security against losing it that I can get.<br /><br />I love being able to just grab whatever one suits my outfit or my mood and head out the door. I received some to review, and I can honestly say that I love them and wear these every single day."
"No mesh earpiece, lines on the screen after professional install.  Tried 3 times to verify installation but the next screen installed without issue - this was just a bad screen.  Good price, unfortunate experience."
Great product for a great price.
"Does a pretty good job of holding the phone.  Takes up a lot of room and the bracket doesn't have much adjustment for tilt.  Seems sturdy enough, but time will tell."
It was cute..n fit my phone just perfect...
Works great!  Use on in my truck for the kids to connect there gadgets and it has been working well.
Great emergency solar charger.
I love this case . The clock is beautiful and classy looking . The case is classy looking . I like very much that I can answer the phone or take pictures without opening the case . Can't say enough about it
"Orzly protective case for your smartphone<br />A smart, black, modern, light weight case, neatly packaged in a well designed box which visibly highlights the  benefits and suitability of the product.  Easy to open, no extra wasted packaging, simple and well thought through.<br />The box was accessorised with a small booklet containing Orzly products and other bits of interesting information.<br />The Orzly protective case has no buttons or zips but can be opened by simply lifting a magnetic tag, great for those without great manual dexterity!!<br />The inside case houses two pockets, great for credit cards or important bits of information without the need to carry extra wallets or purses around.  The smart phone can easily be slotted into the allocated pocket on the opposite side.<br />An ideal product for those who want a no messing, light weight product, an attractive elegant accessory for the smartphone!!"
Garbage.  Seller finally contacted me after the 4th email to them.  Amazon already refunded me 100 percent so I threw this thing in the trash.  What a waste of time
"Each cord is 10 foot long, so you have more than enough room to move around a little bit if you need too. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
I thought there would be a pair of these sent and it is only one ear piece for your right ear.
"I buy this case for every phone I get. Not sure why, but it's my absolute favorite case. No matter how many I try, I end up back with this one on."
"The cables that are provided with this batery doesn't work with my phone, so I have my own cable not the one original one. But other than that I works very well."
"Excellent phone, but overpriced here. Got mine (unlocked T-Mobile) at Bestbuy for $119.00. I hear they are very popular and folks can't keep them in stock. Maybe that why the price has gone up. Again, excellent phone.  Bought to replace my aging G3."
Very goo charger and works as promised charging quicker than other products I've tried.  Highly recommend.
"UNU supplied me with this product to evaluate & review here.  Like many review readers, I watch for freely offered merchandise, expecting an outstanding analysis because the reviewer wants more stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, the UNU SUPERAK portable battery is exceptionally nice.  It's 5000kmAh (milliamps - iPhone 6 carries 1,810mAh battery, by contrast the Samsung 6 Edge a 2600mAh, & the Samsung Note 4 a more substantive 3200mAh) capacity, at full charge, can theoretically &#34;recharge&#34; any of the phones mentioned above, some twice.  Chargers like this, whether Anker, a fine maker of portable batteries, or this UNO PORTAPAK, hold a charge a long time, weeks in fact without being topped off.  I like the small charger size, it slips into my back jeans pocket, but with a bulge in that it's 3,75&#34; long...but about an inch wide.  It's more an issue for jeans pockets than a suit coat or purse. Great size in cold weather, multi-zippered coats.  I've already charged from near empty...my Samsung Note 3, and of four LEDs on chargers side (to suggests available charge), 3 of the 4 lamps were out.  That's not bad for the heavy 3200mAh Note 3 battery to filled.<br /><br />Here's the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;·sis·tance. The charging cord which comes with the battery has a standard USB male plug on one side, and a WONDERFUL &#34;piggy-back&#34; arrangement of MICRO USB (Android, etc.) with an attached LIGHTENING interface for someones iPhone. The two tips are attached by a small piece of plastic and always there in whatever flavour you require in the moment.  This feature alone is worth the savings in aggravation of 'whose got a micro cable??? NO...that's for my iPhone!!!.<br /><br />This is especially handy and offsets my uncertainty about charger shape. There is both a MICRO and STANDARD outlet on the end to allow powering and charging options of every sort/device.  This accompanying cord would have been wonderful were in somehow attached to the charger...eliminating the need to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.<br /><br />But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.<br /><br />If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!d to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.<br /><br />But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.<br /><br />If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!"
"Reliable, fits the car well and made a great mount! Well worth the money I paid for it, does the same job compared to others 3 times the price! It was a little bit hard getting it into the vent at first, but once it clicked, it didn't move anywhere."
This is the second jackery bar I purchased. I bought one previously for myself. This was a gift and they loved it!
"Cannot beat the price, though the screen is crap and the device can occasionally be sluggish."
"cheap I was very careful and it didn't last even one season of boating. closure fell apart. It did float, but just fell apart after awhile."
This is my second LUVVITT tempered glass screen cover. I dropped my phone (which is not in a fancy case just a rubber-y colored slip) face-first a few feet down onto a cement floor obviously my heart dropped when I picked up my phone and saw the shattered screen. I winced as a peeled off the screen cover but THANK THE PHONE GODS my screen was still perfect. I am a customer for life!<br /><br />Fits my Galaxy S5 Active perfectly.<br /><br />Easy to install. The kit comes with a lens cloth and cleaning wipe. Try to line everything up the first time. My first attempt at applying the screen it attached a little skewed and I peeled it off to re-attach. The corner I used to peel the screen protector off had a air pocket under it for the remainder of the time it was on my phone but the screen protector stayed secure for 5 months until today when I replaced it.
although copied well tech content was poor; sound and transmission ranked between static and broken morse code. Poor Motorola model
Delivered on time. Works much better than the junk ones for $5.
"The phone itself fits my phone perfect, but the picture on it isn't the best. You can see the lines from the printer and it's not as clear as I was hoping for."
"Cords are exactly as advertised, and truly are the perfect size for the DJI Inspire 1 with the factory device mount and the iPad Air 2! A++"
Not as advertised.<br /><br />Featured/Sold as &#34;Like New&#34; . Arrived with loose Bezel. Arrived with cheap (Non_Garmin) car power supply that lasted all of one week.  I had to buy a separate car charger to keep it working.<br /><br />The product works but has irritating bias in the on-screen buttons.<br /><br />I would rate this product as &#34;fair&#34; definitely not &#34;like New&#34;
"Great, bought it for my wife and she loves it. Only down side is the cord it comes with to allow for charging does not fit her iphone 5 (or my 4 for that matter) maybe it is a plug for the iphone 6. Great overall."
This is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to everyone.  I recieved a promo code for a fair review
"While this case may look stunning and come with a stylus, it's texture feels cheap and it had a distressed look within a week from just every day use. The stylus broke the first day I had it, but that probably could have been avoided. Overall it's decent for the price, but if you're looking for something cute AND durable, look elsewhere."
Delivery was as promised. Charger has been working great.
good product i only use the sensor alarm the siren is very loud it will surely make attention if someone will try to take your bike.
Works and good quality.
Awesome :)
"Before ordering this product, I have been using an otter box for many years.  The only draw back about otter box is that the rubber would stretch out overtime and there would be difficulty latching onto the belt clip at the two points on the side.  What I like about the Buddibox is the rubbery feeling that provides a nice grip and the area that latches onto the belt clip is hard plastic.  The draw back about this project is that after using it for about a month, the belt clip broke."
"Works well, great price. Delivered quick"
"The LUVVITT® ULTRA ARMOR iPhone 6S Case iPhone 6 case is an awesome case. After having this case for several months, these are the things I have come to find:<br /><br />Fit - 10/10<br />My iPhone 6 fits snugly into the TPU core case. All of the buttons are aligned perfectly onto the case and are immediately accessible should you need to adjust the volume or lock your phone. The hard shell case, which is the outer portion of the case, adds some an additional layer of protection  and fits nicely over the TPU case.<br /><br />Protection - 10/10<br />I personally found the case to be very effective in protecting my phone against my careless/abusive behavior. I'm the type of guy who would throw the phone onto the table immediately after coming home from a long day of work. Not only has it withstood my abuse, but it has also proved its durability against numerous drops. My phone still remains in mint condition, without any scratches, dents, or cracks.<br /><br />Look - 9/10<br />I love the way it looks, and I think its awesome that they provide you multiple colors to choose from. The look is simple and sleek. Not much design on the product, so it might not be for people who like cutesy, flashy phone cases.<br /><br />Price - 11/10<br />For 10 bucks, this thing is easily worth the investment. I normally skimp out on buying any form of protection when it comes to phones, but with these costing an arm and a leg these days, i thought it would be wise to get some sort of case for my phone. I'm glad I went with this case.<br /><br />Overall, this case has proven to be worth the investment. It has kept my phone in pristine condition over the past 7 months and I couldnt be happier. For $10, its hard to beat!"
"This case fits my phone like a glove.  The cutouts for the buttons are perfectly lined up.  It is a little difficult to get off, but if it was loose it wouldn't fit correctly.  I love the pop of color that it gives my phone!  Shipping was quick and easy.  Perfect transaction all around!  Two thumbs up!<br /><br />I received this product as a free sample for my unbiased opinion."
I ordered one and it didn't work BUT RAVPower was so great about the whole experience and I couldn't be happier with the product I have now.  Recommend.
I used the screen for 4 months and it's great. The only thing sometimes the left bottom corner doesn't respond properly.<br />I broke my phone again so I will order another one again.
With the redesign in the Galaxy 5 charging port it can be difficult to get the phone to sit but it does hold the phone upright and does charge once the phone is properly connected
"The microphone port doesn't work, no one can hear me talk to them. other than that the case is very nice."
"I have received it,  at first it fitted my phone and it looked nice however after using my phone for 7 hours i recognized that the touch quality became unfortunately ridiculous and i need to press and hold every button like old phones which made me removed it,  so i paid for two screen protectors and i will not use them."
I purchased this for my sister for Christmas last year and she loved it so much that I bought it for my son this month.  He especially<br />likes the feature that is a split screen for inner city driving.  It tells you what lane to be and how long until you have to get off the<br />exit ramp.  It makes driving so much easier in heavy traffic when you never know when it is time to exit.  I also like the posted<br />speed limit feature that turns red when you are speeding. This also has lifetime updates on maps.  This is very important if you use<br />the unit often.  My son uses it daily and has thanked me repeatedly.  Great gift idea.  Best GPS on them market!
This is a very nice heavy charger that two items can be charged at once. This Iflash ISB charger is very sturdy product.  I have bought my share of flimsy car chargers and this one sure looks and feels expensive. My ISB fit smoothly and easily into the slot.  I was given the chance to test this item for an honest opinion.  This is a very nice charger and I am please with the quality.
"Barely fits the Nexus 6 in a &#34;SUPCASE Premium Hybrid Bumper Case&#34;, but managed to get it to hold on. Once it's ready, the VR effects are pretty decent, no cross-talk issues at all.<br /><br />Aside from the Nexus 6 in a case barely fitting, what the cardboard makes you realize is that 1440p is still not high resolution enough as you can easily see pixels on the screen :(<br /><br />Using the headstrap will make your nose feel uncomfortable, rubbing against cardboard (literally); you'll want some kind of gel to pad the nose area."
"This case is for people who want a regular case with a stand. Personally, I dislike wallet-style cases, but I need to be able to prop up my phone. This case solved my problems. A few considerations:<br /><br />1. The stand is easy to use, and seems quite sturdy. I don't expect it to fall off or break somehow.<br />2. The case itself is sturdy. It makes the phone feel bigger but that's to be expected.<br /><br />This is a great hybrid between a regular case and wallet case. I was given this case for my objective evaluation."
rear facing camera will not work I have had 2 replacements and the camera works for a while then it stops
"Great little speaker with a powerful sound especially for the cost.  The only thing I'd like more is if it had a longer battery life before needed to be recharged.  Overall, I'm very satisfied."
Not the right protector for the l u step phone :(
"A great device. Elegant, faster, good battery life. Recommended as a mid range phone, yes. Absolutely."
This is a great wireless speaker. I purchased it for my flowershop. I liked the durability of it and knew it would last. The sound is really awesome and it is compact so it fits any where.
"I bought this for my LG G4 with tempered glass screen protector. It feels sturdy and grips decently, but I noticed that only one half of the lip prevented the screen from touching the floor when inverted. This would've been great without a screen protector."
I bought these 2 pack a couple of months ago. When I received it only 1 was working good. Anker customer service being as Great as they are reimbursed me half for the inconvenience.<br /><br />I say it is a good product all around (compared to others on the market) Tho not the best.<br /><br />The 1 product is still working good no complaints. I would recommend this to others for the price.<br /><br />My rating is as follows:<br />5 stars for Anker customer service.<br />3 stars for the (1 working product I received)<br /><br />For an overall rating of 4 stars!!!
"Selfie I love taking pictures wherever I go and I’m glad that I got this selfie stick from Kengadget. There are a lot of selfie sticks out there but for me, by far this product stands out.  It looks more modern and sleek and also it is very well made. I have an Android phone and I did not have any problems pairing my Bluetooth with it. It’s lightweight and so convenient to use. You just have to turn it on, connect your phone with it, flash your perfect smile and click the button to take a picture. I love that it holds up your phone securely and also it has a wrist strap just to secure it in your wrist if you are clumsy like me.  You can extend it just enough to get a perfect group picture or even a nice view. Now I’m looking forward to our next vacation because this selfie stick will surely help in capturing every nice moment perfectly. Disclaimer: I received this as a complimentary product in exchange of my fair feedback."
"Nice slim case but durable material. Has good coverage, extra protection on the corners, but is not bulky at all. Plus the blue dot design hides the flaws/scratches my last clear cover created (not by E LV) but still has clear look that I wanted. With new screen protector my phone looks brand new again!"
"Love the look but disappointed.  Thin plastic hard shell cracked along volume buttons within first week after one fall off my lap and onto the floor.  My phone is fine so I guess it did its job, but I would expect more resiliency from a case claiming to be so protective."
"If there is one accessory that I think all mobile users should have it’s a USB charger for their car. I personally have three that I keep in my car for various road trips. The first adapter I had only had one port. It was very helpful, but as the need has grown for more ports and more power behind it, so has the market for car chargers. Accessory designer, TYLT, has come up with a rather unique device, the Y-CHARGE [QUIK] Car Charger. It’s a charger that is designed to push more power out to larger devices. For example, the Y-Charge [QUIK] has a 4.7A high powered output. That’s enough power to charge two tablets at their maximum rate. In addition to that, devices that support QuickCharge will charge up to 75% faster than with other chargers.<br /><br />The Y-Charge [QUIK] is also a ‘smart’ charging device. This is a newer class of products that senses your device’s power needs. The charger will then provide the maximum charging rate that is designed to charge your device with. This is very helpful as you don’t have to worry about overcharging or inserting your device’s USB cable into the wrong port.<br />I’ve been a fan of TYLT for quite some time now and have owned many different car chargers. But, I’ve never seen one with such a unique design. As the name suggests, the charger is a ‘Y’. The power adapter end that goes into the cigarette lighter is just a bit longer than most of the other chargers I’ve used. It’s ‘Y’ junction splits into two ports for USB charging. I’ve used other TYLY USB Charging products and found them to be of greater strength that other chargers in the same class and feel that the Y-Charge [QUIK] is no different.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this special charger is its size. And, this may just be because of my usage, but my main cigarette lighter sits just in front of one of my drink holders. Any time I am charging something, it gets in the way of a drink that needs to sit in that holder. This is a very minor issue, but one I felt I needed to address as others might have the same consideration.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful product with a very unique design.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

Radio lasted 2 days and volume control was lost. Radio would be all the way up or all the way down no in between.
"I was use to a Samsung S4 so I thought they would be the same since they both work with Android. Unfortunately that was not the case. Over all it works but if u have ever used a Samsung, keep it! Also camera is horrible! And the oops protection takes forever to get new phone."
"Nice case - simple, clean and lightweight. It fits the phone very securely, and I haven't noticed that the case hinders the use of any of the controls.  If you are looking for a clear case for your device, this one is very good!"
"Great price, fast shipping, product was as advertised. Charger works well for my battery. I will recommend this charger to my friends. Thanks again!"
Absolutely beautiful!  My Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 fits perfectly.
"I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion. There are a few things I like about this product one is the digital screen that lets you know the state of your cars battery voltage and how much power is being supplied to your device while it's charging. The other thing that is cool is the head of the device can be maneuvered a little once it is completely plugged in.<br />I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, the speed is not super fast but from 0% battery it can get a full charge  within 1hr30mins - to - 2hrs. It has dual usb ports so you can charge 2 devices at the same time but I only used it for my phone but it is handy to have. When the car is off there is less voltage, so while the car is running it may increase the speed of the charge a little. I would recommend this product if you are concerned about the state of your cars battery."
"When I read some of the other reviews, I was worried that the firmware updates might cause some issues for me.  I bought four of these to control the outside lights on my house, and they have been working great for more than a month now.  I think that Belkin has resolved the firmware issues other reviewers talked about, and I have even had them go through a second update (after the initial one that ran at installation) without any issues.  I have had to restart a few of the switches in order to make them reconnect to my router after I changed some settings, but otherwise they have worked very well.  If you are looking for a solid system to begin connecting you lights to your network, these are a great choice.  The added bonus is they are very easy to set up with Amazon Echo.  I simply logged into my Echo app, and built a group with all of my outside lights.  I can easily turn them on or off as a group from my iPhone or by asking Alexa to take care of it for me.  Definitely a step into the future!"
Slim and unassuming.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Not the most protective but it works for my needs since the 6 plus is such a big phone.
This is my third battery (and largest) from Anker.  This battery is very well-made.  It does have a little bit of weight to it but that makes it feels very solid.  Seems to never run out of power.  So far I am very satisfied with this battery and highly recommend it.
"Pretty satisfied. Dented the thing with a couple of drops--one between the slats of picnic table right onto concrete (about 28 inches drop, I'd guess). No damage to the phone, so the case did its job as expected. The bulk added is noticeable over the naked phone, but still less bulky than many cases on the market it seems, and the level of protection so far is excellent.<br /><br />The only little quibble: The speaker grill has a thin piece separating two openings to the speaker. This sticks out, and therefore has worn off, revealing a silver/white color underneath. Not sure why they added the ridge, maybe to allow sound out when the phone sits flat? It seems like this same wear will eventually happen to the whole case, but replacing it (maybe refreshing in a new color?) down the line is better than replacing or repairing the phone, obviously"
"I am very sorry I purchased the Nuvi 56 LMT.  The screen glare often reduces the unit to a listen only GPS .If you go on the internet you will see many anti glare hoods being offered to try to fix the problem.  Regretfully I was unaware that such a problem existed.<br />Many common words are mispronounced, e.g. bridge is pronounced as badge  and some street names are so badly pronounced they are beyond recognition.  Unlike my older Garmin unit the Nuvi 56 sometimes has a time lag informing you of the next up coming street name.  This will happen if the distance between the streets is not long enough.  I will using my i Pad mini GPS.  I would not recommend this to anyone at any price."
Very disappointed.  Sometimes doesn't charge both (case & phone).  Sometimes it will not charge and have to remove case to charge iPhone and case separately.
"Love this! Only issue is if you have to take it off so if this is a case that you plan to take on and off, go with something else. But I would buy this again easily. It looks amazing, has protected my phone through countless drops and you can push all the buttons on your phone easily."
Excellent build quality. Nice thick cable. Should last a long time.  Honestly Skiva makes products with excellent quality and attention to detail. Everything from the packaging to the finish on the materials.  Never disappoints!
"Didn't pair or work right, took it in to best buy for help no luck  sent it back"
"I've tried several types of mini tripods in the past for phones and webcams and some of the real cheap one are so light and flimsy that they tip over when the wind blows or if you have a USB cable attached they'll just collapse at the slightest change in weight distribution.<br /><br />For this, I was originally looking for a tripod for my point-and-shoot camera and then saw this one that can also be used with my phone.  I haven't used the bluetooth remote feature, but as a tripod alone I feel that this one is plenty sturdy and will not fall over easily.<br /><br />There are probably other decent tripods for half the price I paid for this, but the value in this is it has a phone adapter included.  That being said, the price just went down $5.00 since I bought it! :)"
"I really love this product... Somehow I always had problems with this type headphones, but this ones fit perfectly, sound is amazing, it does stay when you run..."
Emergency iPhone power when you need it.  Nice size and weight.
"Do not order this case!!! It is beyond cheap and it looks like they took a picture of a real Kate spade phone case and blew it up to fit this case. The wording is faded, the product is terrible!!!!! So disappointed"
"Great price, quick service and fast delivery. Would order again."
"The tuner in this unit has never worked properly.  I have only been able to tune in 1 station cleanly.  Tech support had no options, other than take it to repair center.  Purchased this M303 along with a XC1410 amp, and both are defective.  The replacement amp has now failed, and again tech support/customer service has no option for me.  I will not be buying Clarion products ever again, poor quality and poor customer service."
"the phone was in visually excellent condition, but some how it went through refurbishment without being able to be charged. not very useful without power."
It is great for the kids in the back where there is only one power port.  With this they can charge their tablets or smart phones on the road.
DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF S***! THE BUTTON DOES NOT WORK ! (they have to be paying those people for good feed back) WARNING DO NOT BUY!  AFTER TAKING ONE PICTURE THE BUTTON STOPPED WORKING !
"These earbuds were definitely not the right fit for me.  I used these headphones for running, and I could not find the right combination of &#34;wings&#34;, in-ear pieces, and over/under ear positions to make the earbuds stay secure in my ear while doing so.  Besides the fit, pairing, sound, and battery life were all as described, and worked as expected."
"The belt clip is very cheaply made, I've had to order 5 replacement belt clips and won't be buying another"
I love my phone and was looking for a case that would be thin and allow me to stick my phone in my pocket without a lot of bulk or rubber sticking to my pants. This case is pretty (especially on my white phone) and fits perfectly. I'm happy with my purchase.
"Very, very disappointed. Since the beginning having problems with the door you use to charge thei cel. Hard time to keep it close and now it does not close. Looking forward to get my money back."
Love the sticker. Put it on my clip on case. Its peeling a little bit and I bought it in May (2015). Nothing a little Modge Podge cant fix.
"Don't get me wrong - I like the product so far. It works as indicated - charges the phone and acts as a battery backup for the phone. No problems so far there. But I give the 3 stars because of the email I received from NomadPlus, asking me how I like my product because &#34;your feedback helps us ensure a positive customer experience&#34;.<br /><br />My issue lies with Nomad because the final sentence of my email says, &#34;We love happy nomads, so if you have any questions or issues with your product, please email me at [e-mail address removed] and I'd be glad to help you.&#34;  So I received an email from 'Chloe', and she wants to help me if I have questions, yet there is no email address for me to contact 'Chloe'?!?! Ah, yes, so very helpful. Sorry Chloe (if that's your real name), but I just can't give you 5 stars because of your hollow attempt to ensure I am a happy nomad. Am I being petty? I guess, but don't pay me lip service with your feigned desire to ensure this nomad is happy."
"I bought 6 pairs of radios to use in my business, the radios are well built except for the belt clip, that is too small and easy to brake.<br />My biggest dissapointment is with the clarity of the voice, it is extremely hard to understand anything the other person is saying, much less with the surveillance headset PTT mic, I am really dissapinted with Motorola."
"I love the fact that this charger has 6 ports on it. Between tablets and cell phones, we just didn't have enough outlets in the kitchen where we wanted to charge all of our devices so they were easy to remember to grab on our way out of the house each morning. This guy does them all and only uses 1 wall outlet... and all 6 devices charge fast. I have a Charger Doctor device that displays the voltage and current being delivered by a USB port, and I've had the charger loaded up to where it is delivering more than 1 amp from each of the 6 ports (6 amps total) with no problems. I've recommended this to my family and I know they are going to love it as much as I do."
A little bulky so it's hard to fit in my pocket but it looks great and I don't have to worry about my phone getting beat up.
This smart watch worths its money. It makes the same things the other famous watches do. You can connect it via bluetooth with your mobile. It connected without a problem with s4. Receive and make calls.
"Due to over 30% of the bad reviews, I was really worried if I made the wrong decision on getting UP2. However, I really like the design of UP2, small, light weight, comfortable to wear and the features (include the app), which helps me to watch my daily activities and hit my exercise goals. Many people complained it does not stay on the wrist well, but mine hasn't had this problem yet. Only one thing needs to be aware, but not a big deal, it sync with my phone every few minutes,so drains the battery really fast. In overall, it is a good tracker worth to give it a try!"
had no glue to stick sucks dont buy
This is hands down the best glass Protection for an iPhone. I have been using this glass protection for about 2 years. You can't beat the cost or the protection quality ... Great Job...
This wristlet is super useful if you're going out with just a phone and your id/credit cards because it's super tiny and you can literally fit it in a pocket or just have it around your wrist.
This things junk! The picker quality sucks! The play the time back doesn't work half the time. The GPS cable  comes out all the time. And it died after three months of us.
"Wish the connector plug was three inches longer, as it sits behind the TV and is impossible to hit the sync button unless I move the TV.  Other than that, am pleased."
i bought this a while back....didnt use it much because everyone said it sounded tiny .......i used the mic on a baofeng and a wouxun
"Great device! It's everything I expected- Charges up well, charges my phone a few times on a charge, and although slower, the wireless charging works well, even though any case I've tried; but here's the caveat probably specific to my device, Sony Xperia Z3v: Because of the angle of the charger, my phone slides down to a point that it stops charging, only if it is bare with no case or protector. So for the wireless charging to work on a Sony Xperia Z3v, it must at least have a clear protector on it's back, or a case. I guess the tempered glass is too smooth for the rubber of the charger to grip. For this reason, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, because my device was specifically shown in the listing, but will not wireless charge in it's oem form (without a case or protector)."
"Not what I expected, waste of money"
"Great deal.  Purchased 3.  Only possible negative is that when running, slight rattle coming from the volume button.  Other than that, great sound."
"I love to change cases frequently and I am very picky about my phone cases. I like them to be thin not bulky. I received the Fab Quality Clear Galaxy S6 Case. I love it. !!<br /><br />So easy to put on and it fits nice and snug with my phone. I like that you can see my phone back and nothing is covered. It is so thin and makes my phone look as if it has no case on it. It is comfortable to grip, it does not feel slippery. I have had others that were for a iPhone 6 and the quality  was not as good. This is strong yet flexible. Precise Design Allows Easy Access to All Ports, Sensors, Speakers, Cameras and All Galaxy S6 Features. Designed Specifically for Samsung Galaxy S6 2015.<br /><br />I will be using this case for a long time because it is so comfortable. I received this case complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own."
DISAPPOINTED!!<br /><br />Was glad to receive it the day before my trip. Very disappointed because it didn't charge my phone at all though it was plug in the whole day 😕. Tried to switch from both output but still not working. Going to return it!
I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />This case seems very well constructed. It fits easily onto my phone and is very secure. It adds bulk to the phone comparable to any non-otterbox/lifeproof case.<br /><br />I would recommend this.
"This is very cute, but the bow kept falling off even though I super glued it back on several times."
I purchased this clock last year and it worked well but the phone charger broke so my son doesn't want to use the clock anymore.  The ringer isn't loud enough to wake him up and it's right next to him. I was optimistic about purchasing a clock with so many functions.  I went to the dollar store and bought a clock that only has an alarm that rings loud. No bells and whistles.
this one works perfectly where others have failed.<br />worth the extra cost.<br />good job monster cable for keeping the old tape decks usable.
Nice case and as advertised.  Rated four stars as one of my cables with a thicker end won't work on this case even though it worked on a different case which has since worn out.  Otherwise I'd rate five stars as this is a very nice product for the money.
"Pyramid BNPS102 10-Inch 1,000-Watt... It's ok  ... you get what you pay for this added nice bass  but it has a very flat range where it hits/sounds good  and some of the sub sounds dont even hit at all and the ones that do sound good so you will be listening to a song with a bass line and half of it it quiet  and the other half is way loud  and some beats dont sound right... i have them hooked up to a 1000w boss amp that was about $60 here on amazon...another bumming thing is they dont bump good at all  my honda stereo  goes from 1-40  and they only sound good around 1-13 ... some songs good up to 20  i have played with the amp a lot to try and get it to sound better but they just sound muddy and airy at high volume with hardly any hit  i even turned the amp almost all the way down and it becomes a bit cleaner sounding but it also sounds really weak like you dont have amps  just some really nice 6x9 rear speakers  that do decent bass for not being subs ... now if i only turn volume up to 13 and have the amp at about half power it sounds really nice with most songs aside from some bass lines being much quieter than others .. imo spend a little more and get quality subs like kicker or MTX  or rockford fosgate  or something decent"
"I was skeptical at first because of all the generally negative reviews about this mount.  People say it rattles around a lot while riding and they are worried that it might fall off their bike.  All I can say is that it hasn't happened to me yet.  I have the mount stuck to the back of my Lifeproof'd iPhone 6 plus which is basically like riding around with an iPad on your handle bar!  It seems to be working just fine.  After you lock your device into the mount it holds it pretty good,  there is a little slop but it's nothing major.  I ride 12-15 miles per day on paved bike trails, off road single track stuff, gravel roads etc... Point being I ride without a worry that my phone is going to fall off.  Follow the instructions about applying the adhesive and it will work like it's supposed to.  The mount itself hasn't moved from its original mounting position after about 140 miles of use.  I gave it 4 stars just because it is a little sloppy after its locked into place but like I said before it's not enough for me to be concerned.  Overall I am pretty happy with my purchase and I would recommend this mounting system to a friend."
Looks good and the reception is significantly better than the original stubby antenna.  No longer hitting every cement beam at work or the airport parking garages with the factory antenna.
"Good product,  we have this near yhe table seems that is where everyone ends up hanging out.  Its worked great so far.  Love little plug with the cord.<br />We use several size usb cords to reach everyone from 3 ,6 ,and a 10 foot one for the person at the end of table.  Seems someone is always needing to charge and this way no one has to play musical chairs to get near a charger. We just keep extra cords put in a little box ypu don't have cords all over the place all the time<br /><br />Im ordering another to put in my bedroom for my 3 devices."
When I press my button the outgoing beep is very loud so loud I have to take it off
"Worked great for 4 days. Then it wouldn't charge. Every time I tried to charge it, it would reset and just vibrate. Tried to contact the seller, but the language barrier made it all but impossible. Shipped on time and in good condition."
"I gave the unit five stars because it did what it claimed to do with one charge on this battery  I charged a cell phone with a 3200 mAh battery and a speaker and I did not deplete the battery, battery pack after the two charges had 62% charge remaining. The only comment I want to make is that the unit has an LED light but there are no instuctions on how to turn the light on, I found if you deprtess the power button twice the light turns on and off. I was sold the unit at a reduced cost for my feed back and if the unit did not live up to its expectation I would not have given it aa good review, however an un it with a battery of this size sells for three times as much in a cell phone store or other electronics retailer."
"This is a great little product. I also bought 3 cables when I purchased this charger, and I can charge my phone, backup battery, and bluetooth all at the same time. It's actually remarkably quick too. During my half hour commute, I can get a full charge on my bluetooth, 1/3 of a charge on my backup battery, and 3/4 of a charge on my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S4. Definitely recommend it. Great product, especially for the price."
"I ordered a 2 pack, but they sent me a 4 pack. No complaints here! My wife's phone is buggy and doesn't work with the cheaper cables, but these cables work great! I won't buy from any other source. These cables are a great price and feel sturdy."
Awesome case! protects the corners of the phone very well and the kickstand makes handsfree viewing easy.  Wish I hadn't of lost the holster!!
Garbage
The quality of the craftsmanship is stellar; my favorite part is the cabling along the cord which makes it so flexible. Works perfectly with my iPhone 5s
Had a very hard time getting the old one out and installing the new one it was really difficult even with the videos on youtube.
"Nice case, good looking, fits great. It's a little slicker than I suspected it would be but it is real wood and so I can take a fine grit sandpaper to give it texture. Fell off my nightstand and there's a crack in it now. Still functional, and it protected the phone perfectly. I'll have to get another at some point because it is cracked but, at this price it's worth it."
My phone fit perfectly into the wallet.  It looks sleek and neat. Would highly recommend.
I purchased several of these cords for my family. The cords are very sturdy. The length has become a plus when having an active child. He is always moving and really hard on electronics. This cords has held up really good.
"the volume button does not work properly. I'm unable to turn the volume up or done as the case and volume button don't seem to line up. Furthermore, I have to remove the prone from the case to charge it as the hole on the case is not the correct size. I have since stopped using the case."
"I bought one of these for my wife and one for myself back in May and I must say it has not been a good experience.  Our biggest gripe is that the Moto E is EXTREMELY slow.  It is hard to tell what the bottleneck is, but any level of multi-tasking will bring this phone to an absolute crawl.  I typically use Endomondo to track my walking and running while also listening to music stored on my phone with Google Music or streamed with Pandora.  So far I have not yet been able to run both apps without one or both crashing or the phone spontaneously rebooting.  If the phone is updating any of its apps, you might as well sit it down and walk away for a while because it will be mostly unresponsive until the updates are complete.  Switching between apps takes far longer than I would expect from any phone in 2015.  I have tried clearing cache and doing factory resets on both phones several times since we got them but have not seen any improvement in responsiveness.<br /><br />Another extremely annoying issue is that apps moved to the SD card are moved back to the internal storage when they are updated through Google Play.  So, if you plan on moving apps to the SD card in order to save space on the meager internal storage, be prepared to move your apps from internal to SD each time they update.<br /><br />The Moto E isn't all bad though.  The battery life is very good, there is virtually no bloatware and the built quality is very sturdy for a budget phone.  Motorola is also doing a great job keeping their devices on the latest stable version of Android.  I wish I could recommend the latest release of the Moto G over the Moto E, but it has the same CPU and memory bandwidth as the Moto E so I'm concerned that it might be a terrible multi-tasker as well.  I replaced our Moto Es with the Asus Zenfone 2 (purchased here on Amazon for $200) and found it to be a much better performer and better value overall than the Moto E.  Not a surprise really since the Zenfone's CPU is much fasterand it uses much faster RAM."
"Terrible design, the on/off button is on the side which is easily pushed on with a slight bump.. Very hard to carry in purse or pocket. Charge drains frequently w/ode because of this."
Grest product. Thanks!
Great charger and still works after a couple months unlike most non-Apple chargers. I will definitely buy again when the need arises.
It is protective.  Not the highest quality!
had the same case for my note 3 and still love it. as a now iphone user I was so worried about it breaking yet the day I put the case on I dropped it yet nothing happened. couldnt be happier with the purchase
Item has a weird black border and is not very appealing
"I bought this about a year ago. I was initially reluctant to keep it as it seemed Mickey Mouse and fragile. But, what the hell. This was not a cheap holder in terms of price. Well yesterday my initial impression was verified. While driving along the flimsy right phone holder arm broke. I did not even hit a bump. Just driving along and suddenly my phone is in the floor. Evidently the only way this will perform is as a subscription product where you buy a replacement on an annual basis. Don't buy."
"for the price, fantastic! only the car charger is a little slow charger not like the original wall charger."
Not working USB ports on my Mac at all times. Does work when plugged in with the wall adapter from Apple.
This item is a battery saver if I'm in the car. For my apartment I have a 12v DC power supply with a cigarette lighter plug so I can continue to use the radio without worrying about running low on battery power. I have purchased  3 UV-82 radios and so I'll be buying a few more of these Eliminators. I recommend this product to everyone with a car and a UV-82.
"I was looking for a duel charger and came across this item. Works great in the car, just as advertised. Would especially recommend for the price point."
For the price this is a great product. It's sturdy and easy to use. Nice silicone linig and can still put in headphones without any obstruction. Some are too bulky and u can stick the phone jack in completely. Great product!
I had read other reviews about this product.  Since I read the negative reviews as well as the positive I was concerned that the case would not fit well or protect the phone.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The case is extremely well engineered and fits perfectly and should provide excellent protection.
"Nice phone tattoo, but absolutely NO protection!  Of course, I dropped my phone and cracked the screen within a month.  Bleh.  Why can't we have beauty and functionality?"
Great quality.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you cannot use the case as a stand like many other similar wallet styles.
"Product fits the screen well and looks great. I had an issue with a crack in the screen, but they replaced it immediately for me, and were very nice."
"The product arrived on time and appears to be the item pictured. It claims to be oleophobic but after only 3 days I already have finger oil stains that will not rub out. That being said, the protector seems to be serving its purpose; I have already dropped the phone once face down from waist height and there was no visible damage. I think a little oil glare is worth the protection factor."
"I really like this charger set. It is so nice to be able to plug in my phone and have enough cable to allow the phone to be used in back seat. The charge seems to go quickly, it charges even with navigation on. I have not used it for data transfer but am impressed with all other aspects. I was offered a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Works well with iPhone.  Will not charge iPad Air 2 since it is not an Apple certified product.
when you use it the phone have different sound I had to replace my phone from att then I use the case again so the problem is from the case
"This is a great phone mount for road bike. I researched many options, and I really appreciate the flexibility of phone size. I have an iPhone 5s in an otter box case. It locks in with no problems."
"Just a great thing to have in the car.  Charges a tablet and phone simultaneously while you are driving, seems like decent quality."
So far I really like this case for the money.  I actually dropped my phone and the case did protect it.
"Exactly the product I wanted, very good price, received in no time. In fact, I ordered two more."
"I love my Aapporto Bag!  I use it for dog walking.  It holds everything I need.  ID, credit cards, Note 4 and a few other small items.  It even has room in the back compartment for a small note pad and pen. The quality and construction are good and best of all it fits a 4'10 shetland pony like me, cross body style!  Fortunately it's adjustable for taller folks.  The customer service is excellent too.  Robyn from Aapporto recently sent me an email detailing how to clean the bag of dog hair and lint both of which I have an abundance of.  I do agree with a previous customer who said he would like to see Aapporto make this in a brown waxed canvas style.  If they could do that and keep it in a reasonable price point, I'm sure they could give the Quill and Pad people a definite run for the money."
"This was a great solution to fixing a cracked screen.  Everything went smooth. I would recommend and buy this again, if need be."
Suction for window no longer sticks. Has fallen a couple of times while driving. No longer using this due to safety concerns.
This is a very functional phone cover. I love the flip cover function of it for protecting your screen. I live the simple white cover to it and that the back is clear showing through it the phone itself. The phone stays put in place nicely The port cutout in the bottom is almost the entire length of the phone so you don't have to worry about chargers not fitting into it while your phone cover is on. I will be using this case for going out to make sure my phone is protected while in my wristlets as it gets hit against things and I like the extra protecting for my screen. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. That in no way swayed my opinion of this product.
Fits like a glove. Spigen always a great product.  Enhances the beauty of the Samsung s6 edge plus.  Barely adds any addition weight to the phone.  I loved It!
"Have had this product for a few days now. It came on time and it plugs into my ihome perfectly. It charges my phone and let's me play music. Although my phone gave me a notification that the device was not recognized, it still works perfectly. I am satisfied with the item for the amount of money I paid (:"
The case fits perfect love the red to match all my other red stuff. It feels sturdy and does a good job of still letting you take advantage of the edge
Glass looks perfect but did not get the adhesive.  Contacted seller to try to get it.  Will update when i have resolution either way.
I love it I just wish there was a opening so I can charge my phone with it close
"Despite using soap water and window glass cleaner several times, it carries a hazy streaks, blotches . Never looks &#34;crystal clean&#34;; not even for a minute. Otherwise, it's a good  light thin flexible protective case."
I was unhappy with this product. The back is made from a very cheap plastic and started to loose color very quick. The phone just didn't feel protected with this case.
I will not fit if you have an Otter box case the plastic part is too wide and it will not insert.
"This works very well.  I installed it following the directions put the case back on, and I have had a clear screen ever since.  The screen protector is invisible and not discernible to the eye.  The only difference that I have detected is that my fingerprint substitute for the passcode to activate my phone now is much more consistent in its effectiveness since I installed the screen protector; but I can see no understandable reason why this should be a cause and effect relationship."
"I bought this case because of the awesome reviews and it did protect my iPhone 6 plus like it's supposed to but it was irritating that using the touchscreen was very difficult. It was annoying that I had to literally pound on my phone in order to end a phone call. I took the case off a few times and re-positioned it to see if I might have put it on wrong, even had my husband put the case on to make sure we had a good fit but it still didn't work. I'm not going to use it anymore and just find a different case. Disappointing too b/c the price was great."
"pure crap!  Always remember, you get what you pay for.  Item didn't work out of the package."
Probably the best kit for the money. I am 100% satisfied.  Even the place that installed the kit was impressed for what was paid. Always go with oxygen free.
"It's already cracked within the first few months. I've never had a screen crack with or without a protector, and my phone hasn't gone through any more damage than usual. I think this protector might be a little too rigid and that may be why, but I wouldn't order this again."
Ordered the wrong case and Gambolex sent me the right one for no extra charge. They were so good about it that I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again and again in the future. The new case fits my tablet perfectly and looks great. I highly recommend this product!
Great !! working without major problems !!
"So far so good, it seems to be working for my daughter and she has nothing negative to say, actually compaired to the unit she had before it charges her kindle much faster."
This case is good for what it is. It doesn't make the phone bulky like some other cases. Just a heads up that there isn't anything to cover the screen itself with this case.
"Excellent small unit that pretty much works as described.  I say &#34;pretty much&#34; only because I had read some reviews that indicated some issues with continuous charging.  I did experience this once, but am not sure that the unit was to blame.  I was charging a cell phone and a smart watch (with wireless charging) over night while on vacation and, one morning, woke up to find neither the watch or the phone charged, and the unit was not working.  I unplugged it and then plugged it right back in the same outlet, and it proceeded to charge fine that morning and then the remaining times I used it.  So, since house I was in was brand new, and since there were no clocks in the room that would be blinking in the event of an electrical outage, I really cannot be sure it was the iClever device.  As a result, I am giving iClever the benefit of the doubt, but giving it 4 stars and not 5.  If I determine that there are any issues, I will update my review."
"I am a pretty big power user of my cellphone and it barely lasts a full day even though it is pretty new (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge), I love my phones ability to charge wirelessly and thought it was about time I got a new battery pack to charge it when i travel without having to have cumbersome cables in my pockets etc.. so I bought one of these. First of all WOW makes life much simpler once i worked out that you have to switch the wireless charging on and off :) (light RED led on, wireless charging on )<br /><br />For a device with 10000mAh it is pretty compact in size and is constructed to a similar standard to most cellphones in that it may or may not survive being dropped on concrete but I am not going to test the theory.<br /><br />Also, using the accompanying cable allows me to quick charge (at 2.1Amps) 2 other devices that use either Apple port or USB. This worked great on a long flight when I had forgotten to charge my iPad.<br /><br />Basically this works great!"
Smudge proof. I haven't had a single problem. I can't see scratches either. I'm very pleased with this screen protector.
"Great screen protector. It comes with everything you need for installation, which is pretty simple. Though, there were a few air bubbles that were somewhat difficult to remove, but we got most of them. And there  was no debris stuck underneath.  The screen protector fits well and lines up well, but it doesn't quite reach the edges. That's really the only thing I didn't like about the protector. There is too much unprotected space on the edges. Though my case does cover a good amount of that space.The best thing is the anti-shatter film and the coating really does prevent finger prints. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
This is the best TPU case I have even seen.  Very good quality.  The fit is awesome.  Very tight and sturdy.  The bumps for power/volume has bit different texture which is super nice.  The color is vibrant and really nice.  Makes my whilte colored phone look super good.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case.  Just really nice.
"I started having issues with cheaper lightning cables not charging my iPhone 5S, or my wife's iPhone 6.  So I tried the Apple MFi Certified ones.  So far they are working great!"
Took it on a road trip in the middle of the summer and I guess the heat was too much for the plastic so it broke and fell right off my windshield while I was driving. Only used it 3 times before it broke.
"Solid construction. Had a problem sliding the case open to use the phone in hot weather - very difficult to slide.<br />As a result, I purchased another case of a different type."
So far it is looking great. Fits my tablet good and helps me hold on to it. Very thin so keeps tablet feeling thin and light. Would buy another cover in a different color if I ever want to have a change.
"I have really liked this case. I love not having to carry a wallet and my phone. I wish it could hold more cards. I tried to put a few more in and it pushed too hard on the screen. You definitely have to keep it to a minimum. I read a lot of reviews saying it seemed cheap, but I thought it was pretty nice. I am kind of hard on phones and my kids like to use them too and this has held up great for me. I have had it for a while and I have had nothing fall apart or break.  I can access all of the buttons easily. I have dropped my phone a few times and it seemed to have protected it pretty well....no cracked screens yet."
Honestly don't get why everyone is saying it does t work. I had someone who knows what they are doing repair mine and it was just fine
I've gotten lots of compliments on it and it fits nicely. I'm obsessed with Dalí and it makes a good ice breaker.
it has a hard time understanding voice commands so I always type in address I want. Other than that works good
Good price for a great product. On a partially sunny day this panel charged my Galaxy S5 from 25% to 60% in less than 2 hours. I will be getting another for my bug out bag.
"Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed with this case especially for the price I paid for it (around $20 including the shipping costs). It looked really nice to begin with and then started peeling and scratching within a few weeks and the thin plastic near the volume buttons cracked off. I've had cheaper cases that lasted far longer"
When I first received my GPS I was excited.  Now not so much.  It is just not working well.  Having a hard time.
"I bought this phone from &#34;232Tech&#34;, they get 4 stars because I order a &#34;Black&#34; model and instead, I got the &#34;White&#34; model.<br /><br />So far, the product meets the expectation... a simple Android-based to keep Grandma in touch via Skype and WhatsApp."
"The sleep recorder is a bit erratic<br />The emphasis is all on steps, at the expense of eg bicycle or kayak, without a proper conversion of effort, which should be the main feature, not just steps.<br />Worth persevering with though"
"The camera is not working.  After installation, you can only see lines as picture attached. No option to contact seller after purchase.  Edited: Camera worked after connecting the power to the head unit.  Tail lights don't provide the full 12 volts and the camera needs 12 volts to work properly."
"This is and will be the only case I put on my G6. I love this case its strong and sleek. I have dropped my phone 3 times since owning it and I have not noticed any cracks on my phone nor on the case! I got stickers and put one on each backing and switch them out each week. I love the gold, silver, and slate color. The phone fits perfect in all my pockets. Geez I can't say how awesome this case is!!!"
"Functional enough to see the phone for Google Maps, but not so great on hot days. Great for keeping the phone cool, however not so great for driver and passengers. Didn't cool off the car fast enough, because it blocked of one a the middle air vents."
"I am always getting bored with my phone cases, so I'm always trying new ones. This one caught my eye right away with it's bright green color (my favorite) and black trim. The black trim actually provides a nice gripping material to hold my phone. It was nicely packaged and very easy to put on my phone. It seems very sturdy as well, which is always a plus. It isn't very thick, so it does not add a lot of weight/thickness to my phone. Its bright color let's me easily find it in my huge purse, too! :) I would definitely buy again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review. All comments and opinions are my own."
"Very discreet--the most visibly subtle Bluetooth headset I have seen--James Bond will be buying one of these. I can hear well, and the person I speak to also said they can hear me clearly. I just received it, so I will continue to test on more phone calls. I will update my review if anything changes."
It charged my Note and iPhone with no problem.  Great when you need an extra charging port in your car.<br /><br />I received this sample in exchange for an unbiased review.
"The LEVIN Waterproof case is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is sturdy, made of ultralight hard PC plastic and Glass Screen Protector that works flawlessly with iPhone 6 Touch ID. The case weighs 1.64 oz/ 47.5 grams and is 0.4&#34;/12mm thick. The granular surface is slip-proof. All ports, buttons and controls align perfectly and are accessible. Package contains the case, an audio extension cable, a microfiber tissue and user manual. Setup is easy and intuitive.<br /><br />I tested the case by placing tissue paper inside it and fully immersed it overnight in a sink full of water. The results confirmed that the LEVIN case is indeed waterproof, there were no leaks, and all tissue contents were dry.<br />Charger port only fits the original Apple jack. The audio port requires an extension (provided).<br />With the phone inside the case, sound quality is excellent. No damping or muffling.<br /><br />I took my iPhone 6 (inside the case) with me on a boat ride this weekend and, for the first time, did not need to put it in a cumbersome plastic locking &#34;waterproof &#34; through which one cannot dial, answer a call or take a picture - all of which I was able to do easily with the LEVIN Waterproof case.<br />I really like it and shall keep my phone well protected inside this case.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees."
The Camera works great! The cameraI was shipped on time. I love this camera and I also love the price!
Received this as a gift.  Phone attaches quickly and easily and feels secure. Only complaint is the telescoping pole is pretty stiff and takes muscle to push in and pull out.
"Recieved in turn for an honest reveiw.<br />The case is very sturdy, and all the ports and buttons align and work very well.<br />I love the fact that the covers for the charger port, aux port and the silence button on the side fit very nicely and do not come loose.<br /><br />Only thing that I notice which is not to big of a deal for me is the screen protector that is attached to the case.<br />My screen protector shows like an oily pattern when the screen is off.<br />Slightly visible when screen is on low brightness."
Was looking for bluetooth sport headphones...considered beats but didn't want to pay the price. Saw these and the reviews and I was sold. These were a steal a $18!! Ended up ordering some for my wife and a co-worker
Fast delivery...just as described.
It takes you the long way around. Pretty much of the time....<br />I'd wouldn't sell it to my worst enemy!
"Very nice case, but clasp magnetic not strong enough to handle my cc additive and money.  Had to return, but sorry to have to do so."
"The sound is great, and I don't get any complaints from the person on the other end. The earpiece that came with it didn't fit my ear well and I couldn't hear with it, so I used a yurbud piece to put over it instead. Now it's perfect for me! I like how easy it is to use, and the battery life seems to last for a while. Great headset!"
In general it is a good case. However within the two days of use the red polka dot color began to come off from the strap. All other designs are still in prestine condition.
This is a great case.  I love that it is fully enclosed with a built-in screen protector.  No problems with tactile sensitivity or anything else on the screen after almost 2 months of using it.  Protects really well and is a very nice looking case.
"I had begun dropping my iPhone more regularly lately and was looking for a more sturdy case, but I didn't want something too overwhelming.<br /><br />The i-Blason case fits my needs perfectly. It is reasonably priced, goes on very snugly and doesn't interfere with my use of the phone.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend it."
They were able to synch with the car DVD but the volume was terrible!!
"The sound is good, a little muffled for my taste but good enough for training. However, for me personally I found them painful to put on more than an hour. Thus, I took one star out.<br /><br />Other than that the battery life is as described, switching between devices is a breeze, very light you can hardly feel them while training."
"Nice simple case, very protective back.  The rubber around the outside is a little tough making it a struggle to press the power button, but it's gotten more flexible over time."
Great case. Fits really well and comes with screen protector. I like the design and even though case is only a bumper all the buttons work perfectly. My phone color is Gold so it matches prefect. I am very happy to get this at discount price.
This 5.5 is kicking no problem family member no complain everybody is happy I am happy thank you keep up the good work Mr blu
"I've used Spigen Slim Armor cases on my last couple of devices, and recommend them to everyone that asks about my case.  Great fit and finish, adn the kickstand is a nice touch.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a better case, and with Amazon's pricing, you can't go wrong."
Battery life not as expected. everything else is great.
I used it until the new Grinch cover came in. Will start to use it after the first of the year. Well made and good protection for your phone
"Been a big fan of all Anker products and this one is great as well.  Just be careful if a blinding blue LED light bothers you. Customer service is top notch, will continue to buy anker."
"Fell apart the first time I used it. The white part just fell to the floor in pieces leaving the cord silver. Also the neck,  where the cord meets the head, is frail. As of someone started to cut it off! It works though."
I was very satisfied with this product and I was more than satisfied with its delivery because it came earlier than I expected it to.
"This case works well as a belt clip, but there are too many design flaws with the case. When the phone is in the case you can't push the down volume button. The sticker on the inside of the case started coming up within one month of use from getting the phone out of the case."
"Love this product!! Not only will it protect your whole screen from cracking, but it somehow keeps the screen less oily.  I love the feel of it when I'm typing and  makes it easier for me."
"Everything & more, better than otterbox which I had prior."
"Cannot find a cover for it anywhere, hard to text with long finger nails and it froze when speaking to rep at Tracfone and now lost all my contacts and pictures of my grandkids, lost everything on the phone! It is being replaced by Tracfone but information on the phone is gone,"
"The case itself cracked very quickly, and popped off my phone, and the rubber part around the camera lens hole popped off too. It's okay, but wouldn't get it again. I switched it out maybe 6 months after buying this."
"The case is wonderful, I get compliments on it all the time . I tell them I got it on Amazon. It's working out excellent for meI would suggest anyone buy this type of case if you carry your phone in your pocket"
"Setup is easy and comfort is pretty good, but the sounds is pretty bad. Super heavy on the bass to the point that any music or voice (i.e., podcasts) are very muffled sounding. The in-line mic/control piece is pretty awkward/bulky as well, but I guess they need somewhere to put the battery :)<br /><br />The price probably reflects what you should expect out of these, but if you're looking for more long-term headphones, I'd either wait for better technology or spend some more on a name brand."
"Use this in my kayak for fishing/paddling trips all the time.  works great!  no issue with occasional water splashing or the like.  Charges the iPhone pretty well but will use a lot of the speakers battery for that, just FYI.<br />Just spent 3 full 10-16 hour days tearing off and re-roofing my house and this speaker was playing the entire day (on about 1/2 volume) non-stop each day. I did recharge each night but the fact that it can go 12+ hours on one charge at a decent volume is very impressive.  Sound is great too if its not at 100% volume (no speaker I've used sounds good at that level)."
"Broke within one week, was replaced by Amazon and has been working since (about 3 weeks). Does not seem to be the same quality as Apple, though."
"The edges don't lie flat on the phone. The screen immediately got dust under all the edges. Didn't last more than maybe a few months. They should just make it smaller, so it lies flat. I bought a new one by a different company, and it lies flat."
"Simple to use, accurate.  Has courses pre-loaded.  Uses buttons instead of touch screen."
"Functions perfectly, although sometimes hearing it becomes difficult becuase the sound is not clear enough it should have more volume"
"Very cheap copy of the apple adapter.  Lasted less than a month.  When I got around to trying to return it, it was too late."
This product will absolutely keep water out.  Sometimes when opening water droplets do get dropped inside and remain inside however it never damaged my phone.  I kept a paper towel inside to absorb all the droplets which worked.  I was not however able to use this product underwater as the touch screen does not respond when the phone is underwater so no underwater images unfortunately.  Adapts to almost any phone and very easy to use.  I also love the strap which allowed me to wear the phone around my neck.
No protection. Only good when your trying to watch movies at work.
I now have two of these switches. Easy to install and the app is great.  I love the integration with ifttt.  I schedule the front porch light to automatically turn on at sundown and turn off two hours later.  Great smart switch!
"It may take you a few minutes, but do yourself a favor and read all the reviews for this product. I assure you it will be entertaining, but more importantly I'm sure you'll agree that at least half of them are fake! I had a good laugh, but I won't be purchasing this product."
I've bought other &#34;lightning&#34; cables in the past...but these are the real deal!  Can't get over how fast it charges my phone!  Cable quality and the 10' length are fantastic.
Item arrived after expected date. The item is cheaply made not worth the long wait that it takes to get to you. I have no idea if it is actually water proof because I'm not willing to take the chance and test it. Buy at your own risk.
Unfortunately it didn't work with my Galaxy S4 phone; so I had to return it. Instead I purchased the Samsung S4 battery case with the wireless receiver already attached and it works like a charm!
Using with Ram Tough Claw to mount GPS in RZR side x Side - working great and holds Nuvi very snuggly while riding rough trails and roads. This unit will definitely not come loose.
"The product is OK, but it squeezes against my ears so tight that I cannot wear it for more than 10 minutes.  Not a good design.  Don't buy this headset unless you have a tiny head."
"Best charging cord ever!!!!!! Not only do I thoroughly enjoy the length of this cord, it does charge my phone a lot faster than the factory cable that comes with the phone."
"This is the charger to have in your glove box of your car or boat. All you need to charge this charger is the sun, no matter where you are you can usually see the sun. "
I have always used Otter boxes.  I took a chance on this and I really like it.  It is durable and more streamlined than my other cases.
"Fits great and does its job so far. I wish this had a screen protector, but its exactly what we needed."
Purchased this for my dad after he took his phone for a swim without a waterproof case. He says he loves it!
"Defintely test it out first before you put your iPhone in it.  It leaked the first time, but after I got the air out of it first, then it was fine.  It's a little cheaply made, so this is really only good for a 2-3 times use.  Overall, good for the price and for a one time use.  I threw mine away after our trip to Hawaii."
"It takes the cover off of your phone when you take it off, pretty annoying actually.  I wonder if I'm going to damage my phone when i put it on or off.  Other than that it's fine."
Fits my S5 perfectly. Only problem is the thing is HUGE and is award to wear at the gym.
This is the second time I order this screen protector. I constantly drop my phone in its face and this protector probably started to get a little damaged around the 20th time I dropped it. But it did its job and protected my actual screen! There wasn't one scratch on it
"Great phone, however it does NOT have a place for a sim card. Not happy with the false advertisement."
Would not recommend plastic edges where the phone sits chipped off and I've only had it for a month.
No problems. Works well and the blue light is cool. Packaging was great.
Got this for a replacement for my sons phone. His wouldn't hold a charge anymore. When this one came in he put it in his phone right away and it has worked great and will hold a charge.It had a 75% charge on it when we got it in the mail. It fit his phone just like it came with his phone.
"Junk, lasted about four hours. Won't turn back on, hopefully they'll send me a new one, or money back"
"Exactly what it says, I've bought 5 cars and this one is by far my favorite. I have two!"
It works only a little better than the original battery which barley lasts the day without even regular use once it has been charged..no problems with on time delivery
My phone fits fine and it has been durable and the key pocket has worked great for me. The only Cons I can find is that the ring used to connect the extension strap pinched my arm and after a while of running I had to stop to align it and then keep running. I drilled two small holes on the plastic ring and then sewed the ring to the original strap to prevent it from rotating and no more arms pinch.
"I loved these headphones great sound ni cracks with volume up all the way, but they just stopped working today no more than 10 min ago. Nothing happened I unplugged them then when I plugged them back in 10-15 min later nothing. So so so so very disappointed."
"This is a truly great GREEN product!  Unlike plastic phone covers, the eCo-cover doesn't slip out of hands or pockets per its &#34;rubbery&#34; feel, but made from CORN!  Baby safe BPA free makes it ok for our grand-babies to chew on and handle.  So we protect our phones, grandkids, and the environment all at once.  So cool."
"Put my iPhone in this and took it out on the water in a Kayak. The pictures were perfect, and I could easily make phone calls and receive text messages."
"This review is for: Car Charger, Benks 3 Ports USB 5.5 Amp (2.4a 2.1a 1a) Smart Universal High Capacity in black<br /><br />I received a sample for my honest review.<br /><br />This charger is very compact so it does not protrude too much from the port. With three ports, we can keep all our electronics charged up on the go without fights in our van. This charges our iphones and ipods quickly without any connection problems. It feels well made and sturdy.<br /><br />No problems so far."
I ordered these batteries as replacements for my wife's phone. A month outside of the eligible return window one of the batteries swelled and stopped functioning. Hopefully I can find a more reliable vendor to order a replacement for the defective battery they sent me that won't nearly pop inside her phone.
This things is AWESOME. Fits great and it appears to be able to protect it no problem. I can even use my Samsung Wireless charger through it which I could not do with another style. Not having to take the case off every night to charge is a bg bonus. The kickstand appears to be metal in the photo. It is plastic. Still works but I fear the mechanism that holds (Plastic Bump) it into the case will wear out and the kickstand will become useless and have to be ripped off. We will see though.
"Didn't fit phone at all, very cheap and poorly constructed. Don't waste your time or money."
Purchased this for my daughter.  She is very happy with product
"Well made, durable, excellent buy, and excellent seller to do business with."
"Incredibly cute Totoro case, his face here cracks me up! This held together fairly well in the 6 month time-frame I used it for, the picture didn't get scratched off or anything. Decent price as well."
"Audio clarity is excellent.  I haven't had a dropped call since I started using this headset.  I'm am told by people on the other end the call has excellent audio as well.  The headset is a little large and takes a little time to get used to or it did for me.  I wear glasses and that may be why it took some time but I am very happy with the features that my old bluetooth headsets didn't have and the call clarity and reliability they did not have either.  I really like the single use buttons as the mute was frequently unusable on my other headsets but a piece of cake with this one.  As to talk time it seems to be very close to what they claim, I seem to be getting somewhere between 6 to 7 hours between charges.  For someone who uses a headset professionally this headset is well worth the extra coin."
Haven't had a chance to use it yet. But it arrived ok and is fully charged and ready to go.
Battery life was okay ... but the build quality was horrendous!... on both batteries the flat cover for the bottom of the batteries came off the first time I put them on the included battery charger!. Needless to say I sent them back and got me a refund.
"Fits perfectly, lots of extra room for my other cables and earbuds. Great quality and very sturdy material. Protects the headphones wonderfully!"
"I dropped my iPhone in a river this weekend, after searching for about 5-10 minutes for it I found it buried in the mud about 3ft below water. I was still panicking until I hit the home key and it turned on like nothing had happened. I've dropped this thing a couple times too without any damage to the phone. There are hairline fractures in the plastic but apparently they haven't compromised the watertightness of the case. Sooooo happy I put this case on my phone!"
Piece of crap. So tight. Doesn't even Barely fit.
I received a bad part after putting on it starting separating from the base and had to pay to get a brand new screen after already buying this one
I love this screen cover. It  installs easy an protects my screen as advertised. I would recommend it  as one of the best.
Headphones work well. I use them for three hours every other day and the battery has lasted well.  They charge quickly.  Its been much easier to turn them on and off once I got the hang of turning them on and off with the left earphone in my ear so I could hear the alerts.
Very bad quality. It broke very easily because the extension was glued on. I would not recommend this product.
"Biggest POS I have ever bought in my life!  Waited too long to install so couldn't return it.  Remote doesn't work, eject button broke on first day and DVD player skips on every bump.  Sent it back to Pyle (AKA pile!) After paying 50 dollars in shipping got in back and had all the same issues within a week.  Time for a sledge hammer and a $250 loss!"
Great protection! Make sure you get a case that protects the screen edges. I wish I knew that prior to purchase.
Good phone case but I cannot turn the button on the side from silence to ring with the case on. I have to remove the case to do so.
"Received this phone the other day and it's exactly what I needed.  It is a refurbished phone but it's in excellent condition.  No scratches or visible sign of use.  Came in original box with all necessary accessories.  All I had to do was slip my already owned and active AT&T sim card (from a broken phone I was replacing with this one) into the slot and voila!  Back to business as usual.  Didn't need to contact AT&T, unlock or register anything online, etc.  It just works period.  And is set for service in the United States,  east coast to be specific.  Thanks for excellent service and a perfect product. Please be advised that you may want to double check but I'm almost positive that this phone will only work with an AT&T plan and not T-MOBILE.   I was told that the Skyrocket version of the Galaxy S2 was exclusive to AT&T.  I am confident that it will 100% work great on AT&T networks but if you have any other cell carriers call them first and ask if the Skyrocket can be activated on their network.   I'm pretty sure the answer is no. Hope this helps anyone interested. =)"
It looks pretty cheap in person. Doesn't look like it would protect my phone either. You get what you pay for.
It's great if you tend to drop your phone alot like me. It's very durable and it does glow in the dark somewhat.
Total piece of crap- use your iPhone. I got lost out of Boston Logan. This thing can't be trusted. My trusty iPhone worked. What the hell was I thinking?
"I have never had a non glare screen protector and while it does add better viewing in highly lighted areas and in the sun it does not have the Anti-Fingerprint and bubble free application.  FROM THE DESCRIPTION......Features: Matte, Anti-glare, Anti-fingerprint, anti-scratch, anti-ultraviolet, bubble-free application, ultra-clear transparency, ultra-strength, and improves handwriting recognition.<br />I still have to clean it as much as the ones that are not non glare and myself and someone else tried to put it on several times and althought we got bubble retuction down each time we applied there are still about 4 little and one a little larger bubble.<br />All and all still happy with the product though, better than the last screen protector I had and a great value for the price."
"There is a ridge on the bottom that partly blocks the rear charger port on my Garmin GPS.  However, I just managed to shove the Garmin into position with the cord attached.  The holder grips it firmly and doesn't slide around on the dashboard.  The last universal holder I bought had little plastic gripper fingers that broke.  So far, this holder seems to be a more reliable performer."
"Slightly heavier than i thought it would be but that's ok. Haven't really used it much yet but i'll be taking it to work with me this week to try it out. Takes a while to fill to 100% which is understandable.<br /><br />I've finally used it and i've found that it loses power just as fast as the item charging!  My Note 4 has a 3220mAh battery and it seems that for every percent i gain on my phone, I lose it on the charger! Let's hope this is just a fluke."
"Great phone ,cheap and better<br /> than Nokia Lumia 822.That one crushes sometimes for no reason.!"
"Great protective case, cheaper than life proof, have used case for under water photos and just in the shower.  Slight loss of touch screen sensitivity but not enough to complain about"
The case didn't fit the phone properly and the buttons didn't line up. Waste of money.
"Case fit perfectly, the design does not wear off like many other cases I have bought in the past. My favorite case by far and would recommend to anyone who likes Fairy Tail."
This cord seems to work okay for me the only problem I had was that I believed to order the 5 foot cord and I got the 3 foot cord instead I had I had the 5 but could check off on the order but somehow that wasn't what I got however it is a good card but just make sure if you are ordering the 5 foot cord that's what you get
Works great and the price was right. The 2 different charge rates (one 1amp one 2.1amp) are a nice feature.
"I wouldn't recommend dropping your phone in a public toilet, but I did.  I grabbed it quickly, after it totally submerged, and it actually kept working."
"Best made and my second purchase for my Daughter.Excellent reception, noise reduction and fit. You can't go wrong with this one."
Does what is expected
Exactly what I needed. Fit perfect and the install was a breeze.
"loving them , I got the black one also ."
Great product. I wish I had ordered one years ago. Works on my old Droid Bionic. Gives me all day use. Bought 2 so my wife would not have to charge her battery except at night. Extended back covers fits perfectly and the screen protectors and wipes were a bonus. Actually my phone is easier to hold now that it is thicker. Buy one. You will like it.
"I now have an iPhone 5 with a new lease of life with a good battery.  As well as carefully reviewing the good instructions and video, I would recommend that you search youtube.com for &#34;iphone pry damage&#34;.  The riskiest part of replacing an iPhone battery is damaging the circuit board around the battery when prying off the battery.  While the instructions provided here show the &#34;safe&#34; places to pry, other sources suggest only the case edge should be used.  I also recommend doing this in a warm environment, we did this in a hot room on a very hot day and the higher temperature very likely softened the adhesive and made the prying relatively easy.  It takes a while from the case side and there are some rather unnerving ripping like sounds as the adhesive gives way but it all worked in the end.<br /><br />A good product at a great price.  I take off one start because the pentalobe tool was too big for the screws on my iPhone 5 - a Nov 2012 Verizon edition.  I don't know if the pentastar screws got bigger in later editions but coaxing these screws out at the start of the procedure was the most difficult part of the whole exercise.  The screen removal and even the battery prying were quicker in comparison!"
"Hated the way it fit my Samsung Galaxy S3. It seemed to have a lot of wiggle room still.  My main complaint is that the case I received covered the flashlight and it was very hard to use the side buttons.  Plus the stand seemed very cheap,  broke within days so the stand kept popping out. I felt like my phone wasn't very safe in this as well. Wasn't good for my phone at all."
I'm wasn't such a fan of the texture of the case. It's really rough. I ended up covering the case in epoxy to make a smooth finish. Now I love the case! Super sparkly and cute!
"My button is hard to press. Can't get the led to turn on.<br />Sent an email, hopefully they'll respond.<br />I may have received a defective product."
"It's a good case, but it's not made for Xperia Z1 because the ports are not accessible, so you can't charge or use headset with the case on.  I give it 3 stars beause it protects the phone well.  Perhaps it fits other models better?"
"Magpul cases are always great value for the money, this was no exception. The one thing I take away a star for is the slight slipperiness of this material, though I'm comparing it to that of Speck's Candyshell Grip cases which are my overwhelming favorite. Wish Magpul would design in some extra grip (stylish as a gun case, of course) so that I'd be more confident my $1,000 phone will have a fighting chance of staying in my hand or where I place it."
"This item is fine, but why, OH WHY does it have an LED on it?<br /><br />Let me explain...<br /><br />I'm guessing most people charge their phones, etc., at night. I'm guessing a lot of them, like me, have their charger by their bed.<br /><br />And I'm also guessing most people want to sleep in a more-or-less dark room.<br /><br />Well, TOO BAD, because rather than looking at your device to see if the charger is working (which you will do anyway, to make sure the cord works and is plugged in all the way), this charger, by your bed, has a nice, bright LED on it to tell you it is working.<br /><br />Even sticking it in a nightstand drawer gave the outline of the drawer a real special-effect, &#34;E.T.&#34; sort of glow.<br /><br />Okay, fine, it's a small problem—a piece of electrical tape over the light solved it—but I'm continuously baffled by things like this. I have hearing loss, and the electric hearing drier I put my hearing aids in at night has FOUR LEDs on it. Can't even keep it in the same room with me if I want to sleep. I could read by it.<br /><br />I'm sure Anker put a light on this to try to be helpful, but honestly it seems like it's not really paying attention to the most common use case? Or perhaps &#34;charging at night on your bedside table&#34; is an edge case?<br /><br />Otherwise, it absolutely works. Rant aside, I'd buy it again."
Nice durable  case.  The volume and power on/off button very hard to use.
"I bought this case trying to enhace the cosmetic aspect of my Iphone 6 Plus, i was using a magpul case before this one and let me tell you it looks gorgeous.<br /><br />Top notch quality but be careful when taking off since it looks fragile too.<br /><br />Very good buy IMO."
Worked great for charging but did not work for the data in my car radio
"The case is really cute but once you put two cards and your phone in, it is difficult to close. Also the phone isn't tight inside the case."
Took about an hour to get the plastic part on after waiting almost a week and a half for it to come. Its a pretty color but I doubt its ever coming off.
"This is just what I was looking for - a durable, inexpensive, made-to-fit screen shield. Installation was straightforward thanks to the clear directions. The shield has been on my phone for 7 months now and still looks new. Fingerprints clean off easily and completely. Still no scratches. Does not dim or distort the display. I'm completely satisfied with this product."
You will need to purchase double sided tape in order for this product to work. Adhesive page is worthless. Directions are also not clear as to where to separate the broken glass. Do not assume that it's the seam in the phone's edge. You pry the glass off from the very top edge of phone.
"I replaced a failing Apple lightning cabe with this one and it works great.  The connector is the same size as the Apple connector, so it can be plugged in without having to remove the case I use."
Able to use the same number right away when switching from an old cell to an iPhone by modifying the existing SIM. Skipped the whole porting hassle.
Love this product! Came right away...and was easy to put on...Perfect fit for my phone!
"Is a very nice item, is practice, save the phone any time. The price is normal for it. I like so much. Thank you amazon for delivery faster in my address."
"I ordered it for use with my S6 but it won't work with my Otterbox installed, so no my wife has one in two different locations."
Works as advertised.  No issues on my 10.5 S.
"Nice and slim, haven't dropped it yet but the inside liner seems like it should protect it from 2-3' drops just fine.<br />I like the design and would recommend this case to anyone except and Eagles or Seahawks fan."
"After 2 years, my Fre model case was falling apart.  The rubber was tearing around the sides, the switch tab for the mute switch broke, and the plastic on both the front and back was warping from the heat of the phone.  I wanted a waterproof case, so I figured I would try the Nuud model.  The case seems much better than the Fre case with a more rigid back.  The use of a stick-on screen protector instead of the Fre cover is a world of improvement over screen viewing ability as well as touch control.  The raised edge around the screen takes just a bit to get used to, but it it certainly beefy enough to maintain a good seal against the surface of the phone.  I have no intention of getting the phone wet, so this case is just-in-case protection and appears that it will handle the task well."
Connected my entire downstairs to this which in turn is connected to a Sonos Connect.Amp.  Perfect sound through out the entire house.  Enabled me to hook everything up for a moderate cost.  I also love the ability to deselect speakers from the front.  I also didn't notice a difference in sound.  Great product.<br /><br />Super easy to setup.
"I bought this about two years ago. Today (August 29th 2015), this screen protector is still on my iPad and works just fine and lasts on the screen pretty much forever. Easy installation with no bubbles (just simply follow the rules). The sides have lifted up, but it still protects my iPad screen and definitely reduces the glares from excess sunlight."
Perfect.  Just what I expected.
"Unfortunately these are not working for me. They did charge just fine but will not connect to the bluetooth on my iPhone 6. Granted I did purchase them on sale but I did so because I do not need anything fancy, just something to allow me to listen to music etc while I am out for my morning walk. These are going back."
"This product is a must, it definitely protects your phone and great customer service!"
"I've been a big fan of a competing case brand for several years and had not heard of Verus until recently.  I'm glad I discovered them, though.  This case is superb!  I really dig the hairline texture on the back; it adds style to the case and gives me a good grip on the phone.  The only complaint I have is that the corners are the hard plastic and not the TPU rubber.  I'm just afraid that the plastic will crack if I drop my device and it lands on a corner.  It may hold up just fine, though.  Hopefully I never have to find out."
Great case i got this as a gift for a friend it perfect for credit card also if you want extra 20.00 for free check out the link http://www.mynetspendcard.com/?uref=8005772755
"GXT1000 are way better for about 1/3 the price!!  These claim to be &#34;Military Spec&#34;.  But out of the 15 my company bought about 6 of them have broken on their first drop. ( I have had the GXT1000 for a few months now and apart from a few scuffs they are still holding up way better than the 5000s)<br /><br />Pros:  The sound is very crisp!<br />The lithium battery is awesome!<br />Water resistant.<br />Midland is a wonder company to deal with! They really back their products.<br /><br />Cons:  the antenna is not attached very well.  Those 6 that broke on the first drop have broken either the antenna and or the power/volume nob.  The mic must also not be that great because when someone is speaking using one of these it sounds very low on all radios (both GXT1000s and GXT5000s and other midland models that others have on our crew).<br /><br />In conclusion; if you are not going to be working in the rain or near water, or if you don't mind charging your walkie every 12 hours (of heavy use).  DO NOT GET THIS MODEL.  You'll get a way better bang for your buck with the GXT1000 model (don't even think about the 2000s either! Midland doesn't even sell those themselves anymore..)"
I installed this into my Jeep Grande Cherokee and it works perfectly. 99% of the engine noise was eliminated from my speakers. Very simple to install.
"Sounds great, easy to use but the remote hardly works! I also have the MW1 and it only work about 40% of the time. Extremely frustrating!!!"
"Do not buy this product if you are looking for an actual otterbox.  Although this product says  &#34;Otterbox&#34; it is a knock off and I could tell from the moment I opened it.  The plastic is thin and feels like it would easily be broken, the rubber is too hard and not stretchy at all.  The back even says made in china.  Real Otterboxes are made in the USA.  I will not buy any product sold by this seller.  To add flame to the fire it took over 3 weeks to arrive, and it was complete junk, I hope this seller is shut down for fraud, and faces charges for ripping off the Otterbox design and name.  Shame shame."
A great deal.  Some people tell me they hear a slight echo.
This works well but it's a bit shaky. It may be more stable with a smaller phone but my IPhone 6 Plus just wobbles a little too much. I like it because it's extends longer than most other window mounted devices making it easier to reach in my Hummer.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking for a phone mount that extends longer that your typical mount.
"Works as advertised, both horizontally and vertically, and a good value.  Crafted to clear all S5 openings well.  I am satisfied."
Love this case. It fits and is of good quality.
"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review,the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn't interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. I have dropped my phone several times since and I also keep it in a large purse nice price for the durability and quantity"
"[[VIDEOID:56cad5d204e99f886c1ff956caa5204a]]HiFi for just a small size, when i received this Bluetooth speaker. i am already expecting that ill will just be like a phone when i play music because its too small fits my palm honestly although i am much impressed on packaging seller definitely got style. as soon i connected Bluetooth on my LG phone and start playing music darn what a HiFi, the bass and treble of music is great, I am surprised.I tried it on Micro SD card and it works too. with the small size i can bring this on parks to play music, pocket size so i can keep it on my pocket too. battery life is around 8 hrs of continuous playing, i did test that because i hook it up on my phone playing lullaby music for my toddler next room. good Bluetooth range, i don't need to get up to bed and change the lullabies song.<br />Easy to connect on Bluetooth, once your phone Bluetooth is ON just turn on the Bluetooth speaker, i am sure you will hear a Bluetooth ON\\"" then pair your device. Once paired you can start playing music.  Highly Recommended<br /><br />I received Bluetooth Wireless Portable Speaker by Argon technologies for FREE in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review."
"Perfect for running, does not fall off your arm and both my iPhone 6 plus and Note 3 will fit in it."
About the nicest charging cable I have bought in my many years of android usage. Connectors feel solid and the cable is nice and flexible.
"I wanted to love this cable, but it stopped working within a month. The cable it replaced (different brand) is frayed but still works. This K-ble charger is completely in tact but won't charge my phone anymore. Disappointing and a waste of money. Maybe I just got a bad one. Hopefully others will have better luck."
Love it!  Looks awesome in person!  The extra bulky/size that's added to the phone is itself is justifiable for the added protection.
I love the case it feels good in your hand it don't slip out and it  protects the phone nicely I have dropped my phone twice and it seems to hold up to no dings
This case has proven itself to be completely waterproof. We went kayaking down river and my husband was using this case with his iPhone 5s when he got flipped out of kayak. He lost his phone in the case because it did not float. In a little less than 24 hours we received a phone call stating the phone was found and it was working because find my iPhone gave them my number to call. The phone sat in case under water for almost 24 hours before it was found and still worked perfectly when we got it back. The only con is that we should have bought a floating wrist band to attach to it so it would not have sunk. Very thankful for this case for keeping our phone dry.
It is charging my Samsung NOTE 2 and S4 without a problem... works just fine. From 20% to 100% in about 2hrs.<br />I am happy.
Works as intended.  The slot through the middle is a nice touch for keeping a power cord attached.  We use it for a 10&#34; tablet in the family room.
This is a VERY nice product that came in useful as soon as it  was charged. PERFECT for my needs at work and on the road. Beautiful design and feels &#34;good&#34; to hold as well. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a power boost for their devices that allows the device to charge and be used at the same time (at least with a phone anyway!).
"This is my new favorite car charger. I love that it has a retractable cord. It also has a second usb slot so that you can charge a second item. I plugged my phone in to the retractable cable on my short trip home from work (about 15 minutes) and it charged my phone 5% in that short period of time. My previous charger would only maintain my phones charge on the same trip. The retractable cord is the perfect length for the card and it retracts smoothly, so it seems like it will last for a long time. This is a great charger for the price. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
Works OK but bad closing flap. Doesn't close all the way
"The charger cable lasted for only 2 months(it stopped to work suddenly, in perfect conditions), terrible quality, and after that, I have to use a Chromecast cable, which is not the same, it is terribly slow to charge it.<br /><br />Some applications will crush or not work as the iOS version, for example Audible not only crush but it makes the operating system as well. Waze looks and works terrible at Android(not sure if this only happens in this phone of every single Android)<br /><br />It has plenty of ASUS useless applications.<br />It is ok for its low price, but you will not get the quality of an iPhone on a ASUS Zenfone(just in case if you are a iOS user, do not switch to Android)<br /><br />The screen material is also very low profile, my Zenfone 2 got a scratch from... basically nothing, bad quality, I got to buy a temperate glass for it.<br />Any way, consider invest $200 in another smartphone"
Poor quality and not worth the money.  I feels like cardboard.  The only reason I am not returning it is that it will cost me $6 for shipping so I am only getting $3 refund.  I do not know how this product got so many 5-stars.
"So happy with the glass cover. I had a lifeproof case on my iPhone for two years while I was under contract but it was pretty beat. I wanted to keep my phone and get a new case and screen protector. I love it it's so clear not big and test I have dropped my phone and the glass isn't cracked. The phone is good and the screen protector is still perfect. This is my new go to product when I do decide to upgrade. The only downside, is on the iPhone 6 there is a space between the screen protector and the edge of the case. I'm hoping they will update and fix that"
Very Good case
Great case! Just wish it had it's own magnet to automatically turn phone on/off upon opening/closing. Otherwise it works perfectly for what I need it for.
"I bought it for my wife, she love this case."
"Like many other reviews, my set will not hold a charge after about a month of use. When they worked they sounded great &#60;assuming my phone was close enough to send\receive signal&#62; for music. I did get the audio drop out here and there when I was biking but it was never anything too bad or that would require a reparing. Forget about using these for a phone call since no one could ever hear me clearly when trying to use the built in microphone. Unfortunately now I get to throw these away because I am not able to charge the battery. Save your money and buy something that is better quality."
"I've been wanting to buy a selfie stick ever since it became popular and now I am happy to buy and use this particular selfie stick. Since I got it I was very impressed and I feel like it is a very high quality and nicely stylish product. It is also very simple to use even for me (I am not technical type) and work with my iPhone with no issue. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and honestly I couldn't find anything to complain about at all. Thank you for this great product!"
"The phone case was beautiful but I did not get a strap for the phone as pictured on the screen if you can,can you plz send me a strap for the phone case,  Thank you !"
Doesnt work well at all thru via cell its real hazy watchingh anything off of phone ... dont buy it
"Pretty disappointed. I installed on my 33' motorhome. It seems like any little thing causes it to fuzz up the image (static from the wireless reception.) It's cheap and hopefully as we've all learned, you get what you pay for. I just didn't feel like spending several hundred dollars on a system. It'll do but if you want a reliable rear camera wireless system, this isn't the one for you."
It works as advertising.
I think this would work great if I did not have a case on my phone.  I have an Otter Box case which I think is too heavy causing the vents in my car to sag and the phone/holder to slip off over bumps.  I ended up going with a dash-mounted holder because of this.
"fast delivery, Looks beautiful! Very happy with it!"
"Great product, and shipping by Amazon.  Currently charging the following with no issues:  Android phone, Android Tablet, Iphone 5, Ipad Air, Ipad Air2.  Works great, and the blue backlight are a plus at night, but mostly covered once you plug your cable into the usb jack."
A lot more durable than the original apple lightning cable. Amazon's warranty is also great. My cable messed up within a year and they sent me a full refund to purchase another one.
"The cover is great. The belt clip isn't the greatest for me, it always pops off of my belt while I'm working. I do construction so I could be up higher than a phone could handle the drop so I don't use it any more. Just put phone in pocket.like I said cover seems very durable"
"This came with a lifetime warranty and broke one day after the 30 day return time. I cannot find a way to return it either through Amazon or through Wildtek. I am highly disappointed in both companies.  After posting this review, Wildtek contacted me and honored the warranty. I appreciate the effort made by Wildtek and will recommend the company to other users. I"
"Great case.  Not so great screen protector.  I don't like the included protector because it doesn't stay stuck to the screen, so air pockets form and it has a &#34;bubbly&#34; feel when you're pressing on it.  Also, it doesn't have a slot for the microSD slot.  So if you want to add or remove the SD card, you have to take apart the case.  I'm going to use a razor blade and cut out an opening in the plastic for the SD slot.  I find the case difficult to separate/install/uninstall.  I broke my the outside half of my first case from removing it and reinstalling it several times, but I was probably pretty rough with it.<br /><br />I think its a great case, super durable when installed and looks nice.  I've dropped my phone several times on hard surfaces and its still good as new.  Good edges for phone calls and holding while typing.  My wife has same phone and she has another popular case and its ok but this one is better.<br /><br />IMO, best idea is to cut out the original protector and buy an aftermarket one, the kind that 'sticks' to the phone's screen.  Then re-assembled the case and it's perfect.  To remove the included screen, I used a razor blade and an old rag with some paint thinner.  Used the razor blade to cut off the screen and scrape off the glue from the backside of the case's edges.  Then removed any residual glue with the rag and a little bit of paint thinner.  Took about 10 minutes.  IMO was totally worth it.  No more bubbles and can use any screen protector you like.<br /><br />Case gets five stars, but overall four because of no sd card slot and included screen protector.  Still best case out there IMO even with the extra work.  I've bought two of them now and have tried three different cases and still think this ones the best."
"I would like to see some sort of secure closure piece on future versions. The flap doesn't always close flat on my phone automatically, so I have to set my phone down upside down, which defeats the purpose of the window.<br /><br />I do love the color though (although my fiance says it's old grandma color. Hah). And I like that it's thin. Time will tell on how durable it is, as I've only had it a couple days at home. As I go out and about or to work, hopefully it will hold up. :)"
Works great the cutouts are a little off but nothing moving it a little further to one side won't fix.
"had my plastic screen protector for a while and decided to replace with this, as long as your screen is free of any lint or dust this protector should stick to your phone perfectly! i didn't had to squeeze any bubbles out . also the products that comes in the package really helps with the cleaning."
"It's lightweight, very comfortable, and can even fit my phone with a thin case on it."
"This bluetooth performs exceptionally well in all respects.<br />1.  Fit and comfort. Exceeds my expectations in both categories.  Bluetooth comes with three ear buds (small, medium & large).  It takes a few minutes to get the hang of putting the buds on and taking them off the bluetooth but you can then experiment with all three to find the right fit.  At first I tried to wedge it in because it did not seem reasonable to expect it to stay in unless it was wedged in.  This product is designed to sit in your ear.  You do not need to put it in like a cork.  For me it fits perfectly with the bud facing back and slightly down.  Very comfortable, I can literally leave it in all day with no discomfort.  Buds are very soft and pliable<br />2.  Range-excellent.  I can leave my phone plugged in and walk outdoors<br />3.  Sound quality. Very good. Can be used to listen to books or music but good buds or headset would be preferable for music.<br />4.  Battery and recharge.  Very easy to recharge with the charging station.  Recharge lasts the full 6 hours and only takes 90 minutes.<br />5.  Bells & Whistles.  As with other plantronics this one works with voice commands and announces callers by name from contacts<br />Highly recommended, does not fall out of your ear and does not need to sit outside of your ear."
I ordered these to install in the front fairing of my Kawasaki Nomad. I wanted to see if I would get a bit more base and directed music flow as indicated in some forum posts out there. I had to trim a bit to have them fit which was OK but otherwise they did nothing to the level or change of the music. Nothing more than molded foam.
"Great case, easy to put on and take off. Nice that is flat so level app is quite accurate. It is nice having the clear back so you can see the phone itself"
"Bought it as a gift to my wife for her new phone.. She loved it.. And I often see her using the pockets for cards, when she doesn't want to bring her purse"
"Easy Installation and Love it!  Sound quality is perfect.  HOWEVER, I have experienced the unit locking up on numerous occasion since installed less than a week ago.  It will randomly stop responding to controls.  The music continues to play and change tracks, however, I'm unable to change tracks from the handlebar controls and if it switch to another source [i.e. FM, AM] and try to switch back to CD - it won't.  Its like my radio doesn't see the unit plugged into it anymore.  If i turn the key switch to Off and then back on, I am then able to switch to CD and control the unit again.  Anyone else experience this?"
"Not wild about this product.  After being in the sun for a few hours, it appeared the panels began to delaminate."
"I would have given 5 stars the beginning, however now I can not use them. Whether I am on the phone or listening to music, all I hear are muffled sounds. I had to order a different brand. Plus these don't stay in your ear all that well"
I'm loving this handlebar holder. It fits perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this brand for other phones as well.  Update: After almost TWO MONTHS of road use this phone holder broke off its base. I guess the normal road vibrations just took a toll on this holder. I am going to have to take away 2 stars. What a shame. I really liked this thing!
"This low profile power adaptor provides two USB connectors so we can charge two phones, phone and iPad, etc.  I like the low profile -- when you don't have anything plugged into it the cover on the power plug folds down almost closed (I have another non-low profile adaptor and it sticks out of the power plug like a short hot dog)"
I bought my Jawbone Up Move at Costco. I went back to buy another for a friend And 2 for my daughters! So obviously I want more to share this awesome little device with peoe I love.  Love that I don't need to charge it. My fit bit was a pain in the butt to charge and wasn't accurate when the battery was low. I also love the app for reminders and advice. Don't LOVE the food tracker but I am truly using this for the activity monitor. Keeps you aware of just how active we really are - and you can also move more if you see you are low for a days goal.
"Bought back in April.  Yes occasionally it does make high pitch noise, like a mic at karaoke night, but it is not often and it does stop on its own. Yes, it is a BIG case, but the iphone6+ is a BIG phone!  Yes, the rubber nubs that close off the charger and headphone areas are a pain in the butt and it is best to open them using the little chili pepper thing that comes with the case. Yes, they eventually broke off, so the phone is no longer waterproof. Yes, I have dropped it at least 7 times while in this case, No it has not suffered any damage during this time. Yes, the stand broke off last month, so it only lasted around 4 months of constant open close use. Yes, the chili pepper clastic thing is stupid, but it does work as intended, and i have had it tied to the core that it came with to hang off the corner. No, i have not lost the chili pepper this whole time. NO, it does not easily slide out of your pocket, front or back. Again, i think the phone size is more of an issue there, that the case. YES, you can use the thumbprint option, and it does work well, until month 4, it has started to wrinkle up and it takes a few tries to get it to read your print now. Can't give it a 5 since it is falling apart now, but giving it a 4 because it was $30 and it has lasted almost 6mo and has protected my phone form falls."
I wish I would have bought 2 of these now. It charges quickly and I get 3-4 phone charges from it.
Durable case.  Has good charge and protects from drops.
Works perfectly! Very pleased with this transaction.
"Looks great, can barely tell the film is there.  Haven't dropped my phone yet so unsure of the protective qualities."
"I used the phone in India.Right size to carry around and needed no alterations.Excellent reception,and clear sound.<br />Used for a month and quite happy with it."
"Bought this for a trip to the UK and was very happy we did.  Found a lot of the hotel rooms didn't haven't outlets near the bed so it was very handy to be able to charge with the external battery.  We have also found it extremely useful back in the states.  My husband likes to cycle and he uses it on his long bike rides since the Map my ride app drains his Iphone 5 battery pretty quickly.  It is on the larger side but that has not been a problem for us at all.  Our family loves it and my daughter just asked if she can have one for Christmas.  If size and weight aren't an issue for you I highly recommend this one.  For us, having more charges was more important than having a compact external battery."
"5 stars ONLY because I want to be heard. DONT buy this case because it is not as shown in the picture. In this picture the florals color is hightened but when u received the package it's not. It's light and pale. Also, it isn't smooth like someone actually painted the thing and tiny frozen paint is stuck on it. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this!"
"Very cute case, I loved its protection . The only thing I didn't like is the charger doesn't fit in the phone with the case on."
"Arrived on time and as described. Great product, thank you so much!"
"I really enjoy this radio. but the down fall is that I don't know how to program this radio.<br />The price is great, and it's great for airsoft games or any other activities."
This otterbox was a lifesaver but it broke late week when I wad just touching the rubber part. I was barely touching it and it snapped. I can't return it or replace it because the 30 days have passed :(
"The metal bit that charges the ipad, snapped off in the ipad, about 2 weeks after we bought it."
"This was the perfect upgrade to my Aux cord mess.  This device paired easily with my iPhone and the sound quality is a notch better than I expected.  The controls have a nice form factor.  The buttons can be identified by feel, which is important while driving.  I was so impressed that I bought a second one for my other car.  Great value."
"Would have given this item 5 stars, had great battery life loved magnetic heads!! However, headphones quit working right at 37 day. They no longer charge or power on."
"This was so easy to put on and fit my perfect! I have been using it a couple months now and really like it. I have not dropped my phone with it on so I don't know how the protection in that way will be, I'm hopinh good. I had dropped my phone three time before I put this on it. I think maybe it had made my phone easier to grip. Does take up more room in my pocket but that's ok."
does not work  will take it up with the seller.
My previous glass screen protector (from another company) was put on my phone at the ATT store.  I was afraid that I would mess up if I attempted to change the screen protector myself.  The one I bought at the store would've cost over $30 if it had not been for my credit.  I was weary about purchasing a cheap glass screen protector. This screen protector has exceeded my expectations.  The Maxboost website has a great video for how to install and the product included everything needed.  Hopefully it last a while.
Battery life doesn't last long. I would recommend buying a bigger size.
its okay!!! or my arms are too thick for it !!!  I would give it 5 stars if it was for women or someone with thin arms.
"Works well enough for what I use it for (spare/backup phone) but has a number of annoyances.<br /><br />Good: Solid construction, nice textured back for grip. Call quality seems okay. I don't use any of the other features like games, camera, bluetooth, etc so can't really comment on those. Battery life is great. Very small/portable, easy to throw in a spare pocket.<br /><br />Meh:<br />-Phone makes three loud beeps every few minutes when the battery is low, even on silent mode as far as I can tell. Haven't found a way to turn this off.<br />--Web browser button on the main screen with no way to disable it. Could see myself accidentally hitting this and eating up prepaid minutes. Tracfone's data is pretty expensive.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />-The &#34;flip&#34; part of the flip phone snaps closed very quickly and forcefully and have more than once pinched my thumb in the top corners of the phone when trying to close it with one hand.<br />-Tracfone charges you fractions of minutes for text messages, but only if you actually open them on the phone. On this particular phone, it shows you the sender number (or name if you have them in your contacts list) but *not* what time the message was received without opening the text message and incurring the minute deduction. I use this phone as a secondary phone where text messages are sent to both my tracfone and my email account, and a lot of times it's difficult to tell if the messages that end up on my phone are new or not (may have already read them on my email). Have wasted prepaid minutes finding this out.<br />-Occasionally advertisements for extra minutes will be sent to your phone as messages. These look like text messages at first and your phone will vibrate/make a noise, but when you open them they're a special type of message and you're not charged minutes for reading them. But still annoying when the phone makes you think you have a text message and it's actually just a Tracfone advertisement."
"If you buy a Garmin, you have to buy this too.  Period.  YOU NEED THIS.  Ignore your innate desire to save money.<br /><br />I had a Garmin before and balked at spending so much extra money on top of an already expensive purchase.  I thought the included mount (the type that sticks on the windshield) would be perfectly sufficient.  I was very, very WRONG.  This is not just a preference; it is a matter of safety.  The windshield mounts do not work reliably enough.  They fall off all the time, no matter how well you attach them.  I had finally gotten mine to stick and then was driving on a crowded highway when the mount suddenly came loose and tumbled right at me.  Potentially, this could have caused a major accident; luckily, I only swerved slightly as a result.  However, that incident scared me and convinced me to invest in a good mount.  Frankly, I also felt that if I had spent so much on the Garmin itself, all that money would be wasted if the Garmin committed suicide by breaking free from a windshield mount.<br /><br />This particular mount is very easy to attach to the Garmin and also comes off easily when you need to take the Garmin inside for updating.  It has enough weight to it that even when you swerve suddenly because of an idiot on the road, the Garmin doesn't budge.  It's also nice being able to shift it around a bit depending on where the sun is shining in.  I think the safety considerations alone make this worth the expense, but the additional convenience and ease of use make it an even better purchase."
"best screen protector ever way better then the cheap plastic sheets we have all been using I will buy one of these for all my needs (phones ,tablets Ipads )"
Worked great and saved us lots of money as Verizon did not carry replacement battery for our phones. Would have cost us New phones.
"Great concept, love having all the different cord styles all in 1 convenient cord. Took this traveling and it was so easy to charge our devices. My only grip is when 2 devices were plugged the charge was slow for one or not charging at all until the other device was fully charged. Wish you could charge multiple devices quickly at once but besides that I love it."
Did not work right out of the package. Had some dirt stuck to the micro usb port. Had to return......Very disappointing!
"I have been using the vibe for awhile now and I love it. It doesn't feel overpowering or impairing like energy drinks or alcohol or rx meds. I don't enjoy the side effects of either and tend to stay far away from them. Which is super important to me bc I am a stay at home mom trying to keep up with some really rambunctious kids but also keep my sanity. Sure, after a really long day with crabby toddlers I slap a calm strip on and feel like I have been sent to cloud 9. No glass of wine can do this, and I am so happy it's my own body's response rather than alcohol destroying my body. I leave the settings at 50% bc much higher I get the tingle feeling in my scalp. Otherwise, no issues. This thing is awesome!"
Great looking case!  Fits great and sticks out about an inch past the screen to provide plenty of protection in the case of a drop.  UPDATE: Revising to 4 stars because I have the Ceramic White back and there are small but visible &#34;polka dots&#34; that make the phone appear dirty (see photo).  Apparently all the clear cases do this but just a warning to those with the Ceramic White case.
"I have been using this continuously for several weeks and am completely satisfied. This is a very high quality product. It doesn't heat up at all even when charging all devices simultaneously which include multiple I phone models, and multiple I pad models. It charges fast even when all devices are connected. It is hands down the best charger I have ever owned."
If you work out and sweat daily then these overpriced earbuds are not for you. I did not get mine from Amazon I got mine from Best Buy with a 2 year extended warranty and that was only a month and a half ago and they've broken on me twice already I feel like I spend more time driving to Best Buy then working out!
"ordered for colleague in West Africa, he seems to be enjoying it"
"At first I didn't think this case would be too good at keeping water out but boy was I wrong. Works just as it should and item was exactly what was described. I gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 because you can't use earphones while the case is on. That is the only negative I could find about this case.<br /><br />Also, I was sent this case at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Definitely recommend."
"As described, great price and fast shipping"
"Bought it for my girlfriend and she uses it all the time, looks nice on her phone."
Awesome! Saved my Nexus 7 from being discontinued.
"Case did protext against a fall or two, but it is too flimsy and sticks too much to be functional in someone who wears jeans that fit them.  If you wore some 90s jncos, (or had a purse, I suppose) then this case would be a pretty good case.  I am keeping it as a stand-by."
"This case is awesome, full protection at a fraction of the cost"
I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />These cables arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assembly.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with these cables.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
The WeFix website had many tutorials.  It took some time but I was able to fix it.  There was one small piece which I couldn't figure out but I saw it in another video on the website.  After that everything went well.  The phone looked and worked good as new.
"I bought this desktop charger for a cruise that our family took. The cruise line did not allow power strips, so this desktop charger worked perfectly and replaced the multitude of chargers in our home after the cruise. We use the charger for all our devices; iPhone 6, iPhone 4, Kindle Fire and Nook."
"Yeah it fits perfect adds great cushion if your phone drops and lands on it's corners or back, you should invest in a sturdy shock absorbant screen protector also"
"Great to find a battery for this old phone (I don't want to upgrade), but the new batt does not hold a charge as long as I would expect from a new batt."
"I had thought these were going to be great chargers for our phones and tablet.  They aren't that great. I'm disappointed with them. They just don't charge or they charge mega slow. But for the price I paid, I guess I can't complain. I will say this though, delivery was fast and efficient."
"I love my new iPhone case, it's exactly what I wanted. Delivery was so fast, I would recommend Amazon to my family & friends ❤️"
"The concept is great, but this case did not hold together very well. I bought it for my daughter and she had it a little over a month and it started coming apart at the seams and the plastic piece that actually holds the phone broke."
good product at a great price
Very disappointed.  This was likely a counterfeit item.  I bought 2 batteries. One could not hold a charge for more than a couple hours. The other had only about 70% capacity of a regular battery and a self discharge rate that made it unusable as backup.  I am disappointed with Amazon on this purchase.
"Terrible pieceo f junk. Has never worked to actually charge a phone. Phone will occasionally make a 'hissing' sound when it seems like it is lining up with the device to charge. Battery level does not increase. Attempted to charge Nexus 5, 6, & 7 with the device and none would charge.<br /><br />Avoid this."
"Arrived on time, looked like the picture shown on amazon. No issues"
The item did not work as expected - but the company was awesome to work with!!
"GOT THIS PHONE FOR MY MOTHER AND SHE LOVES IT.THE LARGE NUMBERS MAKE IT EASY TO USE AND THE RING TONE IS VERY LOUD.SHE ALSO LIKES THE HANDY LCD LIGHT WHICH SHE USES TO GO OUTSIDE TO LET OUT THE DOGS AT NIGHT.IT'S RUBBERIZED BODY MAKES IT EASY TO GRIP,AND IT FEELS VERY STURDY."
"I have to say I am a bit impressed at the solid construction of this aluminum stand. It has a sturdy feel to it. It is adjustable for angle, making it easily viewable on my desk whether I place it on the low portion of the desk, or up higher near my monitor. The adjustment button is solid and holds well so it will not fall. The rubber feet give it good traction. It is painted with an &#34;Apple like&#34; color and texture so while it does not match my IMac perfectly, it is close enough where it does not look out of place next to my monitor.<br /><br />The only negative is that I cannot charge my IPhone 6Plus or IPad while it is sitting upright on this stand. I can turn the device sideways while it charges. If there was room to have the cable attached while sitting upright this stand would be perfect for me. Yes, that is a minor issue, but this is a review so I am just stating my thoughts. Overall this is a great product.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
"Phone case is very thin. It also is very smooth which makes it hard to not drop it every time I pick it up. It is a very cute phone case with a really nice design, but if you're going for something that is both cute and durable, I wouldn't recommend this."
"I love the phone except it doesn't have UBER app functionality as of  August 31, 2015. (I tried the mobile web version, but it doesn't work.  Error message says to download the app.)  Hopefully this comes soon, but for now I'm stranded.  I will update my review as soon as I find a solution.  I might be close.  I tried using the mobile website recently and it might be working.  I will verify as soon as possible (9/4/2015)  To research this issue, search for mobilityarena article uber-app-for-android-not-working-any-more-on-bb10."
The phone cover was purchased with the need of having more grip for my not so nimble fingers. It works great. Shipment was prompt and no problems. It serves my need very well.
"This mini-sized car charger can go along way! Being so accustomed to see chargers that are quite large - when I opened the package I was quite surprised by its size. And quickly asked myself how can a charger so small in size have all the functions that a normal larger charger has?<br /><br /> The ALBK Car Charger is quite sleek and professional in its design and is extremely light in weight - enough to fit in your pocket without even noticing. At the same time, having two ports with this mini gadget is extremely helpful as often times my family and I would struggle with the charge on our phones whilst travelling long distances - due to the shortage of chargers. I occasionally tend to use my phone quite often so this charger comes extremely handy especially due to having the fastest charging speed of 2.4A. This charger can also charge quite a variety of products including (iPhone, iPad, iPod, Samsung, HTC,Nokia Smartphone,Sony,BlackBerry). Another added bonus is that this charger is extremely safe as it turns off automatically when the charge is complete.<br /><br />The question then arises? Why bother investing much into those huge chunky charges which take much of the room - when you get this charger which has speed, durability, compactness in size, safety, and convenience for a very affordable price! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Did not work.
My husband is very pleased with this Radio Wire Harness. It simplifies the wiring of his radio in his new truck and he is happy with the ease of doing so. Highly recommend for the beginner wiring process.
Horrible quality do not buy. Armband feels like its going to rip when applied on arm. Does not stay put.
"As of today, this watch is compatible with the iPhone. Download Android Wear for IOS from the Apple App Store and pair! Enjoy!"
"This influence bank is justified regardless of the cash you spent. I utilize it to charge my iphone 5s and it effectively charges it 2.5 times before getting depleted out. The DUAL USB Feature helps me to charge two gadgets together. Sunlight based Charging Facility can be made utilization when emmergency, cool device."
"Case fits perfectly. Speaker ports were already cut out, and the perfect size. Its not as diesel as it looks, but its an ok case for the price. The holster clip is surprisingly strong as well"
"This is the third Moto e 2nd generation I buy. First I got 2 two for my parents and now one for my sister in law, and it is amazing. For the price you get way more than what you expect. Even when it is a budget phone it has features that easily knock the competition, specially on performance."
"I really like all the features and hardware of this phone, battery life is good, camera is good (not the best but gets the job done) The only thing I don't like is the software, this phone is not very popular so phones like the M8 will have priority even though this phone is technically newer. I stayed at kit kat because of many users that complain about lollipop, Other than that, I really like this phone, I just wish it was a bit shorter and smaller for a 5.2 inch display phone"
"Cool. A little bit more cheaply made than I originally imagined, but cute nonetheless. Doesn't come with a wall plug, so you'll need to buy that separately."
"The card slots are able to only hold one card each, the faux leather tears pretty easily. Good starter to see if you like to carry around one article as opposed to wallet n phone.  I plan on buying a good quality one next,"
It is protective and unobtrusive. The buttons on the phone all work well. I like the material and translucent look.
"Fit: I've always had issues with in-ear headphones staying in my ears while I run.  I didn't want to buy anything too expensive, so these seemed perfect.  They do a decent job of staying in my ears while I'm running/sweating.<br /><br />Bluetooth Sound Quality/Range:  The Bluetooth range is pretty weak - no more than about 4 feet before I have connection issues.  Sound quality was a little better than I expected - but don't expect them to rival Bose/Beats/etc.<br /><br />On a side note, they do a great job of muffling the sound around you - so I would recommend being extra vigilant while you're running with these or leave one earbud out."
Works perfect on my LG G Stylo.
Works great for my Galaxy S3 with slim case!  My phone never fails to charge (as it does sometimes when I plug a charging cord in)
"Great alternative to those who have an older model vehicle, works great when you find the right station. Thanks"
"Love my mophie juice pack, I work long hours and often use my battery pack.  I have dropped it several times and the case actually is quite protective as well !"
I really like the feel of this case it's not very bulky but it feels substantial and high end.<br /><br />The wings are very unusual but cool. Until they broke and then the whole thing was extremely annoying. Its like the magnet wasn't strong enough to hold them to the case.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this case.<br /><br />Product provided for review purposes
"Like previous post points out that the LTE on ATT is not working properly due to ATT network can't handle MTU 1500 setting properly.<br /><br />Good news is that it has been resolved by ATT and StraightTalk recently and the Z289L shall work fine now on LTE. Nothing need to be done by user or the device. I have tested this device in couple places at ATL, MIA, DFW and LTE works terrific!"
"I used it with my phone LG G4 and I didn't like it at all. It charged very very slow compare it with the original charger from LG.<br />-<br /><br />I changed my rating because of Aukey stuff, they contact me and help me, also offered a full refund.<br />They are really great even that the charger doesn't work well with my phone it works with Iphone.<br /><br />Thanks Aukey ❤."
I actually ended up inserting it upside down in my CD player so it wouldn't interfere with other button functionality and it works great. I really like this.
"Not accurate cable,did not fit Nook as described."
I've had this charger for around 7 months or so with no problems.
"I have trouble with Bluetooth earpieces and never finding a comfortable fit.  I have always tried the on ear headphones or the ear buds.  This is my first in ear Bluetooth earpiece. I found this ear piece to be comfortable and easy to use, it doesn't bother me as much as I had expected it to.  It pairs really easily with my iPhone 6.  I just pressed the button on the Bluetooth in ear head piece for a few seconds, saw the flashing red and blue lights and I was able to see the device was detected by my phone.  Once I successfully paired it to my device, I haven't had to pair again since.<br /><br />I had to test it to see the sound and how well it worked, since some Bluetooth headsets give an echo.  This headset did not give me any echoes when using it.  You answer the call by simply pressing the button on the head piece.  I had no static with the device and has a crisp and clean sound when using it.  I experienced no issues with the headset and I was able to walk away from my phone for about 15 feet before starting to experience some slight static and interference with the headset.  I don't normally walk away from my device while using it, but its nice to have the option and knowing that the caller on the other end will still be able to hear me well and vice versa.<br /><br />This headset comes from chin,  so it is equipped with voice prompts in English as well as Chinese.  Since I don't speak Chinese, I do not use that feature and stick to the English language.  To switch languages, hold the button down and it will switch languages.  The device also has a pleasantly long battery life.  I have used it numerous times without needing to recharge.  I also don't use it very often which would account for the long battery life.  Overall, this headset performs as expected and is also undetectable with my hair down.  Its a well made ear piece that I got in nude.<br /><br />Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Really cool and handy but why have a wireless charger that is connected to a cord. I think the charger should have a built in battery so you can charge the charger and take it wherever
"Shipment received faster then I had anticipated ! Great product just as described, couldn't have asked for anything more."
"The new Droid 4 phone works fine. I did not receive a SIM card with this order, so I used the one on my old phone Droid 4."
WARNING....Does NOT fit a 5S... too small. Nice case but cannot use it and dumped it.
"This is a great product. Or it would be. However, it claims to work with apple products but when I called tech support for connection issues with my macbook pro, they said it isn't actually made for apple products but for android, and they are working on updates for the iphone 6. Box clearly states it to be compatible with apple. They offered to take it back but we now know how to fiddle around with it to get it to connect with the macbook. So we just kept it as we like the product, and we keep manually reconnecting it. UPDATE- even with fiddling around, it doesn't consistently connect. We've been speaking on the computer phone on speaker, which is highly unprofessional and unpleasant."
"I wore this tracker to my first water class today. After class misfit fell out of band, and will not recommend"
I'm a student and i take notes on my iPad and use the stylus to draw arrows and small pictures and the tips only last a couple days each. They gave me s full refund which was appreciated. The tips are hollow so they're just asking to rip through and scratch your screen with the solid metal base.
"Ok first off I'm a long distance hiker and train during off trips up to 10+ miles a day after work. Now that being said I wanted a device that was accurate (this one isn't) and reliable with SUPPORT! Every time I plugged this unit in the software wanted to update the firmware. GREAT! Of course that's a good thing but after 3 disappointing chats no one could figure out how to get it to actually work. I used the forums tried everything could not get it done it kept giving me the same error. I then would connect to chat and no one would answer even 10 minutes after saying hello and reviewing my questions which were simple. (How do I update firmware, How do I reset Odometer) I had a few other questions but their manual is lacking SUBSTANCE and makes you fumble around. I needed something I could open the box and start using. I don't geocache so that feature is useless the camera is a joke Hello 2003 called they want their camera back (why is this even on a gps?). My biggest grip is with Magellan their support was RUDE and constantly cut the chats off even if the problem wasn't solved! Their phone support was just as bad again RUDE and inconsiderate. For $300 I expect top notch support this wasn't a whim purchase. But I guess I should thank them since I went to a similar Garmin Unit i'm quite happy with support and more features. STAY AWAY from this device."
this has been a life saver when it comes to having to &#34;charge&#34; as we are driving from point A to point B. The G'kids are much happier when their electronics are working and I am less bored if my iPad or Kindle is charged. Plug this into your cigarette lighter and you are setup 4 usb ports and 3 DC outlets. These inverters have a tendency to get hot but this model has a great little fan that keeps the temperature down. The cord is ample length but if the cord was slightly longer it would be PERFECT. [of course perfect length depends greatly on where the cigarette lighter plug in is located] I would buy again [it would be great to have one in every vehicle] AND I would recommend to a friend without hesitation.
"Case looks good and provides good protection, and the stand feature works well. It could be improved by adding a hole or slot to the front flap so that the camera would work even with the front cover folded around the back. One weakness of this design is that it does not allow for car dash mounting. I found a workaround, but incorporating some means of doing this would be a great improvement as well. My case was shipped to the wrong location (an error on the part of USPS, apparently), but one irate phone call to Amazon customer service later, the error was rectified, and I got the case, albeit a couple of days late."
"It worked for two weeks then it would not ring when a call came in.  Tried adjusting settings it did nothing to help then in the third week the 1,2,3 keys all stopped working.  This rendered the phone useless."
Absolutely love this screen protector
Despite some reviewers concerns that this case was difficult to install I had no problems.  It isn't as bulky as more expensive competitors but provides a similar type of protection.  For the price this case/protector can't be beat.
"Bought for my kid - works great, but not sure what the plastic back is supposed to do...it barely stuck to the back of the phone..."
"Had it sitting on a bed two days after I got it. Come back in a couple of house later, to find it sitting on the floor, and te little cover that opens and closes by the charger a lot at the bottom of the phone, was broken off. Now a month later, have not dropped it at all since that day, and the sidings are starting to come off.<br />Do not get this case. It is not worth the money."
Easy and fast to connect to my iphone 6. On my phone it tells me how much battery is left on the headphones which is a nice feature. Two gripes are that the batter does only last about 6-8 hours depending on how much you use the buttons on it - and there is no carrying pouch/case to protect them. Great for running or at the gym with no wires. Would recommend to buy.
"All the tools given with the product is helpful if you use them carefully.<br /><br />I used a hair drier and it didn't work enough to loosen the glue and i broke the lcd underneath. :(.  I'd suggest to spend some more bucks for heat air gun. The string broke since glue was hard.  They gave a spare string and that's nice.<br /><br />In short,  Good product and clear instructions."
"This is the second one I have received due to the first one falling apart just a week or so after receiving. Im hoping this one holds up a little longer. The replacement policy was great however, and a replacemenr was shipped in just 2 days."
Great Bluetooth headset with professional processes and shipping. Very easy to connect to Bluetooth and the sound quality is great. I love using them when doing yard work around the house and when exercising. I did receive a discount and recommend these speakers to anyone that loves music has much has me.
Its a great product.  I already own several.  I purchased this one because I wanted a lighter weight one to carry on a daily basis.  Its not much lighter then the bigger ones I own.  Not enough to make a difference.
Love the leather - it smell like wonderful leather
Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design
"The texting is really annoying, however it is a great little phone for basic needs. I killed my my more costly smart phone, and find that not paying data and just using the basic features is really all I need."
"I spend a huge amount of my time listening to music when I am working out, cleaning the house, or working in the yard. I own a ton of different headsets, but I honestly think this is one thing that you can never have too many of.<br /><br />These are a really pretty bright green color that I love, especially since this shade of green just happens to be my favorite color. The cords are very vibrant and eye catching, so I love wearing these when I'm going for a jog in the evening if it is going to be getting dark while I am out.<br />The earbuds are comfortable to wear and stay in place while I am moving around.<br /><br />As far as sound quality, I have to say they are pretty good in my opinion. I'm not a person that is super picky, but there are great for my needs.  I found I can turn the volume up pretty high and there is a minimal amount of distortion. Keep in mind you do have to adjust the volume from the phone or MP3 player, there is no way to do this directly from the headset.  I received a pair to review, and enjoyed them. While I do prefer Bluetooth headsets overall, these are a really nice pair of corded earbuds. Good sound quality, fun bright colors, and enough volume to drown out the world. Thumbs up from me."
Arrived on time.  As expected.  Thank you.
"Awesome band for the price and excellent customer service. To me, it honestly feels like the same quality as the iPhone bands. Will probably buy a couple more in various colors. Good stuff."
A great product. I've dropped my phone hundreds of times with this case and it's still pristine. Plus their warranty service is amazing.
Power add makes the best products!  This is the third portable charger I have gotten from them and this one much like the others charges my Galaxy quickly. I am a Poweradd customer for life!
Case was exactly as described. Great Seller.
Great charging base. Works well and is easy to sit phone on and charge. Some other bases are much more finicky about getting the phone in the exact position before they start charging. This one is easy.
"Often indispensable, but occasionally flat out WRONG. Also, when I start it up it sometimes goes back to the previous search without being asked. (I would not get it again.)"
Get product! Fast shipment and good quality!
"Yeah, I know - it's just a cable, but Love, Love, Love! - where's the Love Button!? The Heavy Duty cable doesn't really crimp up or tangle so it's less likely to bend and break the wires inside - less likely for the cat to eat through it, too. Snug fit on connections on both ends. And with a six-foot cord, I don't accidentally yank it out of the wall when reaching to turn off the alarm in the morning. Without question - I'd buy another! Highly recommended :) If this review helps - gimme a 'Like' - I like to know if I'm getting through to you. Thanks!"
"I have owned a Boostcase before and loved it until the case broke, I reordered the new one and it worked fine for about 2 weeks until it started to fry my batteries. I could charge batteries without Boostcase on,but the minute I put on Boostcase it would kill the battery. So not only out of the cost of the new Boostcase but the two new Samsung batteries I just bought. So not happy at all with the purchase at all seriously DEFECTIVE!!<br />HOPE TO HEAR FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THEY BACK THERE PRODUCT - WILL LET YOU KNOW........"
"This is a great power bank! Two USB outlets, charged it up once in the month ive had it, used it 3 times to full charge my phone and it still has 50% battery life left! You can turn it off while not using it to conserve power!"
"Liked this unit due to the flexibility of media types it can play.  I'm sure you can find a better option, but it will likely not be in this price range.  The only negative for me so far is the display and the difficulty of seeing it in bright sunlight.  This said, I'm not sure I read a review of any competitors that someone didn't have this same complaint.  Sufficient power to satisfy most though it struggles a little to compete with engine noise, still not bad overall. Haven't used the Blue tooth yet so can't speak to that features functionality.  Look at the price and features and I think you can't really go wrong here at this price point."
"[[VIDEOID:b1307f68c35bdad477763bb69225e146]] The TechMatte Power Pod 2 Qi wireless charger is a great \\""disc style\\"" Qi charger.  It is a little larger than other ones I have tested.  (This is a good this as it makes laying your phone down on it easier).  The charger comes with a standard USB to Micro USB cable that you can plug into any USB port on your computer or laptop.  They do not include a wall adapter with this, but I have several and used one of my own with no issues.  Nice user guide is provided all though not really needed because it is basically plug in and use.  I tested this unit with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (with a Qi receiver installed), and had no problems with the Note 4 detecting the pad and charging (it does take a few seconds to detect the pad).  The build quality is nice, it is all plastic but I found no seams out of place and is put together nicely. Over all this is a great charger for TechMatte at a good price and I give it a thumbs up.  I was provided a unit at a reduced cost for my honest and unbiased review, I was not compensated to give a positive review my thoughts on the product are my own.<br /><br />Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review"
This product is very handy when it comes to charging. The company makes sure that if there are any issues with the product in which they produce they try and fix it right away.
I really like this case for my iphone 6 plus. It was received when stated. It is very convenient and stylish.
"Spend the money; don't use the cheap wireless receivers; mine didn't work; but once I attached this case all is good.  This back cover does make the phone slightly bigger and it will not fit the Otter Box Commuter Series case, but it does fit the Otter Box Preserver Series case & my Lockproof case; plus it allows you charge with the case on."
My son loves this case.  Shipping was very fast.
"These work well, but one had a defective battery compartment latch. I am using a rubber band to keep it closed."
"Good price for a good quality case. It took a few weeks to arrive, but otherwise no complaints"
Great price so I ordered 2. We tried them and they're both fully functional with no problems. Nicely made and look identical to our Apple cables at a much lower price.
"The suction did not stay attached to my dash board, so the unit was always falling down, especially when my phone was in the holder."
"Eh. Find a better case, it gets dirty wayyy too fast and it's hard to clean."
"Works just as advertized and charges faster than I anticipated, considering they are supposed to perform that duty at 60-70% of direct charging (probably my imagination).  Very nice low-slung profile that fits my Galaxy S6 almost perfectly.  Had it about a week, and no problems so far."
Got this at a discounted price for an honest review. This glass really helps I've ordered it 2 times if it wouldn't have been bc of this glass I would've had a cracked phone. Amazing!
"Have had it for a couple weeks. works very well so far, although it doesn't seem to charge much faster than the original chargers. i will be doing some traveling in the upcoming months then I will know if it proves its value."
"It does what it's suppose to, but needs to be replaced in no time because all the little jewel thingy's fall off easily."
"I find this thick and bulky.  I like the silicon or jelly covers much, much better.  It also falls off.  keep looking."
Worked great.  Looks like a new phone.
They do not work with our phones as soon as you plug them in you get an error notice on the phone or they charge for a few minutes and then the error appears. Spend the extra money and but the apple product or they will not work properly.
"Another excellent product from Anker. Works great, very well made."
"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:<br /><br />This is by far the smallest headset I've ever tried and it works quite well.  Range is decent, sound is good on both ends of calls, and the ability to plug in the other ear is great.<br /><br />It came with a plethora of ear pieces of different sizes and styles and several ear hooks if you don't like using just the ear piece (I found it works best with the swivel hook).<br /><br />The call quality is good (almost on par with my Bose in-ear headset), but the stereo is a little lackluster.  It isn't bad per se, just a little tinny and lacks punch.  I wasn't really expecting more though from such small headphones.<br /><br />I think the ability to convert them to stereo is what really sets them apart.  If you're looking for a single ear BT headset you can quickly convert to stereo for music and videos this is a great solution."
The LG Ultimate 2 LG L41C is an exceptionally great smart phone at the Amazon price (under $70.) and works very well with Tracfone.  I was able to transfer my previous phone number from my old Tracfone over to the new one along with all my minutes and activation time.  I would highly recommend this smart phone and Tracfone to any economy minded person who is wishing to avoid the high costs of long term contracts with major carriers.
"An easy to use mount.  Fits the handlebars well.  The safety cord that plugs into the earphone jack is a nice touch and has saved the phone from several plummets.  However, the ratcheting clip seems to be good for only half a year or so of near-daily riding before it starts to lose its grip on the phone."
"works great , and price was a great deal"
Has only been a month and a half and product is not working. Very disappointed especially when you're expecting a quality purchase.  UPDATE:  Update. As soon as I left my review I was contacted by Anker. They were very helpful and I received a new iPhone 6 cord to replace the defected one. Customer serve is great and they truly fixed this issue in a hurry
"It was a good idea, but I was never able keep the screen protector on. Brushing up against something would remove it."
These speakers are HORRIBLE. They are also pictured with a plastic horn but that does not come with them.
"This has been a great &#34;first radio&#34; for my 7, 5, and 3 year olds.  It holds as many songs as you will want to load... what I mean by that is that the MP3 songs are ordered and displayed numerically only.  There are no song or artist titles, just a number from 1 to x.  The volume from the built-in speaker is more than adequate for in the house or in the car.  We have found the battery life has been good too (we've had it for 6 months or so).<br /><br />We've used it on trips to let the kids take turns as DJ.  Even the 3 year old can manipulate the songs and volume without trouble.  Going down the highway in a minivan, it still sounds good even from the far back row.  We got it to let the kids learn to use an MP3 player, but searched far for one with a built-in speaker so that they were not damaging their hearing with headphones.  This is a really good product for the money, with the only drawback being that you cannot see song titles."
"its ok ,,but makes your fone freeze ,,if you don't belive buy it ,,I didn't think it would but I learned when it froze the first time ,,,is it worth it ? yea I guess ,I got cpl batteries now I never have my fone on charger just swiching batteries but takes a day to charge a battery on this charger"
"Didn't work for me.  The instructions didn't have enough pictures for me as someone who has never done this before. I used a heat gun and thought I was doing it right, easy, but there was some sort of screen behind the glass that popped off with the glass.  That thing cracked and split like crazy when I tried to use the wire to separate it.  I assume that secondary screen was important since there was some sort of important-looking tab connecting it to the phone that disintegrated as I tried to remove the glass.  Ended up having to trash the phone.  There might be better instructions on YouTube or something, but I wouldn't suggest relying on the included instructions or really trying to DIY at all if you don't know what you're doing."
"just like an otterbox, without paying $$$ for it. Dropped phone plenty of times, didn't break or damage the case."
It fits a need in great ways. It is sturdy and durable and should last for many years. Thank you for this product...
"If this was a little smaller it would be great but it fatigues my ear and I have to fiddle with it every so often.  I don't use it for phone calls so I can't speak to the call quality because I only use if for listening to YouTube, Netflix, etc.  I really do like it, just wish it was smaller or had a different size available.  If it could be made of a flexible material and not a hard plastic that would be nice too."
"I have a case but no phone. New phone would not work. Had to pay postage up front to get the phojne taken back..So, now I may be stuck with a case.. My son needed the phone but now I am not knowing about another phone by mail??? What if this happens again."
Unfortunately this product did not provide much range which made it useless as a desk phone headset.
"Great case. After spending over $20 for a crappy Spigen case, This is much better and looks cool too. I will buy another one for myself"
I replaced my non-working $20 back-up camera with this Pyle one. Installation was easy because the wires were already in place. Decent picture quality. Nice in daylight or pitch black night time. The only thing I noticed is it &quot;reacts slowly&quot;. My old one I had my Edge CTS monitor set for 2 seconds delay. This camera I had to set it for .5 seconds and it actually takes about 2-3 seconds to turn on. No worries. Seems to be much better quality than the last one I had. Hope it lasts!!
"Works right,  charges every time for me. The materials and workmanship is crap. The rubbber/foam that contacts the phone doesn't hold up.<br />One day,  just driving along my phone & charger just drops to the floorboards,  scaring the crap out of me. One of the joints came unglued. Yeah,  they just used a dot of Superglue to keep some pieces together.<br />I fixed it with some hardware so it's stronger than when I first received it,  but that's not the point. I shouldn't have to within two months of receiving.<br /><br />Tl;Dr great deal if you have the talent/skill to fix what falls apart.  I would buy again."
"The S6 as we know is a gorgeous device. I wish that I did not need a case for it...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Slim<br />- Gives clearance if laying screen flat on a surface<br />- Nice texture on the back, allows for better grip<br />- Buttons / ports are not compromised<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Don't expect Otterbox protection<br />- The rubber material can pick up fingerprints easily<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Provides good protection but it's meant more for aesthetics. For what it is, it's great...buy it."
"Worked well while it lasted on my iPhone 6s, but the rubber &#34;fingers&#34; that wedge into the vents broke off after a couple weeks. Disappointing."
"Awesome cables, great price"
"I connected the device as instructed and then found out the website had updated instructions that were the reverse of what was included in the packaging. I tried to contact the manufacturer both by email and phone for additional support and received no response after a week of waiting. That said, I don't know the quality of the product but I'm not a fan of the manufacturer based on the experience."
works great in my mother in laws Dodge.  But will not work on my 2013 Ford F150 Truck at all.  Good construction and holds the phone well.  If you have round air vents it will not work.  Has to be the rectangle with the square style grid.
"Out of the two different tempered glass screen protectors I have bought, this has to be the best quality that I have used. I am the type of person that drops my phone often and the screen itself has protected my phone. The screen protector itself really feels like a glass, not some knock off kind of glass. It has definitely cracked since I had it, but I can say that it is of GOOD quality. I would recommend this out of the other temper glass that I am testing out as well. Id definitely would repurchase this again"
"Only one size of ear buds which are uncomfortably large. Wouldn't recommend, there are way better choices. On the positive side the battery life is good."
"This case fits my galaxy s6 perfectly and it is slim and sleek looking, I love it.  My favorite case by far, the best part is that it fits into my armband for my daily runs without having to take it on and off.  Love the fact that I can get the protection I want for my phone without a big bulky ugly case.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
"Fits phone perfectly.  Two piece set which can be intermixed with other colors of same product.  Bright colors, stones stay on back of case very well.  Great case"
I received the 4th car charger today and it is the same one as the 3rd and does not work. I will now ask for a refund and try getting the nuvi 200 car charger from another dealer.  Very disappointed in this item.
"The Stallion iPhone 5 case is everything I expected. I like that I can plug in the headphones without removing the phone from the case/belt clip. Case is very durable and protects my phone very well.  I know this because I've already dropped my phone by mistake several times, and not a scratch!"
"It was not what I thought it would be .  Did not fit the phone, waste of money"
"Bought it on Prime Day. It worked great the first couple of weeks but then all of a sudden it quit working. I charged it via the wall socket and also tried charging it through my computer, both times the green light indicator was full but as soon as I took it off charge it died."
"Poor performance, I replaced my battery because I had to replace my broken screen so I figured I would do the battery while I was in the phone and rejuvenate it, but no... This battery doesn't last as long as my almost 3 year old battery did. Luckily I saved my old one and intend to swap it back out when I get the chance. Don't bother buying this..."
Exceeded expectations. Charges just as well as my fast adaptive home charger. Great product!
this case is absolutely perfect
Very pleased with my purchase!  Item is exactly as described. Much better car charger than what the cell phone companies try to sell you when you purchase your phone.
this was exactly what i was looking for to upload my music to my computer and you can also use it as a walkman like the old days
"This car mount is great to use. It is a little heavier and bulkier than I like, but over all great quality and works wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is a nice feeling as well and doesn't scratch your stuff."
"Great product. Looks great, feels great in your hand and very sturdy. screen is clear and still sensitive to touch. well done."
Fits perfectly and comes off pretty easy. I love the Speck cases but hard to take off. My only issue is the there isn't much of a bump or cushion to protect the screen from getting damaged if it lands face down. Other than that it's a great case.
"Not really one to write a review but I am one to read a review. Being that this is a great product I had to go on record and let everyone know. I've had  many headphones on my ears or in my ears so my 5 star rating is for sound quality,engineering and definitely price."
I love the color of this case. I love that it's protective but not bulky. I love the feel of the case.
"It chargers really fast on Samsung phones but for Samsung tablets, I didn't see a huge difference between the original charger and this. I thought the length of the cords would make a difference so I interchanged them and put them side by side to see the charging speed and it didn't matter. It just didn't charge fast enough."
"Very good for the technology of today. I only gave 3 stars because it's not very usable, the tech. needs to mature."
Came in handy while moving. I shouldn't have worn my moto 360 but I got the warranty so I wasn't too worried. Saved the screen multiple times.  Glad it came with 3 cause dust got under the first one and the second one got scratched real bad on a wall while moving the couch.
I verified that it is the model advertised but it did not fit the phone.
"I ordered one of these and the sliding door was impossible to open. I messaged the company to explain the problem, and they sent me a new one free of charge! The second case works perfectly--does exactly what it's intended to do!"
"In my 2003 BMW Z4, this product didn't work as expected. It plugged in and fit just fine to the back of the factory radio, but no AUX functionality. After cutting it apart, I noticed that it is missing the 1x 300kOhm resistor and 2x 0.022uF capacitors. If you wire the capacitors in series with the L and R wires, and the resistor in parallel in between, then your factory radio will work to recognize the AUX input.<br /><br />Overall, 2 stars because it didn't work out of the box and required a lot of modification to work properly. Price was cheap though."
Works really well and did not slip on my shower wall at all like my previous one I bought for 10 dollars more. I really like this product! My showers are extremely better without having to worry about getting my phone water damage.
"Fits my go pro good, but the nut stripped first time i tried screwing it on, luckily i have a giant surplus of gopro supply's so i stole a nut off one of the other mounts which didn't fit snugly in so i glued it, the material looks sturdy enough, looks and feels just like my gopro brand hat mount."
As described and fast shipping.  Satisfied customer.
Had this case for over two months and I still love it.  Enough space for up to three credit cards in each slot.  Stylus is easy to access for me.
I purchased 2 of these mounts for both of my road bikes and frankly I am VERY pleased with them. I used to have a quad lock previously and I feel this is even sturdier and love that it angles up for using the camera as well. During a local century several riders asked about the mount and seemed to really have lots of positive things to say about it.
I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents for this coming year. My daughter bought me one last year. Mine is a 15000mAh RavPower and I love mine so I wanted to get my daughters one too. I keep mine in my purse and if my cell phone needs charging I don't have to figure out where I'm going to charge it if I'm out shopping. They are also strong enough to charge a tablet as well. It is kind of heavy but so worth having around.
Plastic is a lot more flimsy than I thought it would be but the case was too cute to pass up.
I had issues with my first case and was able to troubleshoot very well with the company. After we couldn't find a solution they resent me product for free and now I have a case that is awesome and I love it. So not only is the product great but the customer service was amazing. Thanks :)
old phone for this technology (2015)...but still a cool phone. reminds me of the blackberry.
installed battery and worked great for a few weeks but now wont hold a charge. not worth the hassle of return shipping charges. should have listened to previous reviews
"[[VIDEOID:2341f14120dc21efbefe97676ba89d64]] Watch video here in HD on YouTube: http://youtu.be/7mK6GAnr80Q<br /><br />A great case to keep your iPhone 5s looking sexy and minimalistic. I usually have my phone naked except when I travel, I usually have a Mophie battery case when I do. This simulates a naked like feel when handling it however during my review I did find something that did not suit well. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Ultra thin case<br />-Comes with a stylist<br />-Comes with a screen protector (basic level)<br />-Very durable<br />-Flexible<br /> -Transparent however multiple colors are available<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cutouts are not precise, at least on the review unit I received<br />-Volume buttons are hard to press<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall this case is not bad, I really love how thin and durable it is. Just because I had issues with the volume buttons this lost a star. I also really like how it came with a screen protector and a stylist, especially considering how affordable this case is.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am a professional product reviewer and was provided this unit in exchange for my honest opinion."
"Do you like trying to piece together broken English? Do you enjoy the rage the comes with putting together a selfie stick with no instructions? Than look no further than the Urpower selfie stick!<br /><br />First of all, the English was heinous. I've traveled to 15 countries and I've never been more confused than I was trying to put this together.<br /><br />The instructions also must be focused on some older or newer model than my phone, because it instructs you to open the camera and click on the gear icon. Welp, the gear icon doesn't exist. So that was a delight.<br /><br />I guarantee that I was putting it together incorrectly, but my phone was very flimsy and loose in the selfie stick. I'm taking this bad boy on a road trip with me and am going to be holding it over the cliffs of Acadia in Maine? Probably not.<br /><br />I will return, 100%. I would not recommend this product unless you're some sort of engineer, speak broken English fluently, or have enough wine to give you some clarity on how to set this up."
It was nice initially but the diamond fell off pretty quickly. I couldn't find the lose piece so I couldn't glue it back together. I wish they stay on a bit longer.

I am on my second Linear Bluetooth Neck Loop. I used my first Linear neck loop for over a year before it quit. I find the bluetooth version much easier to use and much less of a hassle than wired neck loops. I strongly recommend it.
"The packaging was the OEM box in a envelope. After waiting 2hrs taking out stereo and trouble shooting the camera was defective. Here is advice, dot. Waist time wiring till you test first. The camera chasie was really high quality, the size was fine for a 05 Corolla."
Fits like a glove around my phone and it feels secure.
"This is an absolutely stunning case. The colors are incredibly vibrant and look painted on the back of this case. The silicone makes it easy to put on your phone and it's a soft case so no hard edges jabbing at you if you are like me and tend to put your phone in your back pocket. I like that it is a thinner case so it's not to bulky and it's easier to hold for someone like me with smaller hands. This case is definitely a great deal at less than $10. This is one of those cases that you will be so pleased with, you may never want to change it.<br /><br />I received this free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"My wife and I both bought IPhone 6's and we wanted slim cases. If you're looking for moderate protection with little bulk, this affordable case is a great option. It's sleek and has nice styling; plastic on the side and back and durable rubber on the top, bottom and corners.<br /><br />My wife purchased a comparable otter box symmetry and I like this better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Durable<br />Stylish<br />No loss of key use<br /><br />Cons:<br />2 piece design (plastic shell snaps over rubber)<br />Would like better grip on sides"
"Love this cord and the company.  When my cord suddenly stopped working, I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and promptly replaced the cord with a new one.<br /><br />I have not had a problem with the new cord."
"Nice, and easy installation. I have been using this for almost a month directly connected to my car's fuse box a permanent charging solution for my iPhone. Has been working great so far!"
"5 stars all day long!! Dropped it as soon as I put it on my phone, nothing, perfect! All the buttons and switches work and my signal is BETTER with the case on then off. Best investment I have ever made in a case, any brand, any material. Thank you for making such a awesome case. The only issue I have is sometimes it's hard to touch with the thick glass but I adapted to it."
Does the job the bass knob works. I am driving one sub so just buy an amp that's overrated for your sub and you'll be good
Best idea I had to up my iPhone photography game. Love how the wide screen expands the view of the camera and how this allows for all lenses to work with both the front and back camera. Great quality.
Dose this watch work with the moto G 3
"Pros:I love that I can put two cards in the case and don't need to carry a wallet. The curve shape of the case makes it easier to carry my phone around. Easy access to ports and pronounced power and volume buttons. The back snaps on/off easily and securely. Great price.<br />Cons: The case is a little bulkier than most cases. The shiny back of the case shows every fingerprint smudge. The front edge of the case is flush with the phone, so I can't face it down. There is a longer ledge around the camera opening that may impede the effectiveness of the flash."
"Bought this for my husband, who always had tangled ears cords. Now.. not so much ( as he only, puts one ear piece in his ear. The other one is tangled, but wrapped up and away). Happy with this simple solution to tangled cords."
Are u guys serious about this ?<br />I just got it today and as soon as I opened it i got so mad
This case is not only stylish but very functional. It keeps my phone protected from scratched snd I find the magnet to be bery secure.
"It worked great  until it fell off the windshield and the glass shattered.  Suction cup worked well for a few months. then it started falling off constantly. then one time it fell and did not survive. touchscreen is now non-functional.  Update: I called Garmin CS (800-800-1020, got thru right away).  Got several good suggestions for the suction cup.  clean glass and suction cup with rubbing alcohol (not windex) and micro fiber cloth. wet cup before applying to glass.  or try the portable friction mount.  And then, even though my warranty is expired, they offered to repair it for free (replace with refurbished unit).  I am very happy.   Performance wise, the Garmin is the best. So I am happy to stay with the brand,  I bought the friction mount on amazon an it stays on the dash solid as a rock."
Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design

"My boyfriend bought me this case and I love it (despite the blah look)! Charges up/is recognized faster on a Qi wireless charger than my boyfriend's LG G3 (with a Qi receiver attached to the back of his phone).<br /><br />A big big BIG CON is how it renders the audio port inaccessible. &#34;*** This wireless receiver phone case is designed to be used with original Apple iPhone only&#34; Yeah. I get that, but the OEM Apple headphones are Pieces of S. -.-<br /><br />Great charging phone none the less."
"This phone case is super cute, although expensive. I've dropped my phone twice with this case and both times the case has popped off after falling. Nothing has happened to my phone, so it does protect it, it just pops off after. I've had a couple of stones fall out, which is expected, but that's been before the fall."
This case is slim and sleek while still giving my phone the protection that I need. It took a little concentration to apply but I am VERY happy with my purchase and will be buying this brand again.
"Case is adorable, although quite bulky as I'm sure you can imagine from the picture of the item. Several of the stones fell off in the 3 month time-span I used this case for, but I was expecting just as much."
the power wire is ok for running some weak subs  RCA cables are cool  but the speaker wire is s*** and is a pain in the but to work with  so this kit gets 2 stars
"I started using the Super Bass of my friend and I loved, I had to buy mine. It is heard with good power and has good range. Thank you"
I am a fitness instructor and I use this to hold the transmitter for my mic.  I holds it well and I can move it around me as I change exercises.
"excellent cable, it even has a proper strain relief."
With 4.8a this charger does its job!
The battery was as described and much cheaper than any I could find locally.  I charged it up and put it in my phone and it has worked ever since.  Good price and fast shipping.
"WOW. I didn't realize an armband would actually fit my iPhone 6 plus. So I ordered this one to try it out. It is perfect. It fits my 13 inch arms (Hey, I'm a thick girl) great with a little room left over on the velcro band. The reflective strip around the screen is great. I love when companies think ahead on safety, as some armbands do not have that.<br />I am able to access the bottom port for my ear buds with no issue. The phone fits snug into the band, but I have to remove it from its case first. This is pretty much a given. However, my kid can use it with his iPhone 6 still in the case and it fits without any issue. The screen does not hinder the touch screen ability at all.<br />But I am unable to use the armband. I love my iPhone 6 plus, but it's too big for me to carry on my arm. It interferes with the ability to move my elbow because of the size. But, that's okay since again, my kid can use it with his  iphone 6.<br />I received a sample armband to test and use in exchange for my unbiased review."
"The cover looks used. There are so many scratches on the back of the cover. I am attaching the picture of it to let people know that the product is not the way its being advertised!!!<br />Total waste of my time and money,"
"Got this screen protector so in case he drops his phone it is protected. Love the screen, easy to put on."
These phone sleeves are so cool. They really work to protect our phones. We wear them in the gulf to take photos!
It's a wiring harness. Geez
Great case... Does anyone know how to attach the neck strap to the case?
Great Seller and Great Product!!!
Didn't fit my phone but seller was very accomodating.
"This case is awesome.  I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it.  But I love this case.  I closes with Allen head screws, has an almost glass type cover and is so heavy duty it is a wonderfully well made and durable case, made to last and take a beating."
"I looked at lots of screen protectors before finally deciding to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did.  The quality is great, you can't tell that you have anything over the screen as far as clarity goes.  I didn't have any problems installing it either.  I wiped the screen with alcohol, and then used a micro fiber to wipe it again.  The glass went on very easy.  So far I haven't had any problems with the edges lifting and I've had it about 3 weeks."
Great price easy to use.  Purchased for a tracking system.
"Looks great on my Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus, light weight matces the color of the phone great and does not take away from the beauty of the phone."
"Good headset for the price, but have had a couple of issues. It was initially easy to pair with my iPhone but have had the pairing fail several times for no apparent reason. I am just using it for my phone, primarily while driving, and had to switch to speakerphone when it happened in order to take the incoming call. Very distracting, so I had to pull over. The other issue is I find it painful to have on my ear after a while. My ear is on the small side, so that could be contributing to the problem. My old Headset sat on the outside of my ear and didn't have to be inserted into the ear like this one, so it was very comfortable. It cost twice as much, however, and broke right after the warranty expired, so I replaced it with this one. I am hoping that I will find a more comfortable way to wear it."
"The case provides excellent shock protection for the enclosed phone. But it's nearly impossible to reopen the case without breaking off the latches in order to access the SIM. While prying to reopen the case, the phone was in danger of being scratched which defeats the whole purpose of using the protective case."
", the case fits the phone very nicely. It is comfortable to hold."
Very good quality.  Better then the original.
I got a single 15 2 ohm in a 1997 s10 that I go to compitions with and with a 1500 watt amp I do right around 140 db so really loud and as long as you alow it to break in for a good time before you turn it up then the sub will last for a long time
"There is just nothing wrong with this phone case. I bought it because of the cute colors available. I wasn't even gonna try Otterbox because it's known for being bulky but this one I guess is the least bulky of all their cases. Even though it's thin, it still gives you the feel that it's durable and that it's gonna protect your phone from breaking in case you drop it accidentally. Would totally recommend this product."
Terrible - won't hold a charge.  Refurbished nightmare  -  if we hadn't been in such a bind I never would have bought this
Works as expected
"I have been really happy with this so far.  Great deal.  Good sound quality, comfortable, easy to set up.  Most earphones pop out of my ears that that has happened a few times while working out here, but i'm getting the feel of how to twist them into my ears."
"First of all, this (Gray/Orange) ASHIELD protective cover fits my LG Ultimate 2 perfectly and I can manipulate the controls with no problems.  The orange cover is soft and almost squishy.  The gray part is hard plastic.  This means I can maintain a good grip while holding my phone and although I feel confident the cover would protect it well from a drop, I cannot attest that it is &#34;Amy&#34;-Grade, LOL.  I don't use the holster, but it seems substantial and the belt clip can be turned for vertical or horizontal carry.  The holes line up and the cover does not negatively impact the mic, speaker, camera, or controls.  The USB port does have a flap that can be a little persnickety to open when you want to connect the cable. But, it probably most definitely helps keep dust and moisture out.  So it's a positive.  The picture accurately reflects the color and I've gotten lots of positive comments on how it looks.  More importantly, I can now spot my phone easily when I lay it down amongst my other junk or the cat lays on it.  I feel like I got my money's worth and I'd buy it again."
"To date this has been a good cell phone choice for my wife who favors screen size over portability. The phone is perfect for her, too large to strap onto my arm for a run."
"I got this product so that the Robotic Sphere would not be so noisy on my hardwood floors when my dog is chasing it. What I didn't anticipate was that when my dog catches it, she is able to puncture the soft rubber. So it is great on not being noisy--just not too durable."
"Very nice looking case, i dident want a case for my alpha cause its a really pretty phone as it is, but this case compliments it very well, looks nice and definitely looks like it will protect it from a good drop, though the way it was packaged(in a soft package) it got a little damaged, dident break the plastic but theres a bend in it, not returning it cause i dont want my phone to go unprotected for a week...  Update: owned it for a good few weeks now, still like it but had to deduct a star cause the gold color is peeling off around the edges, looks a bit ugly now, its not peeling on the back... yet."
"An excellent case at a very reasonable price.  My daughter opted for the light pink and really likes it.  It seems sturdy yet lightweight and the edge comes over the screen enough that I'm hopeful it will protect the glass if the phone is dropped.  So far, so good. Highly recommended!"
I recently got this adapter and like a lot of people mentioned it does skip several beats multiple times while playing the song.
"The sidewall is a bit fragile. The phone slid off the bed, about 2.5 feet and the side near the volume buttons broke off."
"Very easy to swap after watching a quick youtube video. Definitely worth it. My old port cover had broken long ago, and I didn't realize a replacement could be done so easily without taking it to a store. Probably took about 5 minutes total, including watching the video and messing with a screw that didn't want to budge."
"QUALITY: tested and it works DELIVERY: slow boat from China (expected): PRICE: low - minimal risk.<br />If you kept floppy discs and want to transfer to other media this unit has done the job. Looks like it will have limited life but if I get through my floppies, I will never need it (nor the floppies) again. Owning costs less than third party conversion for half a dozen floppies.<br />BARGAIN"
Just got it in the mail today. I purchased the green/gray for my note 5. Not as vivid as the green looks online. The case is light. Feels durable. Fits the phone well. Buttons function well. No issues with the touchscreen. Not real comfortable with the access ports to the charger and aux cord input. They are a bit tough to move back...as in the little flap pushes against the charger and the aux cord. Not an issue for now. But will come back to update how well it holds up after everyday charging and a lot of aux cord/headphone use.
"It worked for a little bit but then the little claps all started breaking off. And the little circle that shows the Apple symbol started cracking and it drove me crazy, so now I use a different case."
"Sound quality is great...as long as you move slowly or your phone is on a flat surface. If you have your phone (I have an iPhone 5) in your pocket or in a holster clipped on your pants or in a purse and walk briskly or run, the sound breaks up. This is the second Bluetooth headset I've tried that has the same problem and the other pair was from a different manufacturer."
This was not what I was looking for.  It didn't fit my I Phone 5C as recommended from the supplier.  I had to return it.
"Was a great charger... until it stopped working.  Only had it for 2 months and now whenever I plug it in, itll say that its charging but it wont.  Amazon says its past the return period, so now Im stuck with a dead charger case."

I know I won't be as nervous having my items out on the water now."
Very cute case but it really doesn't fit the phone very well.  I have a hard time with the downward swipe because the case is positioned too far over the top of the phone.  Spend a little more money and get a better fitting case.
A joke  melt me a product that have been returned it was broken the belt clip was broken and the case was cracked I'm pissed
-  the bluetooth is very bad if the phone 3 step away from the headset you loss the connect<br />-  the headset is alway fall from your ear<br />-  only good one is wenn the call coming you just take it and put in your ear ...you ready to talk ...don't need put any button only this i like ...the ton is ok
Cheaply Made. Breaks easily.
Very Fragile.  Did not last a week on my Son's phone before it was shattered
"I ordered a replacement battery for my Samsung tablet.  It was kinda hard to get the case open and the old battery out but after that, we inserted the new battery and my tablet is like new again.  Great purchase from Amazon."
"Fits perfectly, works for every port on ipod except for headphone/aux cable jack... the aux cable that I have is too wide to fit into the jack when the case is on."
"I have tried other Bluetoothsbut they never fit or sound right I found that all the Motorola ones that I tried satisfied . I saw this one a great price so, I bought it ."
Just  as described.  It makes me feel like I have a brand new phone...
"No complaints so far. I had feared they may not be Apple Certified, but all my devices are accepting them without any issues."
Free sample from AMZ.<br />Nice package and fast delivery.<br />Not hard to open.<br />Clear guide to stick on the phone. High quality of glass screen protector.<br />Very easy to make it done.
"The pro charge power inverter is the perfect accessory to have when traveling. I usually let my husband drive so that I can read or catch up on work. I ordered the pro charge inverter to charge my laptop in the car. The inverter is easy to use. All you need to do is plug the cord in your cigarette plug. It can charge up to four devices at once, two using the USB port and two with the AC ports. I have no problem charging my phone, my husbands and my laptop all at once. The cord is 36 inches long and will reach the backseat of our car. This device is perfect for my family. I received this item in exchange for my honest review."
Great screen protector! It is not really thick so it looks nice on the phone. Barely noticeably on the phone.
Case is too big for my phone. Case covers up part of flash and phone slides around  inside case a little. Major disappointment.
[[ASIN:B00F3583S8 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Standard Battery]]<br /><br />The battery doesn't work and it looks like a used one.  Don't buy it from the dealer I pasted here.  It's a scam.
Very heavy and bulky (it's about the same size as my note 4) but it charges very quickly and is compatible with the samsung wireless replacement back for a note 4. The powerbank is made of pretty nice materials so it feels good to hold.
" It's not every day that you find a portable charger that is able to charge from solar energy, but is also shock and water resistant so that you can leave it virtually anywhere to charge and it'll still be pretty safe."
"Nice looking case, hard but soft, but the painting in the hard case start to scrape off a bit, no big deal, i love my case"
"This cable was exactly what I was searching for and had a very high rating. Upon reading the comments, I saw that a lot of the reviews came from reviewers that received this cable as a promotion. This was worrying to me, but since it was exactly what I wanted- I ordered it anyway.<br /><br />It was a good decision. This is my favorite cable I've ever used. It feels sturdy and syncs data. The ends feel like they're made of aluminum, the braided cable doesn't tangle when I put it in my bag and it fits my Otterbox Commuter case for my 6+.<br /><br />It's about a month later and NRGized (the seller) sent me an email stating if there were any problems to contact them and the cable comes with a 12 month warranty. Very good experience so far.<br /><br />I'll update this review if anything changes."
It's a very good pole. Fits my daughters iphone5 and she loves it. It stretches out far and it seems sturdy and well made.
Great charger that has saved me quite a few time!  Took this with me to Disneyland where we stayed all day. I was able to keep my phone charged all day which was perfect since I took a ton of pictures which normally drains my battery.  I was able to charge up two cell phones that day with one charge to this charger and that alone made this purchase worth it!
"Best case ever. Used for a long time. Coloring came off when I tried to clean it, or I'd still use it"
Great product.  Exceptional quality.<br />Will order another 1
It stays clipped to your pocket good and has a nice grip. Only gripe is that the kick stand is a little awkward and the grip on the inside of the holder catches the case when your taking it out.
"Hands down, the best earbuds you can get for under $100."
Only used 1 time doesnt work anymore 😡<br />Its a nice and small stick but that happends to me
I give 5 stars just because my brother said it work good for him.<br />He love it No complaints
"Simple fast car charger. Works as intended. Can charge two iPhones rapidly at once, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />5 stars."
Great product this is the second one ive ordered. They work great. I will be getting another
exactly as described. easy to push buttons if you are familiar with otterbox.
"I brought this phone in June and since I have had so many problems with I! It used a Samsung phone in the past years and I never had problems with it. But this phone is just catastrophic!!!! The follwong problems;<br />It sometimes charge properly and sometimes I leave it hours on the charger and it does not charge fully,<br />_sometiomes the battery runs out very quick (sometimes not!!)<br />Sometimes I can make phone calls sometimes not; for example, when I call a  number which I all the time, sometimes I am able to call and ost of the time it tells me &#34;not registered on the network&#34;!!!!<br />When I send sms' s or messages on whatsup or viber, sometimes they go on time and I receive messages on time, but sometimes it takes hours until I receive a message that was sent hours ago or vice versa.<br /><br />Those are just some of the problems I can recall now. I went couple of times to my phone carrier and they replaced the chip card assuming  it might be from them, but the same problems continued over and over again.<br />Don't buy this phone!! It cames with a looooot of problems!!!"
"Great color leather, holds cards in well (I've never had more than 2 in a slot usually one), stands the phone up at a good angle for viewing, love it."
I was able to get this product at a discount for an exchange of my review. The case fits my phone like a glove. I needed a new one since my old one was all scratched up and beat up from all the drops my daughter did while playing with it. With the new case it is as durable as my old one and have no issues with my screen not working or anything. My daughter has already dropped it a few times and the phone is safe! That is all that matters!!! The case saved the phone!
"The arm band I give a 4 star. It is comfortable and stays in place well. It also holds my I phone 5s very snug. The screen protector that came with it because you have to have it out of a case to fit, unless you have a small case, was already cracked when I got it. I was disappointed about this because I was looking forward to putting it on my phone."
"I've ordered multiple sets of these cables, to replace various USB charging cables that have worn out and stopped working.  These cables have solid construction and good connection when plugged in.  So far no problems with connector failure due to strain at the plug end.  Excellent value."
"Fits phone perfectly. A little struggle to get the phone out of the case, but I got it to protect the phone and will not be taking it out often. So okay with that."
Great cheap phone holder. Stays in the vents well and doesn't scratch them. Will buy again if I accidentally leave this in a rental car or something.
"This has to be by far the best screen protector I have ever used - aligns perfectly to my Zenfone 2. This was the FIRST time in my life that I've installed a screen protector without any air bubbles or dust, and the pain associated with them. Very happy with the purchase, and at a great price."
This is a very powerful power bank not those little sticks you normally see on the mall kiosk.  I have a Samsung note 3 with big battery so this is powerful enough. I can charge at least 3 to 4 times.<br /><br />The other thing I like is it looks so beautiful. The picture isn’t doing it justice. By the way it is made of bamboo with really intricate carving not wood.
"Works well, good price."
"works and does its function, great case"
"Works well, Looks great and so far, its very durable!"
I've owned more expensive wireless headsets but they don't perform any better.  This is my fav and when I've lost it and had to reorder... this is my go to headset!
"THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FROM A NEW COMPANY THAT HAS A BAD PRODUCT<br />after two weeks of the earpieces separated, exposing the wires. When i contacted the company i was told i had gotten a defective product, but they did'nt have any inventory for a few weeks; hoping i could wait.In addition, it took about 10 days to arrive when i first ordered it.The range of this headset is about 10 feet, whic is far less than my LG.<br />Per the company customer service, this is a brand new company located in Germany They clearly do not know what they are doing. I had an LG for 3 years with no problems...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. AVOID THIS PRODUCT"
"I originally bought this for my daughters Blu Studio 5 but i now use it for my blu life one X. The holes don't match up at all and I have to use my silicone case over the phone in the case but my daughter no longer needed it so at least it isn't going to waste. It has Two credit card slots, an ID card slot and a cash area."
Great cheap case. Only bad thing is that the kick stand is low so the viewing angle sucks.but the tech armor glass fits perfect.
My new iPhone 5 is my partner in crime while mountain biking or hitting the slopes. This tough and rugged case has turned my smart phone into a mountable action case. Really easy to use!
"It's a soft matte case that helps protect the camera from touching the surface you're setting the phone on (which is the main reason I even have a case on the phone) without adding bulk. The cool benefit is the port covers which actually do a good job. The buttons so an amazing job at preserving the tactility of the buttons. The material is such that it has a bit of abrasiveness to keep it from flying off of surfaces but it shows the marks/scratches...all in all, it's not a bad case. For the price, if you're looking for a slim durable case...this is definitely a good choice.  -Edit- I bumped up my rating, initially I gave it 4 starts because of it showing the scratches/marks on the back, but it turns out that they disappear after a while...to be honest, I bought a TON of cases for this phone, and this is still my favorite."
"Extremely slow performance.  Very frustrating to use.  Poor response on touch screen.  Cosmetically, looks great, but I could not get past the problems and returned it."
Great phone for the price!  Easy to use!
I bought it and now returning it since Im not very happy with it. The USB 4-5 inches cable that came with it was found to be very loose and not working with the Samsung S6 edge I recently bought - while driving I tried to put my cell on but it kept on coming off. Now its a different story that you can buy a pack of 5 USB cables (of 4-5 inch each) on Amazon for just 3-4 bucks - so it may not be as serious issue may be. Secondly this charger didn't come with its own charging cable  You got to find one of your own. Everyone has one but that was kind of unexpected. Also while on my recent trip I put it on charging with my cell phone also hooked up. Next day morning I found it had only 2 blue lights on - not all the 4. So the continuous charging didnt really work for me. I am just sending it off.
"Placed on phone quickly, perfect fit, nice color.. seems very sturdy. The price is right"
"case really nice but back hook (which also has a belt look) was just glued on and came off within a week.  Sorry, but not made well"
I just received this cord and it seems to work find but does not fit through the iPhone 6 Otterbox case. The opening to the case is too small and the end of the charging cord is bigger than the original cord. It does work with my sons iPhone 5s Otterbox and my iPad case.
"I bought mine for the LG G2, and I'm leaving this review on the product I purchased. So if you're reading this for a different phone, it's because Amazon lumps several product's review pages together.<br /><br />I've had it a little over a month, now, and it's got all kinds of little scratches on it. Not sure how, I've never set it face down, and I never put anything else in the pocket it's in. Took a slight impact on day 2, so it also has a chip in the side and a cute little crack to go with it. I feel like it was a very easy impact, and I wouldn't have thought it would have been enough to cause any damage. My guess is that since the face of the phone's glass is curved, the glass is just unsupported at the edges and more prone to breakage. Even if I hadn't had an impact, because of the unsupported glass, there's a very noticeable ring all the way around the screen. Maybe it's the best protector that could exist, given the design of the phone. Maybe it's the best that could exist at this price. But it's definitely not the best screen protector experience that's possible."
"Real good cheap replacement for blown speakers. Not loud or powerful though as you can guess, certainly not more than the factory speakers on most cars. However I can hear music and that's what they need to do. Good for a quick fix!"
"Just received it and love it, it has the feel of an otterbox. So far its getting a five star rating. Will update again after a couple weeks but I believe its gonna hold up to drops, and the style is awesome."
"Great phone! Ordered from Mobile Group USA. Was delivered  promptly, within estimated delivery date. Had for several months and the phone is working well. Rear camera takes decent pictures. Battery lasts typically for about 6-7 hours of usage. When on standby, battery lasts longer."
Does exactly what it says on the Tin
"Fast delivery, excellent product!"
Doesn't work with vents that the guides move vertically up and down. Holds your device securely though. Just really disappointed with the vent mounting.
"owning so many iPhone 6 in this house scares me to death to have without have a glass screen protector on them. The ones in the stores cost so much money and they don't seem to last that long for the price you pay for them<br />The Siania screen protector arrived and I was so happy because it came just in time when my daughters IPhone arrived:) I had my husband put it on and he said that it was easy to apply and it looks great on her phone. No smudges are anything. You can't even tell that it is on there at all:) I'm very happy with it and so is she. Normal screen protectors without the glass show so much that you just want to rip the screen protector off,but these you don't want to:)<br />I highly recommend this. It not only protectors your phone,but if it cracks usually its just the screen protector and at this price you can always get another one with no problem:)<br />I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done:)"
This should be bundled with Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interfance or it should be in the product description that when the Chevrolet Cruze has a steering wheel control it needs the Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interfance
"Jesus stop freaking begging me to review this, Amazon. Like a whiny two year old. God."
"I purchased this charger so that I could just plop my phone down on it when going to bed - and wake up with a full battery.  Unfortunately, that's not exactly how it works.  Samsung REALLY needs to upgrade the firmware on this device.<br /><br />If you place your phone on the pad to charge, it stops charging when the phone hits 100%.  That means, for the rest of the night, the phone is still sitting on the pad, but is now using it's own battery power.  It won't start charging again unless you pick up the phone from the pad and put it back down.<br /><br />This is a major oversight in my opinion.  The pad should sense when the phone is not at 100% and start charging again - WITHOUT you having to pick it up and put it back down on the pad again."
This case was perfect it fit my daughters iPod perfectly she actually connected the keychain to the case she loves it I give this five stars😊 I am happy with what I got
Loving it in every way. With the small exception that it doesn't have a hourly chime at the top of each hour. But a small price to pay. But no real complaints.
Worked great for a while. Then it would only read that the product wasn't supported by Apple and would no longer charge.
First off I'm huge on boxing and I love how the item is boxed. The sound is crystal clear which makes it hard to differentiate from a cd. I don't see why people rate it any lower than 4 stars. Just an FYI you DO have to have a stereo head with an aux input built in for the device to work. One thing that I forgot to mention was you can charge to of your devices at the same time which is awesome.
"I Wana write a review for wizard because I ordered four order of these cell phone holder/car mount. I'm using wiz Heart because it is functional, simple, and easy to I install.<br /> I'm gonna order some more for friends. Great job!"
The user manual is all but useless. They don't explain the steps in near enough detail. In my opinion this is not a user friendly dash cam. Still trying to get video to play on computer but the steps they say needed for playback aren't getting me there. Some buttons you have to hold for a period of time others you don't and certain buttons need to be hit before others. The manual says nothing about the ok button they ask you  to use. Just so you know its the record button and the manual calls it the confirmation key. ( think they could have just called it what it is THE RECORD BUTTON ) The manual totally amps up the aggravation in using this dash cam. If you're lucky or smart enough to figure it out I'm sure its a great little unit. I found the play back as I'm writing. It amazes me how a company can create such high tech. and then screw up the manual so bad. Is it to much to ask for a company to put just a little thought into the manual. The manual should say press X for 3 seconds then use the MIC button then when menu comes up here are the additional steps. Its just an absurdly written manual that assumes you know more than some of us do.
This is great.  I use it solely for my TV so that I can transmit from it to my headphones while I am on the treadmill.  I had been looking for something to give my TV a Bluetooth connection and both Best Buy and HH Gregg said it didn't exist so I was nervous about this at first but it definitely works.  The one complaint I have is the volume.  I'm not sure if it's attributable to the transmitter or the headphones I am using but I have to turn the TV volume almost all the way up to make it loud enough while I work out (not a huge deal unless I forget how loud it is and unplug the transmitter).
JUNK!A WASTE OF MONEY!FLIMSY NO GRIP!WORTH ABOUT $1
"Keeping in mind the price point of this pair of inexpensive Brainwavz Jive in-earphones, and comparing it with the in-ears' positive attributes, I can easily give it a five star rating:  Well-balanced sound, with decent vocals and instruments;  a very comfortable fit; lightweight housing;  gold-plated audio plug-in; a mic that works flawlessly and conveys your words crisply and clearly; nicely pliable, low memory cables; a classy look--with three color choices; four pairs of tips, (including a pair of Comply); and a nice, zippered, hard carry case (that other companies sell, similar but smaller, for ten bucks).<br /><br />Sound is easy on the ears:  Dynamic and energetic; (Brainwavz calls it &#34;lively&#34; and that is a good description.)  The sound is not muddy, flat or congested.  There is decent definition/resolution, good range, and a definite stereo effect.<br /><br />What you need to accept for this price point:  The sound engineers had to make concessions somewhere:  Bass is not booming (and that is not necessarily a bad thing depending on your point of view), and sound is not as rich and full as you get with more expensive in-ears.  Some depth is lost, but details are there.  Sound is somewhat &#34;laid-back&#34;, like it is coming from a bit of a distance.<br /><br />Of note:  Ear tip color match the color of the in-ears and cable, and I kinda' like that; (Comply ear tips are the usual black).  Cable is thicker below the mic, thinner above the mic, to lighten the comfortable feel even more, and I like that feature, too.  Brainwavz has re-designed their zippered, hard case by making it more oblong, instead of squarish.  It means you don't have to roll your cable so tightly and it is easier and quicker to fit it all back in.<br /><br />I chose the red and I'm very happy with that color.  It is a rich red on the metal housing--I might call it &#34;lipstick red&#34;.  The tips are a matching translucent red, and the cables are more of a deeper red to red/brown color.  Really nice looking, not garish at all.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Brainwavz.n color.  Really nice looking, not garish at all.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Brainwavz."
"LOVE THIS!!!! If you hate charging your phone and always being attached to a wall, this is perfect. The quality of the batteries is the same quality as the battery that originally came with my phone. I'm on my phone a lot so that used to mean I had to charge my phone a lot as well, but now when my battery is low, I just switch it out and recharge the other battery. I've had the batteries and charger for 6 months now and I'm still impressed. I definitely recommend this product!"
Glad to find the ones for my phone.... Up until now I have been cutting out my own... Really Happy!
Wasn't sure when we ordered these if they would be any good we've had them for some time now and they protect the phones very well.
I am highly impressed with it and can recommend for anyone as a great alternative for a power bank.
Works perfectly after you get it organized. Amazing ability to get super fun shot. Would recommend it to anyone.  Kind of a plug and play.
"Broke after about a month, not much space in the wallet space and it rips somewhat easily, I like it but i could be a little better made."
Have purchased a few of these and have had no problems with any of them. Highly recommend. NOTE: the plastic on the lightning end is wider than Apple cord so it doesn't fit in the slot of my husband's Otterbox Defender case but fits mine (not Otterbox) just fine.
Fit is not quite as great as the Commuter for the Iphone 3GS from a few years back. The case is a good compromise between protection and bulk.
"Works as described!  I applied this to the dashboard of a Prius 2013 and it sticks very well.  In addition, I have not had any issues with it coming off during the hot weather.  It stays in place.<br />Overall it works well."
The RoadMate works good.  Trying to update maps can be confusing.
I've had this case for a couple of weeks now. I LOVE it!  Very protective but not bulky. Perfect balance. The built-in screen protector is perfect. My only complaint... It doesn't come in purple.
"Minimal useful features - half of the apps on the watch are non functional, the radio feature doesn't work without the cheap and ill fitting earbuds, the touchscreen is either overly fiddly or unresponsive when using the on screen keyboard, etc. Surprisingly, I did put a sim card in it from our spare line, and that seems to work, but god help you trying to dial a number on the screen  keypad.<br /><br />The only thing that worked reliably was the notifications from my phone to the watch, but since it'll basically replicate EVERY notification of EVERY type by default, you then have to go into the poorly constructed host app on your phone and disable 99% of them. Oh, did I mention that you have to run a garbage coded scammy looking app and service in the background of the host phone, above and beyond the bluetooth connection, for any of this to &#34;work&#34;?<br /><br />Camera quality is poor. The remote shutter control thing is kinda neat (when it works), allowing you to use the watch to trigger the camera on your phone remotely.<br /><br />Almost no customization of the watch face, fonts, backgrounds, etc. The only saving grace is that it's as cheap as a lot of non smart watches, and it does seem to keep time."
lovely case... fits perfectly on my phone and am loving it
Got this for international travel and absolutely loved it! It's also a nice thing to have in emergency situations when the power goes out.
"Purshased one today, looking for a cheap but good looking phone just to see how those unlocked ones work. Pros: Price,  Big Screen, Kit Kat, Works on Tmobile H+ Nice, download speed of 6.4 mb average on the area purchased ,Puerto Rico,  it uploaded the Tmo network and Apn automaticly,  unboxing, it brings 3 screen protector (one already.placed), charger, earphones and a really cool fitted clear rubber case, everything nicely packed. For the price, 150$ total, it is a nice deal. CONS low ram, low memory 4gigs You can.use the external upgradable to 32 The phone says 8mb camera but it  sucks, pictures look so so, I checked the resolution and.it was at 8mp.maybe I'm just used to my Samsung camera. Still.haven't used the selfie one, so it must be awful too. It dont have an factory android.launcher like  touchwiz home instead brings an next launcher as default app, it look nice, but the icons are crappy, I downloaded the go.launcher and.resolved.it.until.I.can.get the original.kitkat launcher For the price, you just have to drop in an 32 g microsd and.you're.done!"
Do not buy..  Phone was advertised as unlocked.  Don't believe it!!!!!  Said I could contact Huawei to unlock bootloader. That's false too. Wish I could return and buy a phone with support. Stuck on 4.3 and No OTA in future yet Amazon is still selling this phone knowing some of your apps will never work cause the phone is no longer supported.
"This is a really nice looking case and right off the bat as soon as I took it out of the package, I loved it.<br /><br />This case also comes with a tempered glass screen protector, which is a nice bonus since most of the time I have had to purchase those separately whenever I have bought a case in the past. In addition, there is also a pair of cleansing and drying wipes included in the packaging so everything necessary to install the case comes right in the box.<br /><br />I found the case pretty simple to put on, and did not have any issues at all. Once I got the case on my phone, it was time to check everything out, and here is where I found the unfortunate flaw that caused me to rate the case with only 3 stars. All of the cutouts are the correct size and have the correct placement, EXCEPT for the charging port. Because of this, the phone cannot be charged while the case is on. Some people may be able to overlook this flaw, but for me, it is a deal breaker.<br /><br />The case itself is awesome and looks like it would offer a nice amount of protection, but I cannot see myself going through all of the trouble of having to remove the case completely every time that the phone needs to be charged. I received one to review, and this is my honest opinion. Hopefully, there will be an updated case soon with the issue corrected. Other than that design flaw, this would be a great case and I definitely would have used it regularly."
"For the price it has done a lot for me. Its been a year and a half and dropped in water within the first 2 months. Had to put it in rice but has been working ok after. Every once in a while there's a freeze on it, but otherwise I try not to download aps. I've put a virus scan on it though since I use the internet feature here and there. Volume seems like it could be louder than what it is for dual speaker."
Great case that holds a snug fit on s6+. Clear case to show off phones sexiness. 5 stars
We ordered these to use in our Boys & Girls Club.  We rent space in a large building and our rooms are spread out.  Parents come to the front desk and the front desk staff calls over the radio for the child(ren) being picked up.  2 out of 3 of these walkies stopped working within 2  month of buying them.  The warranty that I bought doesn't cover it because we use it in a work setting.  I ordered 3 more in July and 1 out of 3 of those isn't working.  Kids do not handle the walkies.  They sit on a desk by a staff.  I am VERY disappointed in the quality of these walkies for the HIGH price
BOUGHT THE FOR MY DAUGHTERS 14TH BIRTHDAY HUNDREDS CHEAPER THEN A BOSE AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY  I RECOMMEND IT!!
Ordered the case for my wife'said phone and she loves it ....very happy with this product....I will order again from your company. ....
"great cable, worked as described"
The case looks and feels really good. The only reason this isn't a five start review is because the kickstand feels a little cheap.
"Unfortunately, the battery wouldn't charge - it was DOA.  The shelf life must have expired.  Would like a replacement.  Thank you."
Works well.  Have put it through the paces and it's solid.
"Works well, small size and 2 x 2.4A ports to charge your devices at high speed. i received this product for free to test it and so far im loving it."
I use it a lot. It's light weight and easy to store.
"Yes, it did meet & exceed my expectations, so far I have been very impressed at the quality and appearance of the Piel Frama iPhone 6 plus case! I would recomment it to a friend!"
"As others have reviewed, this item is excellent quality.  I tried another similar arm band, giving me a benchmark - this one is WAY better, with a nicer feel, quality workmanship and nice features.  Since my 5'2&#34; and 110 lbs gives me puny arms, I had to cut off the second slot so I didn't have so much material on my arm. Now it feels comfortable.  Value can't be beat."
It didn't meet my expectations the screen protector popped out
Bought this for my son's phone which was suggested to me from a friend.  Fits great and will protect the phone which belongs to a 13-year old.
For the price its a bit too much they feel and look cheap... And to top it off they sent a different style than the ones you see in the picture... But they work right out of the box...
"The case has plenty of protection, and looks sleek. It slides out of pockets easily without pulling the fabric upwards. Since I put this case on about a month ago my phone has taken some serious tumbles and has come out unharmed.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the interior gray plastic flexible case is a little bit loose, especially around the bottom of the phone by the button. The thin strip of rubber there wiggles around a bit and there's a gap between the rubber and the plastic. I've just been kind of stuffing the rubbery part under the plastic and it's worked fine."
"I bought this for my son about 4 months ago. Verus reached out today, making sure that we liked the product and asking us to write a review. Although we haven't needed customer service, it appears they genuinely want to supply a great product. My son loves the case. He has used it every day for the past 4 months. It shows minimal wear. His only concern is that if he every lost the compartment cover, his case would look awful. Of course this has not happened. In fact, he says that the cover has not come off by accident a single time over the past 4 months. It look very nice and doesn't add much bulk to the phone, even with the secret compartment. I do not hesitate to recommend this case to anyone with an S6."
Great item.<br />Very sturdy feel to it.<br />Has charged IPhone S5 and Samsung S6 at the same time with out any problems.
"Works great, simultaneously charges a Google Nexus 4 and an ASUS tablet. On a personal note, I also like the blue light."
The case seemed to have been protective but I guess I droped it one to many times & not only did the case break my screen us also broken I would not recommend this product fir someone who always drops their phone or anything else for that matter
never got any parts to go with the gps what good is it with out parts
"One week after purchasing this case for my NEW phone, I left the phone on the top of my car and drove off!  Hours later my son received a call from my phone when it was found.  Not a SCRATCH on the case or phone!  Couldn't have asked for a better outcome!"
Case is fair. Had it three days and already it is fraying and losing it's color on edge that sits on table.
"Bought two of these and liked them initially.  The phone clamp worked well on my Samsung Avant w/ a thick protective case.  It held my phone securely horizontally and vertically.  The base stuck directly to the dash of my 06 4Runner and 05 Odyssey and was secure for about 3 days.  However, after a few days in the hot sun, the base lost suction and kept falling off.  I tried washing the suction cup and my dash per the instructions, but the base would only hold for a few hours.  Could never get it to stick like original again.  I'm guessing the hot sun baked the gooey-ness out of the suction cup."
Two things that I always need for my iPhone - a protective case and a charging cable. This case makes sure that I have both with me at all times. Pretty ingenious - the cable fits right in the case kickstand. Cool thing is that this cable is also quality - not just a cheap piece of *&#^. Highly recommended.
"I read several reviews before purchasing this case. This is everything i expected fits like a glove and was easy to put on phone, i don't think it took me 3 minute to put it on phone."
"I would say the guard dog iPhone case is average.  The silicone layer is easy to put on as well as  the outer case. I don’t particularly like the feel of the outer case...it is slick and the plastic outer case looks and feels rather cheap. If you want to add a little “oomph” to your case, it’s nice that you can have the hard outer layer as one color and the silicone inner liner as another.  Other companies offer cases which offer more substantial protection. .  but do you really need it?  It all depends upon your use and how “accident prone” you are. ;-)  For the current price, and for a “basic” case. . . This isn’t bad."
Works very well for Droid Maxx phone.  I like the &#34;kickstand&#34; part of case.  Get a alot of comments on that feature.
The order processed quickly and it was received quickly but I couldn't get it to work with my phone. I was able to hear when making a call but no one was able to hear me. I worked with it for a while before just determining that it just wouldn't work with my phone. Nice headset though!
Saves a lot of plug-in space on vacation!
"Awesome way to keep your cell phone safe while riding your bike!<br /><br />This is the only cell phone case for my bike which hasn't broke!! I bought two other types, and both of them broke after only a few weeks.<br /><br />This one uses rubber, and it absorbs the vibrations much better.  This thing is a MUST-HAVE if you ride your bike long distance, or it occasionally drizzles on your ride.  This will keep your phone remarkably dry during a rain, even though it's not 100% waterproof!<br /><br />Great buy!"
The slots inside for credit card was ripped and the outside is just plastic. Just kept it so I don't have to spend time returning
Not the most durable that's for sure.  The medal around it is thin and bends out of shape easily.
"Was purchased as a Christmas give. What a piece of junk...when it was opened on Christmas it looked great. When it was activated 2 days later, it showered why it was &#34;used&#34;. Junk is junk. Waisted my money on that one."
"Does not work, it makes my battery terribly hot & does not charge very well, plus, you cannot use your regular phone cases"
Difficult to clean. Great otherwise.
"I don't usually leave reviews but I have to say this is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CASE I'VE EVER BOUGHT! I much prefer to not have a case on my phone because they're either bulky and ugly or showy and don't protect. This case is slim AND gorgeous. I have no doubt it will protect my phone from nicks if I drop it. It's smooth but not slippery and the design is perfect. My only, Bengal complaint is that the outside lining tends to separate a bit from the inside design.. Maybe it's just the one I got... If they want to send me a free replacement I'd change it to 5 stars and be. A costumer for life! Haha."
"It states 10,000 mAH....... In all honesty it's more like 6,500-7,000 mAH.<br /><br />But still a good product for the price of $13.99.<br /><br />My main concern is how long this product might last. I hope it gives me at least 1 1/2 years of life. Only time will tell.<br /><br />My rating is as follows:<br />5 stars for the price<br />3 stars for the product<br /><br />Giving it an overall rating of 4 stars.<br /><br />If anything changes in the upcoming months I'll update my review."
Good case so far so good
Loved the watch until the back of it chipped where the battery charger connected. They cannot repair the crack except replace the whole watch and re-charge a cost that actually is more than what I paid originally.<br />Customer service was also non-existent so made the process worse.<br />Sad to say it was great for a few months.....
Nice case very tough I would recommend it
"Apparently they redid the installation process, so it was really easy to install.  Seems like a good product, but I guess I won't know for sure until I drop my phone."
This is my first portable charger. So far it's good.<br />Bought since the Anker products are great.
"Really solid, well built case.  Feels extremely well made provides a lot of protection for the device."
"The electronic equipment working only for 4 days, is of very poor quality. No recommend"
Love the fun pattern. The case has proven extremely sturdy considering the abuse it has received from my young children getting a hold of my phone.
"Love this case, super girly just like me!!  Great customer service from KoKo cases with amazing shipping time. Great company, will definitely purchase from KoKo again!  Thanks!!"
"It does get switched off sometimes, but overall a good product"
Super cute case just lost a few stones after a few months of use. not bad as I am hard on phones.
"Loved the item and got a plethora of compliments on it. Only issue is that it did not last; after about 2-3 drops the case started to crack and break. Which gave me a sad face cause I loved the case and style. I had to go back to the Duro case I bought 2 years ago which I have dropped more time than I can count and it's still trucking! However, if you want compliments and love retro Nintendo, this is a great case; just be sure to take care of it and not drop it."
This is a perfect replacement for my camera lens on the iPhone 9. I got the silver and the color matches perfectly. The lens cover is well made and and is a perfect replacement. The glass is very clear and once installed you can not even tell it was not the one that came on the iPhone 6.<br /><br />So people know this takes a little work that most people may not want to do themselves. You will need to remove the back cover of the phone which is not that easy to do and it can break really easy. Watch this video before you attempt to replace the lens cover on you iPhone 6:<br />[...]. It can be done but takes some time and a lot of patience. I was able to replace mine but it took me about 30 minutes.
This is a great case if you only want to use it for a few months. beautiful design and the ability to put cards in it is awesome. Then the blaring problem comes into view. the case does not last. the tab to hold the case broke of multiple crack lines throughout the outside cover. the only part that has lasted is the inner rubber piece that holds the phone. The only thing that holds that rubber piece in is some sticky type substance and when it pulls dirt and other stuff get onto the stickiness and causes the rubber piece to never stick to that section again. the outside cover was in such bad shape that I just ended up ripping the outside off and just using the inside rubber piece to protect my phone. In total if you looking for a temporary case this is great for you but if you want one to one look somewhere else this is not the case for you.
I've been having problems with people understanding me ever since I put the cover on.  Don't think it's an efficient case for the microphone.
I cannot get my Bluetooth to pair with my phone. I have called Sony tech support and they do not deal with Sony Ericsson products anymore. The radio works fine.
Nice case
"This worked great for about 2 weeks and then out of the blue it just stopped charging altogether.  Very disappointed as I was<br />so happy to have found a long cord, it's a shame it wasn't reliable or sturdy to last longer than days.  I will be returning this item."
Prongs broke on day three so won't charge phone
"This is a great tempered glass screeen.  Installation is straight forward and simple if followed correctly.  I have had no issue with it shipping or cracking and it looks and feels like there is nothing covering my screen.  I highly recommend for anyone with a OnePlus One to get this glass protector, you wont be disappointed."
"Great gadget to have. I was able to take pictures of 4 of us, husband and 2 kids all together. I usually the one missing in action, the &#34;photographer&#34;. All the pictures of vacations and fun times as a family, it was always my hubby and kids. Now I can join in. it folds small and fits in my purse, backpack. Sturdy and great quality for the price."
Kept falling out of my phone and running down my battery. Even with it in my phone thought the s pen was detached
"I'm using this remote to control a DNX572BH (2015 Kenwood lineup).  Functionality is incredibly lacking compared to an older KVT719DVD (2007 Kenwood lineup) unit and remote that I have.  With my old unit and remote I can press 1 on the remote and it will take me to my radio preset number 1.  The new one, nope...On my old unit, while playing MP3, bluetooth, or any other media type, I can press next on the remote and it will move forward to the next track; my new one?  Nope.  All I can do with this remote is change the volume and scroll through radio stations. Apparently technology has regressed since 2007.  I am pissed off that I bought this remote and I'm wondering what the difference is between this remote that has been discontinued and the much pricier remote with the same model # that is still active."
"I live in Venezuela, the phone works well with movistar and movillnet. I am very pleased with my purchase, easy to use and supports all applications I have installed. Really great and the best value."
"perfect fit for my android phone,great price.Fits security of my belt .Easy to get out of case and snap back in,like it a lot.I have seen people bend over and their smart phones fall from their shirt pocket,hit the floor ,not a good thing.With this case you will not have that problem.Also does not scratch screen."
"The tracking is great, app is great. It actually does track sleep and recognizes when you are active. The problem is the design is poor. I have had my up since June and lost it at least once a week. The first week I lost it at work. As a nurse I naturally went through all the dirty linen (yep!) on our unit and found it! After thorough sanitation it was back in my wrist where it belonged. Naturally I blamed myself, maybe I didn't have it fitted properly. Nope.  Ya'll this thing falls off all the time. I have found it between my car seats, in my dogs bed, in the bathtub, in my bed, in my pool.... The list goes on.  Well, until yesterday that is. It is most definitely nowhere to be found. So bottom line, you pay that much it needs to be secure. It works great, when you know where it is."
"I've used this panel quite a bit now, charging several different devices in several different conditions, and I'm very impressed, for the most part, with its performance. Measuring power output with an in-line USB multimeter showed I was able to squeeze between 8 & 9 watts from it in full sunlight. That's pretty close to its theoretical maximum output of 10 watts from one USB port, (The panel may be rated up to 14 watts, but 10 watts (2 amps x 5 volts) is the most you could possibly get from a single USB port.) and quite comparable to the 2 amp USB wall charger I used as a control. In short, this panel will charge your device just about as fast as most wall chargers--in direct sunlight.<br /><br />Every solar panel's Achilles heel has always been a precipitous drop in power output in cloudy conditions, and the Anker panel is no different. It uses mono-crystalline solar cells, which historically perform better than polycrystalline cells in cloudy conditions. Still, I notice that the power output would often drop to 2 watts or below in anything less than direct sunlight. In stormy conditions, output would drop into the milliwatt range, 250 mw or below. This is still enough juice to trickle-charge most devices, but it will definitely extend the charge time of more power-hungry devices by a matter of several hours. This problem is certainly not unique to the Anker panel, though. Just be aware that, in cloudy weather, you likely won't be charging any large, power-hungry tablets with it.<br /><br />Build quality is very good, from what I could tell. The panels are surrounded in a pretty tough-feeling canvas fabric & held shut by a thick strip of velcro. It has four metal O-rings on Its perimeter, and the USB connections are shrouded inside a pocket which also serves as a convenient place to store your device. The USB ports themselves seem kind of flimsy & loose though, and they don't include a cover to keep debris out when they're not in use. I'd highly recommend keepingthis thing off the ground as much as possible. It's a bit bulky and heavy for the ultra-light backpacking crowd, but then again, I could see this thing easily recharging digital cameras, walkie-talkies, GPS units, smart phones, head lamps and the like, and saving a ton of batteries in the process.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have about this panel is that the box which houses the DC-DC converter and the USB ports gets really hot while in use. This isn't just due to solar heating, as the rest of the panel doesn't get nearly as hot, even after spending several hours in direct sunlight. This has me a little concerned about the longevity of the panel's DC-DC converter. Here's hoping Anker did their homework & designed it to hack high temperatures for hours at a time.<br /><br />One last note: I bought this panel along with Anker's own 16000 mAh Li-Ion battery. [[ASIN:B00N2T7U90 Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh Portable Charger  External Battery Power Bank with PowerIQ Technology 2-Port 3A for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Air, mini, Galaxy S6 S5 S4 S3, Note 4 3 2, Tab 4 3 2 Pro, Nexus 4 5 7 10, HTC One, One 2 (M8), LG G3, MOTO X G, most other Phones and Tablets (Black).]]<br />I found that this battery will stop charging when its input current drops below a set point, and it won't resume charging until it has been physically disconnected and reconnected to its power source. Anker's customer support has confirmed this to be an issue with this specific battery. At this time, I'd recommend going with a different battery, as this one is essentially incompatible with any kind of solar charging, due to this flaw."
"I purchased this to replace a one year old S4 case.  I figure a year is pretty good based on my phone usage.  I received this case and attempted to carefully install it.  After several attempts to fit the rigid outer shell over the flexible inner liner, it broke unexpectedly at the volume control / edge of screen location.  The flexible inner liner is slightly too small to fit well and the outer liner is brittle compared to the Spigen case I was replacing."
It was OK from a price point there's nothing that can compare. The battery is pretty great and has useful specs. I did have some trouble with att network.<br /><br />UPDATE: after 2 1/2 months the earpiece stopped working.
"Received the order, installed on watch and it would not close correctly unable to close one of the clips. Lost the cover, threw away"
Using it to hold my iPhone 6 with silicone casing on a BMW R Nine T handlebar.<br />Easy to mount and versatile when it comes to orientation: can use the iPhone as GPS or action cam both in portrait and landscape modes. Easy to set even with riding gloves.<br />Holds iPhone 6 perfectly up to legal speeds including on highways.
"Well... i was very excited to get my case and once i got it out of the box i was disappointed that it wasnt the same color as the picture shows. The picture is a lighter black, more like a gray color and the purple is brighter. Well my case is dark black and dark purple... also my stylus is black not purple like the picture. Im hoping its because im in a dark room. I like how the buttons are easy to push and i like how it fits my phone. For the most part it seems to be like my old otterbox, maybe a little cheaper made but as of now it works fine. Also the kickstand is really hard to open."
I like this case a lot.  I had the Defender's case but it was too bulky.  This is much easier to carry around.  Thank you.
I bought Two of the TUDIA Ultra Slim Full Matte Cases a Black & a Blue the Blue is tuff Looking But if You have a Screen Protector it will push agents it and make bubble on the edges they are  Great Cases well made.
This case is a fake.  And a VERY poor one at that.
Had this cable for 9 months and it gave me an error message.  Spoke to the seller and they we awesome and are issuing a replacement cable.  I have a few of these and am overall very happy with the product and especially appreciate their customer service follow through.
"I followed the directions precisely. Cleaned the case with the alcohol pad provided and let it dry thoroughly. Peeled the liner from the adhesive and pressed the adapter to the case and held it with constant pressure for 30 seconds, flipped it over and held it for another 30 seconds, then let it dry for more than 24 hours before using. Then the first time I used the belt clip the adhesive let loose and my phone went clattering to the floor. I called lifeproof and they are going to send me a replacement adapter. If the first adhesive didn't hold then why should I trust the replacement?"
"Case is amazing.  Needed a case quickly as the iPhone was already dropped and need glass replaced, very happy with look and feel of the case.  Item was shipped and in perfect condition.  will most likely look for more items from this seller :)"
excellent product.  much more durable than the rubber/plastic units.
"Very durable on the outside, inside vinyl works fine!  Great value for the price!"
"This is a very good GPS unit, however it had some navigation issues and caused me headaches in places that had a lot of traffic so I have to give it 2 stars.<br /><br />The GPS took a very, very long time to download the initial update, it was not 8 hours, but it was at least 3-4 hours. You also have to connect it to a computer, it cannot download the updates over wifi. I did not have any trouble with this process at all.<br /><br />Some states you cannot attach this unit or anything to your windshield,, since the device comes with a windshield mount, so you have to be careful if you are driving through a state with this restriction as I am sure it would be an instant ticket from the police.<br /><br />The highway navigation on this GPS unit is very good, it is very precise, and plenty of time is given to make a lane change. This I definitely a feature I appreciate.<br /><br />If you are trying to find anything off a highway then the GPS would excel at this, if your destination is just off a highway or relatively close to one. I took a trip to an area that I do not know too well with the plan on relying on this GPS to get me around safely. Since there is a lot of traffic in this area (and just about every other area that is a major city in the USA) it fails at navigating safely through high traffic residential and commercial neighborhoods. I would expect that a GPS unit would be able to navigate me correctly and safely wherever I go in the USA, but this one kind of fails at that.<br /><br />It does not tell you whether to go right or left out of a parking lot to get to your next destination. If you are shopping or going to an amusement park you have to guess whether you need to go right or left out of the parking lot to get to your next destination.<br /><br />Instead of telling me to go left out of a parking lot of a shopping plaza instead it told me to make a U-turn around a busy intersection, this caused me to get stuck in a snafu of traffic and cause a holdup because the GPS was not working right and it almost got me killed! I am not even sure if it was a legal turn, that could have lead to even more problems. It also sent me in circles down streets that I did not need to go down. Instead it could have just told me to turn left out of the parking lot and I would have reached my next stop much faster without causing a traffic holdup or snafu.<br /><br />It also tried to tell me to make a right turn down a street that clearly was not a street that you could make a right turn on, since there was no possible way to make a right turn on this street. Again, another traffic snafu, if it would have just told me to go down a different street or just to go straight this would not have been a problem.<br /><br />It does show street names and locations which is extremely helpful, the spoken voice is not a problem to understand at all. Showing the street names and location is helpful because sometimes signs are torn down or are unreadable, its also helpful to show the exact location of each street, so you know, in 3 intersections you have to turn here. This prevents going down the wrong street. This is a great feature and its very, very accurate.<br /><br />If you are looking for a museum or amusement park or some place where the entrance may not be too obvious then this GPS might not do that well with it, we missed the entrance to a museum because we didn't really know where it was, and it was not clearly labeled in an easy to find way. It wasn't too bad because we were able to turn around and go back in. The GPS just tells you &#34;arriving at x location&#34; it doesn't show you exactly where the entrance is.<br /><br />I also had to navigate several roundabouts to get to one of my destinations, and this GPS did surprisingly well with this, then again I was in a slightly more rural area and there wasn't a lot of traffic around. But it outlined exactly where to go on the maps so I did not make a wrong turn, without the GPS doing that,I do not think I would have made it to my destination without several wrong turns as the roundabouts were very confusing, and there was at least 5-6 of them.I do not think I would have made it to my destination without several wrong turns as the roundabouts were very confusing, and there was at least 5-6 of them."
case is slightly to small hard to get phone in and out. i've only had this about a month and the case is already ripping. not very happy
"I am impressed with the sound coming from this pair of Rio S earbuds:  Very nicely balanced; rich, yet lively sound; full and all-around sound like you are sitting right there in the same room as the performance.  Not an iota of sibilance to be heard.<br /><br />The longer you listen, the better they sound.  So give them their opportunity to break in.  Easy to listen to for hours, too--they are very comfortable.  For a budding audiophile, you absolutely cannot go wrong with these.<br /><br />The sound engineers have given the bass plenty of room to work its magic.  And vocals are very lifelike.  I hear much depth with solo singers, both male and female.  I hear that tiny touch of tinniness that I'm used to with a few of my favorite rock band vocals.<br /><br />Instruments sound really great:  Strings, guitar, reeds, accordion.  Horns are really wonderful.  Piano even more wonderful.<br /><br />Mic feature works fine.<br /><br />Comes with three sets of different sized ear tips, so you can get the perfect fit.  Fit is very important to your listening experience:  Don't be afraid to mix sizes.  Personally I need one large and one medium.  It would have been nice to see a set of Comply ear tips in this package.  If you are comparing this set to others in this price range, you will find some with an extra pair of Comply tips enclosed.  It is a plus.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the flat cable has a little too much memory and I can never get it to lose its waves.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Noontec."
Has about a 6 inch range. Useless.
"looks like an iphone otterbox, but doesn't fit at all.  we had to tweek it to get it to fit. wouldn't buy it again."
This is a great speaker! Bought it for the golf course and it works perfect. Good sound from this tiny speaker! I have already recommended it to several other people!
Excellent case for my ipad mini. Awesome design and protection.
"I like my new case from #Ghostek it is pretty💣since Lifeproof wanna bullcrap on making a Fr&egrave; for the 6 plus. I'm not fond of their Nu&uacute;d case but I am VERY fond of this Ghostek case, I submerged this case in water and there was NO WATER AT ALL inside of it!! I got this case and am very glad that I made the purchase while getting qualified for the Amazon.com Chase credit card with $1,000 credit limit & $200 cash advance didn't hurt neither😉fyi: I have a GLASS HD screen protector by Amzer on underneath the plastic screen protector that is on the case & my phone works fine with NO problems at all. It's very CLEAR while viewing & still easy to use the touchscreen. I wish that the case would have come EXACTLY as advertised with only 2 holes in the front but it has 3 & the extra hole at the top isn't needed because the phone only has 2 holes in the front on the screen. That's my only issue with it so that's why I gave it 4⭐️instead of 5 because the picture is false advertising in my eyes because I expected to have the EXACT same front for my screen. I called my son and he said I sounded muffled a little bit but it's barely noticeable so we switched phones and I didn't hear anything, maybe I need a hearing aid, so I'll just wait until someone else calls me and tells me I sound weird or something to comeback and do an update for that part of the phone. I like how my phone is completely covered it is not a piece of my phone uncovered and I like that ALOT!! It's like my Zero Lemon case but waterproof with a plastic screen protector on top of my Amzer tempered glass screen protector. #Ghostek #Apple #iPhone6Plus"
I got these to try out this technology.  They were well worth the cost and I think they will hold up well.
"Great product, awesome price, fits lots of cards, license insurance etc plus you could throw some paper money in there also."
"Updating my review.  Worked great but this one is not very durable. After a month of actual use, the end of the cable broke and got stuck in the phone.  Be aware of the warranty, tudia wants you to pay $5 to replace.  The cheaper cables last longer than these.  Will not buy this brand again."
"I've had this case for over a year and its been on and off my phone several times. I only have one little crack on the pink border in the front. Easy to get on and off but very sturdy. I know if I drop my phone, I'm not going to have a cracked screen."
"Love this little guy.... this is the second one I bought.  We used it to death.  Actually my 4 year old bent the first one too far.  We love this product.  Many positions, does not tip easily.  I bought 2 more.  Everyone in the family is always looking for the ipad stand."
works perfect
Have to use a cleaner to clean the glass.  Too small for the Galaxy's screen.  Leaves a gap between it and the Otterbox case I have!
This phone wasn't Android 5 and is NOT 4glte on At&t networks .. other than that is a great phone for the money
Love it!! Use it all the time!
"This product we received was NOT the product in the description. It was similar- but not enough for us to like it. The description states &#34; A locking swivel belt clip is easily locked into an extended position and provides different viewing angles while watching movies or video calls, also rotatable 180 degrees&#34; - however this was not possible with the case shipped to us. The silicone shell showed honeycomb grip interior in product photos, which was not what we received. The silicone shell also did not fit snug around the phone and was loose enough to look like it was not the right model for the phone - an HTC Desire 626s - which is stated in product description to be made to fit both 626 and 626s. All the buttons and cutouts for camera, mic, earbuds and charging were correct, and so was the outer shell and the front cover/holster fit nice and snug over the outer shell. Also in the photos it shows that the front cover / belt clip holster interior is covered in either felt or some other material to possibly help protect the phone screen. The product that we received was just the hard plastic interior. The item we received was ok - but we did not like how loose the inner silicone case looked on the phone (it appeared wrinkled around the edges when the outer case was applied) and were concerned it would slip off too easily and not provide the protection we desired. When the phone was inside the belt clip front cover/holster it did not feel like it would slip out but as the phone will be in the hands of a teen more than in its belt holster, this was a concern as well as the odd look it gave to the phone with the wavy/wrinkled look down the sides from the silicone not being a proper fit. We will be returning this product immediately and looking for something else."
"My family and I really love the product. It is really great feature with 360 rotation, I can move my cell to every angle.<br />What a brilliant idea!"
"Installation was very easy, I just followed the instructions it came with and went on flawlessly. Would buy again if this one breaks or I get a new phone."
"Perfect, I needed this for my car, everyone wants to charge their phone while driving, this out let made it possible."
"I bought this after realizing my Ringke SLIM case was not protecting my screen entirely when my phone was inverted. It grips easily, doesn't have much visible branding, and it doesn't block any of the buttons, sensors, camera, or speaker functions. Highly recommend."
Great case. Looks nice on the phone and the look makes it look like there is no case on it. I primarily only by Spigen cases and this is the reason why. On my iPhone I also use a Spigen thin case.
"Works very well for the intended use, i was actually a little surprised by the good quality of the sound, it's of course not a bose-like sound but it's pretty decent for a wireless headset. battery duration is very good, and overall no complains. I personally feel a little discomfort after wearing them for +45 minutes (at gym) since you really have to push them well inside your ears so that they stay in place. also the master and volume buttons are extremely difficult to use, i actually don't used them at all while wearing them (it's very hard to push), but i have no issues controlling everything from my phone."
"HAD TO CUT IT TO MAKE IT FIT I PAD AIR AND COMES OFF WHEN I PUT CHILDPROOF CASE ON IT,BUT CANT BEAT THE PRICE"
"Love this case on my Samsung Note 4, and even my 15 month old grand baby has not hurt the phone as many times as she has dropped it. Does exactly what it says, protects your phone."
"Activated the phone with AT&T and it works great. I receive high signal strength almost everywhere I go at work and home. Not a top of the line phone but for the price and everything it comes with, very well worth it."
"Item came with no instructions within box. Item is as described, great sound and over all satisfied with purchase."
Really good head unit.  Sounds awesome and gives out plenty of power for my 7 speaker audio system in my car. Only problem I can think of is the option to save names of songs you hear on the radio is only for iPhone users and also I can't get my unit to dis play the name for radio at all via an analog connection.
"This is an updated review of these earbuds.  After about a month of using them once a week for about 2 hours each use, they keep disconnecting/reconnecting to my iPhone while I'm listening to music.  It happens frequently enough that it may do it once, twice or even three times during a single song.  The earbuds are fully charged while this is happening and the iPhone is in my pocket.  It has gotten so bad that I'm going to request either a replacement or refund."
"Seems abit cheap, hard plastic, tight fit. But it does what it was made for, is handy and certainly protects your phone."
I always used garmin nuvi and when it broke I bought this Tom tom. The maps appear really old style looking. Hard to terminate routes.
"Product was received for free in exchange of honest opinion. this is one of the most fancy car mounts I have had. it has a nice and specific shape and holds perfectly any type of device, smartphones as well. It is heavy and the package was really good. This product offers a lot of stability and protection for your phone while used in the car. I really like it."
Do  not  waste  your  time!!!!!!
"great phone. I bought it for easier messaging and a phone.  It has features I'll never use, some I may use. The only thing that I'd like is a front facing camera so I can Skype!"
I love my new case! It's perfect! Love the Pink!!!
The highlight of this delivery was the fact that it arrived in one day.  I was disappointed to receive a blue cover when I asked for black and the back cover had the corner peeled back already.
"Love these cords!  But they need to make the plug in more narrow. Have to take phone out of its Otter Box to charge with this cord. That's why I only gave 4 stars. It is a very good, sturdy, and thick cord. That's what I love about this. I love the 10 ft length also."
"I like the case design, but it has a few flaws.  I guess for the money it is worth it.  But several of the plugs don't stay in so I ended up just cutting them off instead of sending it back for a replacement."
works as advertised both vertically and horizontally.  Does not have the rotating plastic clip which I have &#34;snapped off&#34; of previous  several cases.<br />holsters galaxy note 4 in otterbox  defender case.
I bought this to use with my paddle board on the lakes and rivers.  It works great. Works perfectly with my iPhone 6. I use to take pictures which come out awesome and can still listen to my music.  (No headphones). Has a little leash which is nice so I don't drop my phone in the water.
We use them as cat toys because they bounce around and the cat loves them.
Great product.  No problems putting together.  Soft rubber.  Works really well to protect device.
Great!
"A little slick on the hard plastic back, but very good case overall."
I've purchase 1 in every color since trying out my first one. The material feels the same & the bands act the same as my Apple sport bands. They are perfect!
"I like this charger alot! I have no problem charging my iphone or ipads, works great and fast. Love all the ports."
These are the best moderately priced headphones I could find that had android volume controls.
"The worst!  I did a good bit of research before buying but it did not help.  The phone froze, turn off, or turn into a black screen and locked. I finally returned it to factory condition and am trying to sell it.  I needed Motorola's help to return it to factory condition because it was locked. I did not lock it.  Motorola said it locked itself because it thought an unidentified user was trying to use it.  What a waste of time.  Stay away and save your money."
"Fits the Note 3, not Note 4. Very dissatisfied. Forced it onto my phone and the pressure on the side buttons had the phone constantly restarting itself."
Great case. Extremely thin and my beautiful phone is still visible.
"This little speaker is great,very load for a small speaker with decent sound and charge lasts a long time,I'm very pleased with this speaker considering the price."
This case is awesome. I love it. The quality is great and the look is very sleek. Definitely worth it!
"Wow, you will not find better Bluetooth headphones for under $25. They sound great, come with all the accessories that allow you to customize them to fit your ears perfectly. I really like the voice prompts, you know for sure if they are turned off."
"Product was not as described, further more the wrong one was sent, I would not recommend buying this product."
"Solid product, however, the clear film protectant wasn't that easy to put on. You cannot charge the device without taking off the Gray Case Holder so it is a little inconvenience. But the product functions well"
Works so good just ordered one for my desk . One thing tho you do need a 2 amp charger. it comes with a usb wire but no charger.
"Fits well and looks like it will give good protection.  I like the feel in my hand - a problem with some cases.  It does add a little bulk, but that's to be expected for a case of this style.  The cut-outs are perfectly placed and it's easy to use the side buttons."
"Mounted it to my CD slot in my '98 Buick Regal in a few seconds, and it covers my clock display only a little.  I put both magnets in between my Otterbox Commuter case and my iPhone 6 Plus (fits perfectly, can't even tell the magnets are there) and my phone is very secure on the mount.  Only time it fell was because I had not matched up the mount magnet well at all with the phone magnets when I set the phone on the mount, and even then it still held my phone well until I hit a severe bump.  This mount in combination with the JETech FM transmitter is a godsend, the latter especially for older cars.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Ridiculously fast and easy installation<br />*Can rotate the phone to landscape without taking the phone off the mount.<br />*Holds my honking big iPhone 6 Plus with Otterbox Commuter case VERY securely (most important factor for me).<br />*SAFETY = improves attention to road (Don't have to fumble for phone, have it sliding around loose, falling, or sitting in your lap).<br />*Can see GPS navigation on the phone, switch songs, watch videos/movies, control phone calls, use earbuds with built-in mic.<br />*Can more easily hear if you get a call, txt, email, etc. especially when listening to music.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Blocks my clock display a little<br /><br />**TLDR: Works PERFECTLY with an iPhone 6 Plus and an Otterbox Commuter case using both included magnets. Fantastic for controlling music, calls, videos and GPS from your phone while enhancing safety."
Fast shipping & great price<br />It's doing a great job protecting my iPod & my brother and sister haven't complain about it either :)
"Compact, simple and effective. Rarely did I have trouble with people understanding me."
"Excellent seller,  item meets the specifications"
The screen protector was pretty good on my note 5. I wish it covered a little more on the width but with a case the fitting was perfect. However my first shipment of this product came with a slight blemish but amazon sent me a replacement right away. Overall a good product for the price.
It was not what I expected and I would love my money back if i could get it. It did not come with the materials I thought it would.
Great case
The only issue I had was it seemed like the magnet for the closure was wearing out.  Maybe I just use my phone too much. :)
"Great case, except I made the mistake of ordering one for an iPhone 6 instead of an iPhone 6 plus. All around a great case. Replaced my order for the correct case just now :)"
Very happy with order. Came a few days earlier than when Amazon told me it will be deliver. Very happy customer.
"Very satisfed with the sound quality, and the pairing was totally painless.  This is a great product and I highly recommend this product to others."
"[[ASIN:B00U0JVW7G SaharaCase iPhone 6 Case - Rugged Protection, Thin and Lightweight, Includes Tempered Glass Screen Protector, Professional Camera Hood, Stunning Colors Including Black and Gray Sahara Case]]I  the case is one that wont slip out of your hand and it protect good too.also have to say that the temper glass that you sent with that is probably one of the best ones that I have had for not leaving fingerprints very bad and it wipes off very easy"
"Cute case, however it did not fit my phone properly. Material was also a little on the thin side."
"Its a good workout bra. It says that it doesnt dig into your skin but worn underneath a kevlar vest, it does. Definitely not one to wear for a 13 hr shift."
Yes I like this.  Works on surfaces and case type material you wouldn't expect.
Price is way to high
These work.  Fit is fine.  My three kids used one to plug three headphones into one iPod shuffle on a recent car trip.    update: July 2016 they still work fine.  No change.
"I recently bought a new iPhone 6Plus with a Lifeproof Nuud case, based on the recommendation of the Verizon Saleswoman. The LIFEPROOF was a complete & expensive waste of $$MONEY$$. No one could understand what I was saying - they said I sounded like I was underwater.  THEN I ordered WILDTEC as a replacement. WOW, compared to the $110 Nuud, WILDTECK was a steal! Easy to install AND more importantly everyone can understand what I'm saying now! ONLY one small concern, the APPLE Lightning charging cable, is a very, very tight fit thru the case port. IF you don't mind trimming or shaving aftermarket cable connectors in order to fit, this IS the case for you! I am a happy customer!!!!! Thanks Wildtek...."
"Seeing how there aren't very many waterproof cases out for the note 4, I decided to give this one a shot. First off, I chose this product cause it looked better than the other options available on the market.  Out of the box: it's a nice looking case with decent cut outs (could've made the boarders less thick to allow edge-to-edge accessibility, but there's another draw back to this that's pointed out later on), foam and rubber parts were nice, back kick  stand is a little tough to get out but is a very nice addition, the rubber notification cut out was a definite plus for me.  Testing: alright, so taking apart the case is slightly rough but the snapping when you close it is oh so satisfying. The water test went fine; put a piece of paper in the case, sealed it off, submerged it under water for an hour, shook off the water, opened it up and the paper was still dry. The bubbles that come out of the bottom speaker vent is normal. Had no issues with watching videos and audio being muzzled. Only my OEM charger would fit, which they state somewhere in the papers along with screen protector usage being ill advised when paired with this case (found this to be true).  Conclusion and why I'm giving it a two star rating: it was a great product when I used it for all of a week but decided to take it off and the corner of the front panel, above the s pen door, broke. On that note, the mechanism that opens for the s pen access is EXTREMELY weak and a little pressure on it will open it. As I need to constantly open the case to swap out the battery for a fresh one, this may have considerably weakened the case, but this shouldn't be to the point where a corner cracks open due to it. I wanted to like the case, but you really get what you pay for and it's not the best long term product to go with."
"I have to say I'm very impressed with this case.  It's definitely on the thin side (but not the thinnest), yet I think provides sufficient protection.  I ordered 3 different cases based on reviews (all very good) and this one is one of the top two.  Probably the top if you want to combine protection, yet being thin.  When I received it, I actually though they sent the wrong one.  (It looked like one piece).  It was just slightly challenging to get on, but as one reviewer stated, I started at the top and worked my way down.  I can't decide if the little cover on the power slot will be annoying or if it's a great idea to keep out pocket lint.  At least you have the option of cutting it off.  For the price, the protection and reasonable thin-ness of this case, I would definitely recommend."
Worked perfectly for our backpacking trip. I live in southern AZ so I have not tried it in part sun.
"The Docking Cradle works fine. But this was not my problem. I have to replace the antenna, the cable connection is bad. I keep loosen the signal."
"Perfect fit.  Took me all of about 5 minutes, maybe even less, to install.  I have no idea how my son managed to break the original."
On the outside of the wallet I was expecting it to say crown like it shows in the picture. Crown was misspelled to cronw so I did not enjoy this product at all.
"Product shipped quickly. Nice looking case however like several other reviews mentioned, it does not fit snugly on the sides. Not sure if some fit and some don't but it was really annoying to have it fit so loosely."
"Great, durable product. Fast delivery."
Pretty case. But the inner piece that actually holds the phone starting breaking apart piece by piece after a couple of months.
Pros:<br />Received item quickly<br />Colors match pictures<br />Magnet seems strong<br />Phone fits perfectly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Smidge of blue color on the green flap (see pic)<br /><br />Other than that I'm happy!
Great product and fairly simple to put together. Looks good but be ready to purchase another cable since its pretty much there once you set it up! Highly recommended if ill end up being a charging station in your desk or something!
The remote works fine but the trunk opening button doesn't work on my model car. Oh well
"Cute & fun, easy to match with"
"This case is pretty good and does its job well. The only problem I have with it is that it is a gold color, and not the bright yellow that it is pictured to be on Amazon. I wish that the correct color could have been shown in Amazon when I was looking to purchase it. Update on October 20, 2015- I wanted a red case for my Galaxy J1, to keep in mind God's wonderful gift of salvation to us, through &#34;the blood of Jesus Christ his Son (that) cleanseth us from all sin.&#34; 1 John 1:7, KJV. I checked out several red cases for the Samsung Galaxy J1, but this was the one I could afford. I went with what I knew, even though the gold one I had at first ordered from Bemz was not as bright yellow as I would have liked, as previously mentioned. But on this case, Bemz came through with FLYING COLORS! This case matches the bright color shown on Amazon, and is not a darker red, as I feared it would be! Good job, Bemz!!!  So now I give Bemz a five-star review!!"
"Excellent product. As advertised. Patience is key however. Especially when removing the old cracked screen. I practiced on my old broken S3, so I could understand process better. Luckily I did since I overheated old phone LCD with heat gun. Using tape on cracked screen face was a HUGE help to prevent wire from getting hung up on broken glass pieces. Be sure to watch the youtube video before or during replacement."
Works great because I have the phone e in a case.  A magnate system wouldn't work  Very easy to use. .
This case fits my sons moto G perfectly. The cutouts are lined up exactly with all of the ports unbutton and the raised edges around the screen help to protect that from getting scratched or cracked. Kids are so hard on their phones and it's nice to know so with this case I'm getting enough protection that I won't have to be buying a brand new phone here in just a few more months. It's inevitable that it's going to be dropped and that's why I knew I had to get a case with good protection. I have another case by this brand that I personally use on my LG g4 and it's fantastic.  I love their prices and the peace of mind I get knowing my phone id's safe. The cases are lightweight and do not add all kinds of crazy bulk to the designs of our phones yet still manage to offer great protection from accidental drops and bang ups. I am extremely impressed and pleased with the performance of these phone cases and would not hesitate to buy other cases from them. I did receive this case free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes however my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion of this brand and their case.
Shipment did not have  ansy initial instructions with it..
"This selfie stick is relatively easy to use. It's adjustable, so that's an added bonus and I like the box it came in. The packaging is gifty which is a huge plus for me."
Great.
No complaints. Seems pretty good so far. Basically getting 2 for less than the price of one from apple.
"I bought this unit and it looks great for my 2008 Honda Accord.  I installed it myself, also install a back up camera. The compliments I get on the new unit is great. I would really recommend this to anybody that's looking to upgrade.  Bluetooth for the phone  another great feature. All my steering wheel controls still work."
This is the 2nd of this style dash mount. Works best for us and our vehicles. Minnesota State law does not allow us to attach items such as gps or radar detectors to the windshield directly (VERY STUPID LAW). This makes the unit secure and we are able to lower it to the floor to help hide it so our car is less likely to be broken into.
"If you are accustomed to an Otter Box like enclosure, this case is very similar in feel / style. Thee 8500mAH battery cannot be beat! If you need the longest lasting battery and don't mind the admittedly larger case, this product is for you.<br /><br />My only dislike is the implementation of the belt clip. The case is excellent, feels good in your hand. I think the phone is easier to hold and use the virtual keyboard. I wish the belt clip was a little better. It's secure, but nearly impossible to insert/remove with one hand. Perhaps it will loosen up with time. That's a small complaint for a case/battery combination that will give you unmatched runtime between charges and excellent protection of the phone."
The item arrived sooner than I expected. The only issue is the mic pickup is seemingly weak as people have reported they have difficulty hearing me during conversations. 1/3 the price of the LG model.
Beautiful case that showcases my iPhone 6 very well. I thought it would be harder to get it on because of previous reviews but it really wasn't that bad. The video attached to the case wasn't very helpful though. It was for a different supcase. Great product!
Does not work with the iPhone 6. It says the accessory is not supported. Useless
"Great case, would highly recommend if you want to streamline and not take away from your already well designed iPhone"
"Protective and slim case, easy to grip and buttons are accessible."
It's okay.  Definitely on the cheap side.  But you get what you pay for.
"Only reason that I couldn't rate it lower is because there isn't any option for fractional stars. The battery is junk, was worse than the last junk batter that I got sold. It is from 2013, so I presume its repackaged junk?<br /><br />It also had identifying information &#34;redacted&#34; with a metallic paint pen."
Nice speaker crisp sound with no distortion. Bought for kayak trips since its water proof but have not been due to inclement weather but I'm sure it will be awesome once out there
"Go-to, inexpensive mp3 player for my workouts. I'm on my 3rd one (have been wearing them out for about 8 years). The clips eventually break or the headphone jack gets messed up (causing the sound goes out in one ear), but I'm talking after a couple of years of very heavy use/abuse.<br />---PROS:<br />-Inexpensive<br />-Clips onto clothes for hands-free use<br />-Comes with COBY earbuds (I have trouble using any other kind due to an inner ear piercing)<br />-Comes with USB converter that you use to charge the battery and upload music from your computer (I charge it using my computer)<br />-Battery life is at least a few hours/several days of working out<br />-Has a shuffle/random setting, hold button, pause button, fast forward skip, and rewind/backwards skip buttons as well as volume adjustment<br /><br />---CONS<br />-No screen<br />-No folder/playlist options (unless you have shuffle on, songs will play in the order you uploaded them)<br />-The last one I purchased didn't have as strong a clip as previous ones (slides off my shirt if I'm running strenuously). This could just be a fluke, since I've never had this problem before with previous ones.<br />-Sometimes I wish it would turn up louder. Some of my music files are on the quiet side so if I'm near traffic I can't hear them as well as I'd like to- however, this could be a headphone problem. Most of the time, it is plenty loud.<br /><br />Love this product because I can listen to music while working out and not have to carry it. I don't have to worry about it breaking or falling, because it is so inexpensive to replace. It's very small and practically weightless. Uploading music is simple- think dragging mp3 files onto a thumb F: drive. Charges quickly and holds battery life long enough. I also purchased a USB wall outlet for super cheap so I can charge it when I'm not around my computer. Overall, a great bargain for the price if you're looking for a lightweight, no-frills shuffle mp3 player!"
An Otterbox Defender series was not available when I ordered the Moto G (3rd gen.) so I chose the his case because it had a belt clip holster & kickstand. I like how easily it fits though it could use an integrated plastic screen protector. It also shipped sooner than expected which is always a plus. Quite pleased with this purchase & saved about $43 (as compared to Otterbox pricing). Thanks.
"Nice and convenient when multiple people in the car need to charge and they're all different types of devices. (i-phone, droid, tablet, etc)"
"Phone is extremely heating on the back side while playing candy crush it seems unusual, lags are also there on the lock screen. Screen is heating while voice call. Battery is depleting rapidly while gaming like 20% in 15 minutes. My experience with yureka plus is going well."
"works great, highly recommended if you're using a bumper case with this phone. item arrived quickly and in good shape as well."
"Exactly what I wanted. It's very thin and smooth, doesn't look bulky. I'm not sure how well it would protect the phone if I dropped it but so far so good."
works perfect
works perfect
This digitizer worked perfectly. After trying two others from local online suppliers whom I suspect were recycling parts without testing this one worked and is still working flawlessly. The tool kit and screen cleaning cloth were very helpful.
"I was hesitant to get the Rugby 4 because the reviews were pretty mixed, but there aren't many flip phones around, my sturdy but ancient Nokia was dying, and the Rugby was the only one with the features I wanted.  All told I'm pretty satisfied with it, but it definitely has its problems.  The phone feels solid and the hinge feels like it'll endure.  Voice quality is good.  It weighs a bit more than I expected, but that's a minor matter.  Although I didn't specifically want a ruggedized phone, which probably contributes a bit to the weight, I managed to drop it three times on the first day so I'm glad about that anyway.  The navigation keys are a little too small, so I often press something I don't want.  As has happened to others, the phone randomly turned itself off -- twice on the third or fourth day I owned it, and once more a few days later -- but it hasn't done it since then (a couple weeks?)  so maybe it was just the battery breaking in or something.  ** Later edit: apparently I had the phone open when I found that the volume controls turned off silent mode; when phone is closed, the volume controls have no effect.  On the other hand, the phone's turned itself off a couple more times.  The operating system, unfortunately, is very poorly thought out.  The address book is bizarre: you can assign a person four different types of mobile phone number, but not a single landline number.  I have yet to encounter a business that only works with mobile phones, except for construction contractors, and many of them also keep a landline.  Many individuals maintain a landline too (like me).  On the other had there's a field for a fax number.  Now, even if many places still had faxes, how would a mobile phone use one?  There's a field for home address but not business address.  Etc.  Unlike my previous phone, you can only have one note per address book entry.  Also, you can only put a few, mostly pre-selected items in the shortcut list.  So, for example, you have to dig through a few menus to put the phone into silent mode; it would be better to be able to put that on your shortcut list, but that's not possible.  Speaking of silent mode, for some reason Samsung stupidly lets the volume controls turn it off.  So if you have the phone on silent, put it in your pocket, and a volume button somehow gets pressed, guess what, your phone will go off while you're in a meeting or at a movie.  So the safest bet is to turn the phone off completely.  The GPS only gives directions if you have a subscription for it with AT&T.  (Unfortunately I didn't know that when getting the phone, because GPS was on my &#34;want&#34; list.)  Also it seems that if you don't make AT&T the home page on the browser, your browsing will often get DNS errors, so don't bother trying to put a particular web page among your shortcuts, and accept that you'll get dinged for data usage to view a web page you don't want.  (Hopefully that will stop when I get around to unlocking the phone.)  There's a manual on the Samsung website, but it leaves some things to be desired.  For example, if you connect the phone to your computer, it will ask if you want mass storage or Samsung Kies -- with no explanation in the manual of what Samsung Kies is.  You have to dig around the Samsung website to discover that Kies is a progam that lets you transfer files and backup and edit the address book.  Incidentally Kies includes the fields one would think an address book entry should have (e.g., landline numbers), but they won't transfer to the phone that way.  Still, once I got the phone set up and accepted the fact that the OS was developed by dolts, it did what I wanted it to do, and I appreciate the ruggedization now."
I added these to my iPhone EarPods for running and they work great!  Sound quality is better and EarPods have a better fit. Before you spend a bunch of money on another set water resistant headphones give these a try.
"This is a pretty awesome case.  Wasn't expecting much, but can find anything bad to say about it.  Not only is it a solid case, it's screen protectors aren't bad at all.  The Note 5 is pretty light and feels pretty fragile, but this adds just the right amount of weight to make it feel solid.  Comes with nice little extras.  Two protectors, one for front and one for back.  The one for the back is to stop the rainbow effect because the back is glass.  I also think it would help if any dirt or grit gets behind the case. The case also comes with a little film on the front and back of the case to protect it during shipping.  Again just a little thing to is nice.  Also the dust caps for the charger port and headphone jack fit nice and tight.  If you are looking for a good case, this one is worth well more than they are charging."
"This case is very cute and it does it's job of protecting your phone if you drop it, but it broke VERY easily when taking it off. I switch my batteries out often since I have an extra battery that charges outside the phone. The case cracked down the top middle the first time I took it off and then cracked a little more down the back each time I took it off again. The case is made of what feels like a soft plastic which is why it was so easy to crack. If you plan on leaving your case on all the time (like a normal person) then this case is great. BUT if you take your case off a lot or like to switch cases often, I don't recommend this product.<br /><br />Also, the stand was VERY hard top open up and use at first. I had to open it and close it a lot to break it in so it would finally open with ease. Once I did that, the stand was amazing."
It is to tight when you have the Otter box on your phone.<br />Very hard taking the phone out of the leather case.
"I must own more than 5 different iPhone cases for my iPhone 6+ but the is my preferred one now.  It offers good protection, good hand feel and the card slot works well because there is a mechanism to prevent cards from dropping out."
Very pleased real quality don't fuss with those plastic screen protectors this one blows all the plastic ones away.
This case is great!  The storage door closes securely.  I am able to fit my drivers license and a credit card.  I have had this for about 1 1/2 years and it has held up well.  After one too many drops the door recently got a crack.  It makes it a little difficult to close but once closed it still hold my card securely.  The hole for the camera did not interfere with taking pictures.  Most headphones and power cords fit as well.  It is a tight secure fit on the phone so this not something that can be taken off and on easily.
"Awesome screen protector! I was having touch issues on my G4 with my previous tempered glass cover, this one is much better and much more responsive!"
Front case does not like to stay on.
"The PowerJive blocks are as advertised. As in cables, you cannot have enough of these around the house or office. The blocks are sturdy and USB plugs fit firmly. There is no wiggle. These have the appearance as the stock blocks that come with an iPhone.<br /><br />I tested the output of these PowerJive blocks and the results were good. They met the 5v 1A claim. See my pics below for the result of the test."
It wouldn't sync with any of my iPhones and the quality seemed pretty bad.  Also the plastic part that went on your ear seems awkward and uncomfortable.  This is your typical you get what you pay for made in China junk.
I received the universal bike mount and was very excited about my purchase.  It fit the bike and was easy to put on and works great.  Now I have a place to carry my cell phone when riding.  I would recommend the universal phone mount to a friend.
Very well please with the dock and play if I had the chance and I needed another one I would buy again
I love it. Looks and feels great. What can you say about a simple phone case other than it looks like the pic came right on time with prime two day shipping and seems durable enough. For the price it is great. Everything lines up like it should. All the slots and buttons line up perfectly and the headphones seat properly. I hate when you get a cover that things are off like that. So very nice. Seems durable but I just got it so can't comment on that yet but will if there is an issue I will update. I don't think there will be it feels like its made of good quality material and design.
Bluetooth still in use still working only one problem I'm having with the Bluetooth it does not tell me who's calling but it doesn't matter still everything is A OK
great Product.no instructions but look it up on YouTube
It didnt last a year as a car charger!
"[[VIDEOID:f8ef8c6c7d56750ad91fb50c6d4ca3c5]] ✏️ Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />I like this cable adapter (converter) because:<br />- There are 3 ports (HDMI, VGA, and DVI) from which I can choose. I've had to carry around three separate adapters before. (actually I have a sweet VGA and HDMI adapter, but I didn't know they also made one that has DVI, like this one. Awesome!)<br />- It works in my MacBook Pro.<br />- The image is beautiful.  No distortion as far as I can tell. (I'd recommend always trying to use the HDMI port)<br />- While it's surprisingly big, it's certainly smaller than three whole converter cables together.<br />- Fits nice and snug into my Macbook Pro and doesn't wiggle out.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration. Hope this demonstration and test helps!<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely."
It's a nice touch especially with the Chevy cobalt...... Bought it for my boy friend.... Fits perfectly in 06'..... And a little cubby in the bottom...... Hands free
i absolutely love this case. It shipped super fast and is exactly as pictured/described. Unlike other cases this one has 4 card slots which is what i was looking for. Mine also came with a screen protector and one of those watersafe ziplock bags that you can put your phone into if you are doing water sports like kayaking or paddle boarding. Overall great product
Anker is a great brand. Love their products. This charge is great for travel. Light and powerful. I bought one more for my wife as well. Great buy.
"Excellent radio. Get one, you'll love it."
"Works for the most part. Unlike the original cradle, I sometimes I have to wiggle the watch or the USB cable to make it work."
"This is a great charger. I like that it has a well placed light to tell you if it's charging. This charger is a great color of purpley-red to add a little fun to your accessories. This color makes it certain that my husband and sons will not pick my charger up and take off with it! I've had no problem with this charger. We own several vehicles, and I got tired of forgetting to grab a charger from another vehicle or not realizing I didn't have one until my phone beeped that it was dying. Because of this I decided I was getting chargers for every vehicle."
"I bought tone of these awhile back to help track a troubled family member's car (for actual safety reasons - no wife spying going on! ). Could not get the thing to work. Tried two SIM cards, followed the directions ( kind of hard to cipher ). Maybe one of these days someone will clue me in on how to get this thing working. I&#34;m a very technical person, btw."
Bought it for the higher capacity over another brand that is less amps... this one was worse. Did not hold a charge as long as the phone itself. Would not buy again. Not as easy to take the phone in and out of the case.
exactly what i needed and it was easy to find a video tutorial online. Never go to the apple store for help.
"shipped with europen plug, but bought adapter and the pack works great for my laptop"
"While the slide back and forth from each country or plug can be awkward from time to time, this is a great practical tool to bring along overseas.  Love that it has two USB ports and one plug.  If you have Apple products, the USB ports can sometimes be in competition.  This is a problem that I've identified with other adaptors, so not necessarily an issue with this product.  We ordered two and made daily use of them."
"I am torn on the amount of stars I would give this product. I ordered this for my Iphone 6 plus, which I am afraid may be a tad too heavy for this product. The connection plugs nicely into my center console, however, while driving my phone will slowly make its way down until it is laying on the center console or spin around. I have tried to set it up differently but continue to get the same results. Like I said, I like the product, I just dont think it is good with the weight of the 6 Plus."
"This product was a complete waste of money.  The screen protector is nothing more than a thin film of plastic.  It is water proof, however, it is made of very cheap brittle plastic and lacks any durability what so ever.  Mine broke in the pocket of my dress pants after only a week. I never dropped even dropped it or had a chance to take it out camping or anything.  Don't waste your money on this."
Works as expected. Not much more to say than that!
"Great case. I have my own landscaping business and have a tendency to drop my phone, run it over with a mower tire, get caught in the rain, etc. This case has protected it from everything. Took one star away because the built-in screen protector feels pretty cheap but still works."
"It's a good product. I do wish you could more easily use the touch screen on my phone when it's in the case,  but so far the case keeps my phone dry :)"
"It was good the first couple of days, then it turns off by itself, when I press the unlock button it takes like 30 seconds to show the unlock screen, battery drains way to fast not very happy"
"The magnets not the strongest, but other than that its amazing!"
"The cover under the plastic purple is a little loose on the phone, almost as if it's too big. Yet to see if this causes any problems, or is more just an annoyance."
Perfect fit and looks good on my stainless steel with the modern buckle of the Apple Watch.
"bad screen ,slow to touch ,faded colors started getting spots in screen after cpl weeks"
these super shields go on smooth and  EZ. but I really did not need 6 of them. although the price was great. I would buy them again.
"One word of warning.. if you upgraded a win8 computer to 8.1 you MUST find upgraded 8.1 bluetooth drivers, or unit will NOT function!  this warning should be included.  Past that, product when everything is upgraded.. sound is awesome!  product easily connects to bluetooth devices.. No complaints here!"
"Fixed a galaxy s4 for a friend's daughter.  I took my time watched numerous vids online and did i mention I build circuit boards (thru hole and surface mnt)  for over 15 yrs now.  So I am well versed with electronic repair.  The board fit perfectly.  When I was done I plugged it in and it charged fine, I made a few calls and the mic worked properly.  I ordered this board from &#34;YUE DA TIME&#34;  from Amazon and the one I got worked perfectly.  I would say though if you have never done this work before go slow, and be observant of what you are doing.  Ppl tend to rip and tear and make the situation worse before they even get the new board in.  Be sure to remove the tape because there is adhesive that needs to be secured.  The process is fairly simple if you just take your time and do it right the 1st time.  From my experiences, brute force and electronic repair do not mix well.  Thx again fixed a s4 for under $10.00"
"Two of the screen protectors were already scuffed up when I got them. Then the sticker that's on the bottom wouldn't come off. Long story short,  if you have a $700 phone don't buy $3 screen protectors."
"We all have numerous electronics that require usb charging cables.  When we travel we used to have to take multiple plugs etc.  Not all hotels have power outlets in convenient locations and this solves that problem in one easy to carry item.<br /><br />As the amazon description mentions:<br />The power cord is pretty long, ( just under 5 feet) and can easily wrap around for transportation.<br />The plug has a convenient snap in spot as well.<br />It does not mention that they include a handy drawstring travel bag for the unit. (nice touch).<br /><br />So far, I have a Note 4, and an LG G watch plugged into it at night. I'll also be charging a Kindle every so often at the same time.  No issues with charging, I can not speak to the speed of the charge, as I have them plugged in all night and in sleep mode. However, I have a full charge by the time I wake (about 5 hrs later).  That is usually from a 35% charge to 100%, again I am not able to report how long that takes,, as I sleep through it.<br />This will be easy to toss in a carry-on bag for trips, or my laptop bag to and from work. I have no need for the universal plug, but who knows, maybe one day.<br /><br />I received this item for free or discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
"This is a very easy to install phone holder. You simply slip the small metal plate on the inside of your phone cover and attach it to the magnet on the mount. The mount itself is small and unobtrusive. I have mine attached to the windshield by suction cup, although you could similarly mount it to the dash. It's difficult to understate the convenience of this holder. You literally just place the phone in front of the magnet and it attaches on. Good for most modern smart phones."
"Not a lot to say, except that this strikes me as a very well-made item. It's sturdy, and I feel it keeps my phone safe. I'm very pleased with it."
"First and foremost I admit that I am super anal about taking care of my cell phone. I typically will have each one for about three years and therefore want it to last as long as possible. I just got a nexus 6 on project fi and intend for it to be my only device for quite a while. With that being said a good case and screen protector are key. This screen protector is crystal clear. The fact that it is not flexible makes it the easiest I have ever installed, dust free and aligned properly on first try. Usually not an easy feat. I am not a good reviewer for scratch resistance as I never put the phone in a situation where it can be scratched but it seems as good as any other i have ever used (typically spigen). The only issue I have with it is the fit. The cutouts are the perfect size and shape for all the phones features (speakers, sensors, etc.) but it is slightly too large to make a 100% seal. What I mean is the edges of the screen are ever so slightly curved so around 1-2 mm of the entire periphery is not stuck down to the screen. Not a huge deal for most I assume but i'm sure dust will build up in this area over time and cause me two problems. One is aesthetics, it just won't look good with all that junk under it. Two, that dust will act as sandpaper over time and start to cause a cloudy look around the edge of the screen due to thousands of microscopic scratches. This may not be an issue for some at all but it is for me. I will upload pictures when I get a chance to take them.  1 Week Edit: Still performing well in the protection aspect. Just as I had suspected there is a large amount of dust gathering around the edge of the screen protector where it is not completely stuck down. It is not just under but gathering under it and sticking out the sides making this &#34;fuzz&#34; border around the screen protector. I will still give it 3 stars because I am super anal and this probably won't bother most people but I may be looking for something different soon."
We have used these for years.  They work good but seem to only last about 5 years.
I LOVE this case!  Wish I could find more designs like it!
Has a hard time getting in the charge position.  You have to make sure it sits in the lighter outlet a certain way in order for it to work.  Pain to get to work.
It's been on  my fitbit a month.  Not sure I want to keep it on as three  of the corners are peeling up.
"This was a great 1st time purchase experience with Amazon. this is an awesome product, from the price to the shipping time."
Fit perfect and I love it.  I have ahd it for a couple of months already and it still looks new to me.
Loving this case so far.  Have dropped my phone several times from 3ft+ and have had no issues thus far.
"I LOVE this little gadget!! I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 and it fits perfectly. It clips over the top of the phone, to cover over the eyepiece. I just started experimenting with the fish eye lens (photo attached, don't judge!)  : )  -  makes a great, super affordable gift! I've given two of these away as gifts and both recipients thought their new little phone camera lens kit was the coolest thing ever. Comes with a cloth carrying bag... easily fits into a pocket or small purse compartment."
"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn't interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
"It's a good product and has apparently saved my phone many times from cracking.  However, I Believe it cracks a little too easy.  I've never dropped my phone on a hard surface, or landed it on a rock - anything that would really what I deem this much damage.  However, this screen protector does look great and protect the screen - just question its durability."
"Fits very well and isn't too bulky.  It has just the right amount of grip without being sticky, so it'll slip into your pocket easily, but you don't have to worry about it slipping out of your hand.  Shipping was fast, too!<br /><br />If I have any gripes at all, it's just that I wished the power button was just a little more pronounced, not a big deal though."
"Good:  Works in my 2003 Civic if I plug it in, attach my phone, unplug it for 5 seconds, and then plug it back in. Bad:  Doesn't work in my 2013 Tundra at all even following the plug/unplug/plug procedure.  UPDATE:  After 7 months of use the three metal pieces on the end have fallen off.  One of them went missing so the whole thing is a loss now."
"So far the bands seem to work great and I have had no problems.  The only disappointment I have is I thought I would get 12 different colors, but 4 of the twelve I received are black.  I would have given 5 stars if I would have received 12 different colors."
"Did not like. Felt cheap, and the cover was sticky. Could not access any of the side buttons and had to take it off almost everytime i wanted to use my phone"
Forms worship to foreign countries to members of the family at this present time there was no feedback about any one of the phones are is not working so all phones are ok 4-star rating
This was not the phone case that was shipped to me. The butterfly pattern is correct but the case pictured here is not what I received. The picture shows a ballistic case with raised rubberized corners. What I received was a simple plastic phone cover not what is advertised here. I am extremely unhappy with the &#34;Bait and switch&#34; that happened.
"Update: they've improved the magnet quality in this substantially, making all my old complaints invalid. It is my favorite travel dock, I keep one in my with bag for whenever I rent a car. The only downside is it can be easy to forget in a car and if you rent a lot you might lose it. I'd buy more than one. Very sticky and firm, even sticks to the wireless charging coil inside of my phone eliminating the need for the metal pad being attached<br /><br />Old review: Not that great. Vibrations from the road make the phone slide around on the mount changing angle and rotation. If you don't have a case for your phone you have to apply the metal piece to the phone itself, which is undesirable, but the strength through a case is not good enough for reliable use. okay for backup in a rarely used vehicle, don't recommend as primary solution.<br /><br />Edit: Company contacted me and supplied a different phone mount, that is not magnetic but springing clamp design. It's not what I wanted but I appreciate that they tried to rectify my problem. I like this brand for other products and would not avoid them in the future because of this phone mount not being for me. Good customer service."
Good quality case. Took a little longer to get here than I liked but it was inexpensive but good quality
"Great case for my iphone 6. Its not too bulky so I can still get my phone into my pocket or purse. It doesn't add a lot of weight either, only 1.6 oz. It is properly designed so that all the holes line with the phone properly. Most importantly it is a beautiful color. This is case has extra protection on the corners for when you drop your phone. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.<br />Comment"
"Wait till i get my hands on Nokia, Boost & whoever else has their hands in on this garbage phone. I have service through boost, on my iphone...PERFECT...on this...NEVER...even in the begginings of the month. Boost tells me it all depends what phone you buy. The 30$ ones from walmart work better than this garbage. What a waste."
"Unfortunately, all 4 of them failed in 4 days. First one will not charge whatsoever although the phone says connected. 2nd one tip broke off at the base (never seen that before). last 2 ones will not charge of do anything. honestly, the worst wires I have ever bought. Be aware!"
Fits perfectly. Easy to hold without fear of slipping out of hands. Nice design. Highly recommend!
Nice  case gold is almost same color gold as the phone fits the phone perfect
Does what it's supposed to...nothing too special. Grips is sturdy.
Works great and easy to use. I now have surround sound on my TV and can hear shows over the humming air conditioner. My only gripe is that the sound from the TV doesn't sync with the Bluetooth sound in speakers so I have to mute the TV. For 20 bucks I'm happy
"good price , quick delivery."
It works as advertising.
"I wanted these headphones for workouts.  I only used them for weightlifting (no high intensity cardio, etc.) and I could not keep them in.  They were a pain and I was constantly messing with them.  They may be great to watch a movie or to listen to music while stationary, but NOT while working out.  The sound was great, but they did not meet the needs of what I wanted."
So far battery life is good. But found it very slippery. I bought some adhesive bumpons to put under it so it will not slip.
"Very happy with the product, and the additional small free gifts / accessories included.<br /><br />Was delighted when the protective case arrived a full two weeks before the estimated time of delivery"
I've used this mount while traveling a number of times now and it has been very useful.  No problem attaching to air vents in car and holds strong.
Good product. Fits very well and easy to switch with original band. It can get scratched pretty easy though but that's common with wear. Somehow I believed this item would come with tools to do swap out old band with this one but it didn't. That was my only disappointment.
"I am very finicky when it comes to my phone cases. I am very hard on my phone, dropping it at least twice a day. Losing it in the bottom of my purse. Dripping water on it. You name it, I've probably done it. So I need a case that is durable and will at least protect it when I drop it or lose it. When I was offered this case at a free / reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review I decided I had nothing to lose and took the offer. That being said, this case is made of durable, high quality materials. I have dropped my phone and lost it in my purse a few times since getting this case and it has protected it better than I ever thought it would. I was very surprised with this case. The color is fabulous and it fits my phone perfectly. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a phone case."
"My order just came today - earlier than expected!!! Very nice case - just as described. Only negative comment I can make is about the magnetic closure flap - it feels a bit flimsy. But overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase. Phone can be charged while still in the case. You won't be able to find a phone case like this at your neighborhood mall selling at this great price!  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010NFD0GC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00"
First off the phone never fit properly in the case. We had to jamb it all together and even then there was a gap around it. Then within a couple days the diamonds started falling out and finally the kickstand broke after about a month. It's a pretty bulky case as well.
"Fits phone good husband likes it a lot. Seems to help with the outside keys as well, easier to turn sound up or down."
"Display is as good as the original. I own more than one of these model phones so can make a side-by side comparison. The display is just as clear, bright and colorful as the original. Touch response is identical.<br /><br />Just find and follow a You Tube guide, take your time and don't forget to remove and reuse the speaker from the old screen. I heated my speaker a little with a hair dryer and pushed it from the front and it came out with no problems.<br /><br />The tool kit is pretty cheap, but good enough to perform the replacement operation the one time you will need it. If you plan to do this type of work for a hobby or a living, you should just buy a better grade of tools.<br /><br />Start to finish, 30 minutes."
"Virtual partner function is excellent. Sets it apart from the lower level watches. Great interface. Easily tweaked, has like 54 potential data fields I believe. Can be used for hiking as well with its return home function. Awesome system for pacing and tracking mileage."
"I've only had the unit about three weeks, but during that time I've used it successfully on two trips keeping both an iPhone and gps charged.  If the unit becomes fully discharged, it takes 5 or 6 hours to fully recharge.  However, it does seem to hold a charge for several days standing idle."
Perfect fit and fits like a coin in tha hand!<br />The battery is really nice and it extended my battery life from 1 day to 2-3 days without charging! :)
"The case was in fine condition but the image is shifted and cut-off by the hole for the camera, as well as part of his feet are cut-off by the bottom."
"I would recommend  buying the whole bracket with the screen in it.  It wasn't fun replacing  for the cheap glass to Crack,  in  less than a week after the install.  And the tools pictured were not with the package."
Great product
"This item worked great for two weeks.  I was hoping Monet was a good brand after I saw similar adapters were duds.  After two weeks, it died. It took me a while to write the review as I don't drive the Acura that much. Much promise...greater disappointment I bought another unit hoping I receive a defective unit.  The second unit failed within 10 days."
"Perfect for protecting the iphone 6.  I was able to put my phone in with the Otter cover, perfect fit and gives you an extra sense of security to protect your  expensive cell phone."
"Can't live without my Mophie as I'm in her phone so much on calls and texting, my phone without round die around Noon. Not cool when you got an afternoon of conference calls. Now I never have my phone die, got lots if power snd only charge at night. Worth every penny."
The sound quality is surprisingly bad; it gave me a headache.  I have several pairs of headphones that I paid about $10 for and they sound much better.
This Qi charger works great at a fraction of the cost of the OEM brand.  I've yet to be disappointed by Anker.
I have not got to use it as of yet . I know that it is a quality radio . I'm working on my ham license .My Elmer told me that it was a good mobile radio
I don't really like the pull-out for the charger or the earphone love the texture tho and the card case only holds 2 without the worry of it popping open.. I do like it tho. I just have more cards then that so I ordered another probably use this for when I only need to carry 2 cards!!
"It's okay because of the length only, that part is nice.  But, it is really slow in charging your phone, takes a full 8 hours to charge to 100%, maybe, or more.  But, if you need a long cord while your power is down and you have a convenient wall plug, this will allow you to get further from it and use your phone.  I'm thinking like charging stations where you have one guy sit right in front of all the plugs."
"I have tested this unit for a month or so and it has out preformed every dash-cam system I've tested to date. This system requires a micro USB card to operate (record and still shots), which was no big deal for me, as I had an extra. You will need to download an proprietary app to run this camera system. Using this app you set up the camera. I started my test indoors with plugging the unit into a USB power brick. If you don't put the micro USB card in as soon as you power it up it will beep continually until you do. The first major hurdle to setting the camera is to connect to the camera's wifi server. It took about 5 attempts before successfully connecting the phone to the camera.  As soon as the connection is made you can the easily navigate the app and see live streaming of the camera's view. You can then pare up the small remote button that comes with this camera. The button allows you to activate still shots or record. This remote is key to operation as it allows for quick operation of the camera. Once your camera is up and running you can see the awesome quality of the video stream. It is an adjustable stream, so you can dial it into a perfectly clear faster stream rate. I used this camera in just about every setting, I went with 1080p as that offered the clearest field of view.  I took it outside and mounted it in my Lincoln SVU. It wouldn't suction behind the mirror as it has those small black dots made into the windshield, so I had to lower mine, so it is in your field of view while driving.  You should know your states laws about driving with something stuck in the field of view because this may get you a ticket if it is considered an obstruction.  Once I got it to suction on to the windshield, I then made a connection to the power port in the SUV.  I left my cord dangling as I determined that you need to unplug it after use, my unit didn't disconnect from the power like it should have, not a big deal, but something to note. I think is more related to the fact that my power ports don't shut off when the vehicle is turned off.  If you car or truck shuts down the ports you should have no issue with mounting this as a permanent fixture. The first time is operated this camera I had my wife drive as I operated the camera using the app. You can watch the live feed and take still shot from the cell phone app too. Once you are outside the camera's wifi reception area you can only review previous clips and still shots taken. Once you reconnect to the camera's wifi you can then view what was recorded when you are away from the vehicle. The camera has a green and blue light on the back side facing you that stay on while in use, on of them is a constant light, the other blinks. This may bother some people especially for night time driving, but it didn't affect me. The suction cup has stayed in place even in extreme heat, as of yet no cold weather testing has been available. I will update to let you know if weather changes effect the ability to stay on the windshield.  This is an easy to use and operate system that allows you to view the camera footage without taking out the micro USB card. If you remove it and place it into a adapter then you can easily use it with you computer to view and save shots or videos. For me to post a video I need to take this stream and convert it, so I will post that as well.fact that my power ports don't shut off when the vehicle is turned off.

For me to post a video I need to take this stream and convert it, so I will post that as well."
I am so gad that you had a battery for my phone.  The battery works fine no problems at all.  Thank you.
I would like to know if anyone else gets a single beep when starting your vehicle? It lasts for a second tops. Only beeps once when starting my car.
Working  great I would recommend this product
Worked for a day then simply stopped responding to touch. Day three the screen went black and never came back on
"Originally purchased it for use as a PC microphone that I could use without having to wear a whole headset. It worked well but I was limited by the battery life (about 3 hours) so didn't work well for longer gaming sessions. I wasn't too upset because it was only a few bucks. Now I use it while I ride my bike to college. Totals about 2 hours a day. I listen to music from my phone. It works well for this because it allows me to keep one ear open for situational awareness, and also because of how it is nestled in your ear it makes it very difficult to fall out. It sometimes causes me irritation if I wear it for too long, usually over 2 hours at once. But that is uncommon and very bearable when it does happen. I could not reccommend this earpiece more. It is very discreet and I have used it while working (at a bar) to listen to music and very few people noticed it. If you aren't sure about this earpiece I would say you should at least try it. For a few dollars it very well may surprise you."
"Works as expected. Good product, great price."
Watched their installation video and followed the isntructions but  air bubbles don't go away even witha  squegee.  Used 2nd protector. same thing.<br />I've used a few other screen protector brands and this has to be the worst!
Perfect fit for the back pocket on a pair of standard men's Levis jeans! Stick one of these in your pockets when you're out and about and traveling and put your cell phone in the other pocket and you're now walking around with more than twice the battery capacity you had before. If your phone is slim enough this charger pack will even fit in your pocket so you can charge on the go.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper products out there but this one is definitely the thinnest and lightest one for the price point.
I love my Argon Technologies Bluetooth Wireless speaker. Its seemlessly connects to my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and my iPad. The sound coming from this little device is large and clear. Great product for the price.
"Nice case, fits the iPhone 6 with Spigen Slim Armor Case perfectly."
"Best case I've ever bought, thats saying a lot! Fit and finish are outstanding. Quality build and protects the phone like it should."
"Bought it and stuck it in the car port, but did not use it for months.  Then discovered that it will not power up an iPad or iPhone.  Too late to return.  Oh, well, live and learn."
These are absolute junk. Pay whatever extra money and get something that fits your I-pad. By the time you cut these to fit. you have a sharp edge on the sides that catches on everything. Pure and simple trash!!!
"perfect in every way. Charges with no problems. It does take some time to charge this unit, but it charges phones and ipad very fast."
Easy setup. Nice design and I like the added led lights while phone is charging. Charges phone about as fast as standard charger. I drain the battery nightly and simply place my phone on top before bed and wake up to a fully charges phone. Cheaper than some other 3rd party chargers and more visually pleasing in my opinion. Great buy.
"Anker makes excellent 3rd part products for all mobile devices.  They are my first choice of manufacturer, cable was 10 feet long, is thick and sturdy and works well.  Can't ask for much more"
"Works only one month, even worst than Apple OE."
Excellent customer service and product.
Fast shipping. Very good fit! Even come with a little key chain flashlight.
"The case is colorful but does not come with a strap. The hole is there but no strap for it. I was expecting it to have one. No biggie, just an FYI."
This doesn't work on my phone (Galaxy 3) due to some idiotic thing that Samsung added with the last update. It works like a champ on my husband's phone.
If you like looking at a dust ring on your screen by all means buy it. The fact that they left the circle hallow is a fail. A thin sheet of plastic on the circle would of made the case perfect.
Does not fit Samsung s5
"bad quality,cannot cover the screen,easily dirty."
I bought this because I've recently started working on a building site and didn't want my phone getting clogged up with dust and dirt. But I also work in a bar and decided to test the ruggedness of the waterproofness(?). So I decided to put some paper in it and put the case through the dishwasher there and the case came out unscathed and the paper as dry as it should be. I am perfectly happy with this case
Meh...the color is not so great but I only use this for the club when I need my ID and cell phone handy. It'll do for now but I woudln't recommend the gold case. It def has more of a blah brown to the majority of the case...only the pocket is a pretty gold color.
Good case but takes awhile to charge back up and makes a whining sound while charging the battery pack back up.
"It gets kind of blurry on the edges of the picture when I use the wide range lens but I didn't expect it to be 100% perfect given its not that expensive.  Overall, I really like the product. I would definitely recommend it."
These headphones lasted about a week before shorting out. If I could give them a zero that would be my honest rating.
"This was OK at first, but after 4-5 uses of 1-2 hours each, the right ear bud does not work. I really expected a better build quality from these. My kids' wired earbuds from the dollar store have lasted longer."
"Great phone.  This was an upgrade from S3mini, and it meets all needs, except one important one.  Kitkat operating system does not allow 3-rd party apps to write to the SD card, so it is not possible to use ES explorer or other apps to move files from PC to phone without plugging the phone into the PC.  This is a significant downgrade in capability, and I may have to root this phone to fix it.  I will wait till it is out of warranty to try, before I do."
I like this case.  It's slim and protects the HTC M8 fairly well.  Looks really good on the phone and feels good in hand.  The only negative is that the silicone piece fits really loose.  The could have made it a little tighter on the side but it's not an issue once you have it on.
"first time i &#34;tried to attach&#34; the legs, the base broke into many sharp pieces resulting in a large cut in the palm of my hand"
"Great deal. Didn't realize this came with 3 screens when I got it, which was a nice surprise. The screen was nearly fool-proof for applying cleanly and perfectly aligned with all the hand tools included. There's a link to the video instructions to make the application easy to understand. Recommend this product"
Exactly as described! ! Fit the phone great.
great fact replacement speaker thank you
Tried all 3 charger wires. One of them never worked! And the other 2 only worked for about 3 days each.
"Awesome delivery, fast and received as described and few extra things.  Thanks<br /><br />However case screen cracked within a month.  Booooo"
"Never could get it to work, 2 weeks still not working, Instruction sheet SUPER SMALL ,written by someone who has never had to install one"
Love the band  exactly like the apple sport band without the high price will purchase all colors received very quickly.
"Great quality, no tangle, work great for phone calls. Love the color! I'd recommend for someone who wants a great pair at a great price."
"this was a gift for a friend of mine, she says she likes it, the delivery came in a day and a half."
This case fits like a glove. The phone sits in the case like it is supposed to and it doesn't feel flimsy or anything. The rubber part of the case gives a better feel on the phone and helps with the grip while the plastic part helps with the protection.
"I just got this case.  It's great looking, fits my phone perfectly and has a solid grip.  This is the nicest phone case I've ever had."
Cover fit well and I was able to use the phone without a problem.
"Don't buy no matter how pretty you think it is. This case is flimsy, the edges don't snap shut like they should to lock it in place. The case is heavy too. I loved my old casemate case for my iphone5 but this case was a big disappointment."
The product is ok but I don't like the fact that it says USA Seller and it came from China!  I think Amazon needs to watch this more!
Works really well. Good purchase. Fast shipping.
"Exactly what I was looking for and got it quick.  Great customer service and exactly the product I needed.<br />Thanks, Jim"
"My old battery would not keep a charge...at all...I ordered this one, my husband & I watched a video on how to replace it & my husband replaced the battery. Now my phone works great! It is a little complicated to change battery, lots of little parts...be sure to watch the videos!"
"Doesn't work with Windows Phone, but works great with Android"
"Hubby and I purchased these to help get us focused on becoming more active.  We were disappointed to discover they do not communicate with Hubbies blackberry or even our samsung tablets, but my S5 works great with them.  Downfall of that is Hubby has to wait until he is home from work to enter all his food and see his progress.<br /><br />I do like that we have a team of others using Jawbone, so we are able to encourage each other and hold each other accountable when we stop following our activity goals.<br /><br />We all had a hiccup this past weekend when the server didn't appear to be tracking properly.  According to my Up I didn't take a single step until 2 pm, but I was up and walking by 10 am that day on a beautiful winery tour.  Our whole team had similar issues that day.<br /><br />Otherwise, neat little product."
"Excellent phone! I am using it as a tablet (no phone service) and it's much better than tablets, unless you need a larger tablet to double as a laptop. The size is perfect for my stocky hands, and at less than 5 ounces, it beats even a small tablet, like Fire HD 6, which weighs over 10 ounces. The screen size is the same as iPhone 6 Plus, and for a good reason. Anything bigger than this would be awkward to carry around. The sim card from my defunct tracfone (LG840G, which is not even an Android phone) works in my POSH. It just sees it as a new sim. Of course, if you want to have a cellphone service, you will have to purchase a sim from a service provider (AT&T, T-Mobile, Straight Talk, etc). The screen resolution (1280x720) is quite adequate for all practical purposes; it comes out to about 267 ppi. So far (after a couple of weeks of usage) I would highly recommend this phone, if you want an Android phone (or a small tablet). Note: if you intend to use it only as a tablet, then turn on the airplane mode, so it won't be constantly searching for a cell signal, as it will drain battery. Then turn the WiFi on (in this order)."
I have been using these on my Vivofit 2 for months now. I basically never take my vivofit off and have put it through some pretty tough situations--the display still looks brand new. This is cheap insurance and if you have a vivofit you NEED these.
"Best thing I have ever bought on here.  Used hundreds of times.  Saves my life on road trips. Fits ipad perfectly, easy to adjust and mount.  Very easy to use.  Great value!"
"It came earlier than I thought, which is good. It's a very cheap price but the quality is actually really good. It came as it said it would, it's nice and soft and well, clear 😂 I recommend to buy this case if you'd like."
"Great headphones, so easy to use"
Great phone! I'm a month into using it and am really loving:<br />how it runs on lollypop<br />the camera and light gestures<br />the battery life ( I usually have &#62;50% battery left by the end of a moderate use day)<br />the voice control.
This phone is out of my hand but it's working and the person who receive it is loving it no complain no problem man
"Bought 2 of these as they work very well. If/when I lose or put it through the washing machine, I'll repurchase the same one again."
"The car mount is easy to attach and release, and once the phone is affixed to the mount, it seems pretty secure - it hasn't fallen off.  However, the combined weight of the phone and the mount tends to close the vent."
"Love this cord, works great with my iphone 6, gives a fast charge and is entertaining to watch!"
"This thing is pretty cool, and keeps getting cooler.  The dev team behind it is quite active, adding functionality often.  It takes a bit to get used to, and there are still some quirks, but almost everything is configurable through a simple GUI, so you don't need a dev background to put limiters on The Force.  My amputee friends from the military love that this technology is being developed on a more commercial basis, and hope that use of such devices will not remain a novelty, but become mainstream.  I have to admit, I'm almost to the point in Outlook where reading my email with this thing is faster than my keyboard.  Which means it's almost ready for mainstream.  I think the price tag is worth it, and I think the configurability from the GUI allows anyone to really love this thing within a few minutes of putting it on.  I have to say, it was a cool reaction I got in my first meeting where I made a fist and a blue pointer showed up on the wall screen to underscore the service flow I was trying to demonstrate.  I was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, so everyone was looking for a device attached to my computer, and couldn't.  It was great."
"I absolutely love this case. I ordered one for my husband and when I saw the quality of his I had to have one for myself as well. It fits the phone like a glove and I believe it will do a great job of protecting it. My husband dropped his on concrete and not only did it protect the phone, but there was not a scratch on the case either! I ordered the blue/black and it looks awesome. Also, I have not found that the flash on my camera turns my pictures the color of the case as some people said. And the screen protector seems to be very good quality, not cheap and plasticy like some said; I can't even tell it's there. I honestly like this case better than otter box. Would highly recommend it."
I love this!  Keeps all the cords and devices well organized!
I bought this charger for my move across the country and it worked well for the week I used it every day. I have used it maybe 3 times since then and now it doesn't charge my devices. I tested the cable and cigarette lighter with another charger and they both worked so I knew it was the charger. not really worth returning at this point but still disappointed with the quality as my $5 gas station charger has somehow outlasted this one.
"I purchased this at a discounted price, during a promotion, for my honest and unbiased opinion. I got this for my daughter as a joke. She loved it so much but doesn't keep it on her phone all the time. Her job wouldn't be to pleased to see the language on the case. However, she does put it on when she's out and about. The iPhone 6 Case fits perfect and easy to put on and take off. My daughter is obsessed with phone cases, she has one to match all her outfits, mood or purse. So having this one that's fun is perfect for her because she can take it off easily. It doesn't crack like some of the other cases she has. So when she is in a kidding mood she puts this one on, plus black matches everything. I recommend this iPhone 6 Case from YouVogue"
Exactly as described.  Went on easily.  No glare and has protected phone perfectly.
"Wife and daughter use one of the larger battery power banks, that are good for 3-4 charges, but size is a pain to lug around.  I wanted something smaller in size and weight, just good enough for one charge.  This power bank fits the bill, have already put to use a couple times when sightseeing and smartphone was running low after many pictures, googling for maps, and other uses.  Easy to recharge, extremely satisfied."
The only problem I have with this is item is pin that holds the clamp to the the case keeps sliding out of the clamp. I have caught it three times.
great holder for my iPhone 5s.  Just what I was looking for - to use MapmyRide on my bicycle trips.  My phone is already in a shock proof case and fits nicely in this holder.
Piece of junk do not buy this radio....ive had it in my car for a month and a half and the screen stopped working i want my money back
Product comes with one major flaw - the edges are not rounded. This causes a problem in three areas:<br />1. The home key is nestled deep down and does not naturally taper off. This (in myopinion) is uncomfortable and makes touch ID less impactful<br />2. It is difficult to put on a case that will comfortable fit with the tall edges at the end of the screen. (Two cases - both Spigen and different models - did not fit correctly because of this.<br />3. The 'swipe up feature is incredibly frustrating to use because of the added thickness. It worked for me about 33% of the time
Very good substitute for otterbox.  It is more streamlined but seems to give the same type of protection for a fraction of the price.
"did not fit phone, un usable...waste of money"
Great case. Would definitely buy again from this seller.
had to use a bandsaw to trim the clamp so it would close fully on a standard boom style microphone stand.
"I liked having a device that monitored my sleeping patterns and daily steps everyday but unfortunately, the UP 24 was just not designed properly. The small cap/mode button fell out after 3 months and once that happened the silver cap with the Jawbone logo wouldn't go back on properly. I contacted Jawbone and they sent me a replacement and guess what? The same thing happened almost 3 months to the day as well! I'm so over this wristband, its just poor design. In addition, this 2nd replacement wristband its silver cap started scratching my wrist and gave me a bad rash. I took very good care of both wristbands, never getting them wet so I can only imagine how much worse it would have been if I wasn't so careful with it. It's a shame, that they would continue to sell this model and allow people to waste their hard earned money. I'm looking into the Fitbit now."
IIt’s sturdy and protects well against fall but mine arrived scratched and the design chips off pretty easily even on your pocket. .<br />I keep mine because it was going to be used on a construction site so it was going to get scratch anyway. If you are looking for a case that look good for regular use this one is not the one.
Great case and fits amazing looks great to. Very fast shipping
"I didn't even know extension cables existed until I was offered this one for review.  It's perfect when you just need a little bit more length.  It works great, phone charged fine.  You plug this into your phone cord to give it a few more inches.  It's great.<br /><br />I was offered a sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."
"This phone is awesome, ive had allot of phones but this one is by far the best ive ever had, i owned the nokia 1020 and K zoom cause the camera on a phone is the most important feature, i loved both of those phones but this one is far better, the video's this phone produces are beautiful, if you were to buy this phone just for being a camera you will be extremely pleased, also the specs are good enough to play any game the android market has available, also the body of this phone is very nice, removable back plate for swapping battery, and metal frame are awesome, only negatives with this phone are no memory card slot and no optical stabilization. If you wish to see the video quality for yourself click the link below for my youtube channel.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnWW7mkP6ToWFeUo_VrsKTwCUN5b2Hxqc"
not good . keeps on falling down
Great band! Just what I wanted. Nice quality & design. Only downside is if you are a small female. I'm not extremely small but I do have tiny wrists. My band is set on the second to the smallest setting.
"Luv the Luvvitt.  Great protection, good color choices."
I like the concept BUT the back decal does not stay because the side edges keep lifting. I'm glad I order all colors because I had to throw two away. Adhesive needs to be stronger so there is no lifting. The first two I tried were ruined after one day of use.
"Case makes screen shut off when using the voice to text function. I tried it with no case and there's no problem with voice to text and I tried it with my old case , also no problem. So I know it is the new case."
"Just got it. Works so far.  But needed a 3.55mm extension cable so that I could position unit so that it could be seen<br />from front of tv for controlling, monitoring, and pairing.<br />I would have given it 4 stars  but I had to improvise to make it work for my particular application.<br />I needed it to connect to a jack on the back of my tv which is against a wall.<br />The transmitter has a switch and LEDS.  To make this visible I used an extension cable.<br />I would definitely  buy it again  and can recommend it."
"Performed as advertised ensuring the phone was protected when dropped, however only issue was with regards to dust buildup between the cover and the phone which needed to be cleaned out every so often as I work in extremely dusty environments."
This product was provided for a unbiased review.<br /><br />[note]<br />I was talking to the company for about a month trying to get the light adapter the sent me the wrong one a few times. But there lovely support time helped me and got me the peace I need.<br /><br />[packing]<br />This product came in a very well cushioned package and did not have any issues with it being damaged. But also I do feel they could have done a better job packing it but it's ok.<br /><br />[design]<br />This has a really nice look to it its one of the thinnest Wallet battery packs I could find. But sadly it will not fit in my wallet fits amazing in my pocket tho can't even feel it. The front has 4 blue LEDS that will like up to show you the battery percentage<br /><br />[battery]<br />This charger will hold 2000mah and it does amazing for a backup charger. I keep this In my back pocket if my iPhone suddenly dies on me. And it works amazingly<br /><br />[charging]<br />So this has a very unique way of charger. It uses to male ends and connects on them the to a USB to charger it's very different then other ones I have seen but it works! Also yes it's supposed to come with a 8-pin Lightning cable<br /><br />Overall this is a amazing charger and would recommend to any buddy who need a quick pocket battery!<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to a ask me in the comments<br /><br />Once again this Product was provided for a honest I'm unbiased review.<br /><br />-Hunter
Loving this case.  Super easy to put on or remove and has protected my phone from various drops of 3ft+
Looks nice but breaks pretty easily.....
This charger did not work for my Tom Tom Via1535 as stated on the website. When I asked to return the item I was told that I had to pay the shipping even though the product was misrepresented. Don't waste your money.
"Awesome case! Hardly notice it compared to my old one. I love my rugged i-Blason case as well, but this is a nice touch when I don't want the bulk."
Took a little while to get used to the new clasp coming from an up24 but overall I really like it. Tracking has improved.
So far so good! Tested first in my house in a jar filled with water and day after sailing and in the beach.
"Fabulously simple contraption. Goes on the wheel easy. Pops off really easy. Placing the phone in it & taking out also really easy. Can do it with one hand. One important consideration: if my speedometer was in the center & not off to the side, I would not be able to see it. All in all, really like it for when I'm using navigation or when I need to talk while driving. I ordered one for almost everyone I know."
"Overall great selfie stick.  I had to order another phone mount  because my Galaxy Note 4 with Otterbox would not fit.  But,  the stick itself is sturdy.  Would be a little scared to even put smaller phone in mount because the spring is not the strongest.  I ordered a XL RetiCAM for stick  mount.  With that combo,  you will have top-notch unit."
"this case is awesome! barely adds any size, but gives great protection. I'd highly recommend it. I've tried 3 other cases and this is easily the best."
"Decent grip once you figure out its supposed to clip in with the phone sideways, so the clip is open as wide as the phone."
"Works as advertised. Charger can be used to recharge both batteries included, as well as the OEM battery that was originally in the Samsung Galaxy S5."
Great Case bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. Took a bit to ship but it was well worth it for the price!
"Great ear buds. Easy to work, great sound. Use mine while working out, no problems. Worth the long wait to get them shipped"
My original review was that these batteries were junk....however because of my 1 star rating the folks from Anker contacted me and sent me a whole new kit  including 2 new batteries and a charger... They sent several emails and even called me to make sure that I was happy with the order....  they get a 5 star for customer service...however after testing the battery for a month now the only thing is ...it does not quite last as long as the OEM Samsung....
"Cheap plastics - feels cheap. Scratches easily. Glad this was cheap, it landed in the trash and not on my iPhone. My old Griffin case, is way better - even after 2 years of heavy use."
"I must have gotten a bad one, it doesn't do a very effective job of charging my iPhone 6 plus.  Charge for it about 30 in the charge and the battery only increased for 10%. The two USB port worked better from Acepower worked better."
"It was not the one to fit the cell phone that i requested. It was also a gift, and it was so loosely fit that the person dropped the phone a couple of times because it wasn't properly secured due to case was wrong side. The last time the phone fell off the case, it broke, and didn't work anymore. I was do embarrassed because it was also a gift to my sister's phone."
"Much larger than I expected. I guess I didn't look at the photo too closely or read the specs, because this is a pretty sizable USB charging unit. I bought it to replace an older Motorola dual charging block I lost, and was bummed that this was so big. (The Motorola one was the same size roughly of the OEM apple charger one gets with one's iPhone or iPod.) This does a good job of charging my iPhone and Acer tablet at the same time though, and tucked behind the bed, it's not really that much of a problem, but will keep looking for the same size dual USB charger that I had before."
"Shipped vacuum sealed without desiccant.  6 of the 12 colors had multiple breaks in them.  They did not ship all the colors shown in the photo.<br />I have only used the filament to add a touch of color here and there in my e3d hotend, and it prints just fine.<br /><br />See attached picture to see what colors did come in.  I even arranged them in the same orientation and put the extra colors off to the side."
This band is ok. Decent quality. Received it in black as a gift. My GF bought it when they were priced under $10. Has had price hikes 2-3 times since. Not bad for the price but it's getting more expensive which lessens that &#34;pro&#34;.
"I love this handy phone. I plug it into my sell phone in my office when I'm working. I heard you can get radiation from cell phones being close to you head. So I use this one to stop that. Plus it works great for using it on your computer for talking on the phone through the internet instead of through the computer {it's mac and pc compatible and works on any cell phone. Hope this helps you make a choice. And YES there is no volume control on it, I guess because most cell phones have volume controls and computers do also maybe thats why. You can adjust it through them."
"Extremely buggy, the app is horrible and is an eyesore. It'll also randomly shut off power to the device at will.  I don't use it at all anymore. I wish I could get a refund."
"The cabling between the earpiece and the necklace are really flimsy. It didn't come with small size earpiece cover. But not as expensive as the original design (LG, I think)."
Dropped phone with this case on it and it did not protect the phone ...phone broke and never worked again
"This looks and feels nice. It was worth the money. The only downside is that it only has 2 places for cards, technically only one slot for cards and one for an ID. It works for now but if you ha e more 4 cards you need to carry this isn't for you."
"Waaaaaay better than the standard Project Fi case that comes in the Welcome Kit. It's easy to put on the phone, and can take a beating. If and when my current case dies, I'll likely get this one again."
I purchased two Samsung OEM 2.0 Amp Micro Home Chargers to have extra chargers for travel. One of the chargers worked fine but the one that I took to visit my daughter for three weeks did not work and would not charge my phone. I needed to borrow a charger for the rest of my trip. I will have to figure out how to return the non-working charger.
Smooth and slim but still protects well. Great purchase for the cost.
"Although the color of the tassel doesn't appear as dark/vibrant as the pictures, they look great! The case is thin so it doesn't further expand the size of my already-big-enough iphone 6. Worth buying! :)"
Worked fine for a month
"Works well, nice size and price."
"Selfie stick is built very strong, constructed like I would build it. Highly recommend the item as a great buy, it is truly what a professional would have nearby. Remote shutter control over Bluetooth performs flawlessly, easy to set up on my Samsung android cell phone. I would have no reservations recommending it to a friend. Engineering and materials could not have been mated any better. My hat is off to Fugetek, you knocked it out of the park with this item."
Love it.  Only thing I could do with out is the bright blue LED light that flashes when my phone is on the unit.
Not much protection there are so many more cases with more protection and cost much less. I prefer built in screen protectors and this one doesn't have one.
"nice look but 2 days after getting the case, it had dropped on the ground and broke. if you are a clumsy person i do not recommend getting this case it is not durably made at all"
I have these and the 4.0 version and I have to say I like these so much more.  I like the stiff band around the neck much better than the lose one (the lose one used to get stuck when I turned my head).  These are very comfortable and I hardly feel them at all while running.  They are easy to pair and easy to turn on/off.  The battery lasts a long time (but I haven't clocked it).  I have used them for phone calls as well and the sound is great as is noise cancellation.  The only complaint I might have about this is the location of the multi-function button is right over top of the volume button.  When you grab to adjust volume your tendency is to squeeze so I have accidentally dropped calls trying to adjust volume.  This is just a learning issue for me though and will be fine once I adjust.<br />These headphones are a great buy!
Average case at most! Not much protection just looks nice.
I love these tempered glass protectors. This is the third purchase i made on this same iCarez protector brand. It has kept my iPhone's screen beautifully protected since a few years now. Very good quality product. I  really love how my phone hardly gets any fingerprints for regular use; i would need to have very filthy or greasy hands in order to smudge the screen. Totally worth it!
The case was exactly as described. It fits perfectly and the screen protector is as good as any other. This was definitely a good buy!
"I bought a pair of these back in March and only now (late-August) have had a chance to use one of them (the other is a spare). It turns out for my use-case this gadget is pretty-much spot-on.<br /><br />The Steambot Slider works exactly as intended in a Smart ForTwo Pure with the base head-unit which has both a USB and a 3.5mm audio jack for auxiliary device input. The Steambot plugs into the USB (for power only) and the included audio cable connects the output of the Steambot to the 3.5mm audio input. After starting the car I can hear start-up tones from the Streambot from the sound system. It takes me a few moments to start the audio source on my iPhone (I might use the iTunes Music app, the SiriusXM app, or the app for my local NPR station) but once I've started the app, the sound plays through as expected.<br /><br />The only &#34;negative&#34; I have experienced is the 20 second time-out of the Steambot. If I take too long to get the audio app running on my iPhone the Steambot times out and turns off. To turn it back on I have to open the glove box and then unplug/plug the Steambot. This is a slight inconvenience. If the USB and audio port were on the dashboard this wouldn't be much of a inconvenience but in the ForTwo the inputs are in the glovebox so it is what it is."
"The original one that I received has great day time image with wide 170 angle ( exactly what we need for rear-view ). Night vision has horizontal lines covering the screen, looks like I received a defective one.  I understand it could happen for any product due to any reason, the most important point is how the company able to handle the issue for satisfying the customers.  Hisgadget Amy was so quick to respond to my concern by sending me a replacement with no extra charge, the new one performs great, out of my expectation.  Great price, great product quality, especially excellent after-sale service. Highly recommended, very happy."
Didn't hold up well at all. There are several of these that look a lot alike. This is the cheapest one and it broke really quick.
It's my favorite case right now it's slim it's nice and it keeps my iPhone protected at all time.
Bought this cause lost my older jawbone era. Love the case it comes with acts as some extra charge. This unit doesn't hold charge as long as my older one. Fits well sounds great. Love the color.
"It's cute at first but the picture gets scratched/worn off too quickly in my opinion. Also, it picks up a blue tint from jeans. Worst of all the case is not even secure on the phone! I dropped my phone once and the case just burst open and the phone flew out and got scratched!!! I buy cases specifically so they can take the brunt of a fall and protect my phone (and its value) and this basically doesn't do anything that it's supposed to!"
"Stopped working after a month. Go with Anker, this product is garbage."
i purchased this unit through another site it did not do well at all i hooked it up to 3-160 watt solar panels for a total of 480 watts theyre wired in parallel at first it put out about 150 watts in full sun i got that reading using my killawatt meter about 2 minutes later it tripped my GFI plug but continued to show wattage on the killawatt meter meaning it was still running so the anti island feature was not working i had already pulled the plug so it should have turned off but it did not finally a few seconds later it went up in smoke it was throwing lots of smoke out of the vents. i do have another brand of inverter that ive been running for several months without issues so I'm just not sure on the quality of this brand.
"I got these for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter - they fit a little big, but she can still use them without any problems. They are plenty loud enough for her, without getting too loud. Easy to use with the IPad so she can watch her shows."
"Yeah, I really love this phone. Works flawlessly (so far). Not missing anything important when compared to the S6"
This case cannot be beat for the price. I bought it specially because it was so damn cheap. Even if I never use it.
"Its a nice screen protector, but the glue used is sub par. it has already began to raise on the edge of the phone."
Suction cup worked for a while but eventually wouldn't stick to the windshield anymore. I believe this was cause by the heat of summer degrading the plastic.
"Definitely a cheaper arm band, and my boyfriend who has modest arms has trouble getting this to fit comfortably."
It's really nice having 2 ports to plug into - and it works great with my Samsung Note 4 phone.
"Had the case for about a month before it started falling apart. The sides rip away from the back with casual use, horrible quality and would absolutely not recommend."
"Its great..... But..... The sweat depreciates the quality of the product. Also, it begins to tear slowly after so much use. Its basically a cheap sweatband with a plastic sown in design. Well, the plastic is peeling off the hard plastic encasing. Soooooo...... Do NOT spend alotta money on this. Its a great product, but wont last you 6 months. Buy it as cheap as you can get it. Its up to you !"
It protects the back and sides well.  It is a simple design that functions well.  Nice case that does not add a lot of bulk.  It also makes the phone easy to hold on to.
"I have used I don't know how many car chargers (my first one was for a Palm!),  so it isn't that easy for me to be pleasantly surprised (*unpleasantly* surprised, yes, but not pleasantly).  Hi-Mobiler managed it, with this charger they sent me for evaluation and review.<br /><br />First, it's a &#34;smart&#34; charger, meaning that when you plug a device into it, it somehow 'reads' it to learn what the highest amperage it can handle is, then feeds it just that much power.  I have an iPhone 6 and an Android tablet (and a Kindle, and...), and on multiple-port chargers I can never remember which end of the charger has the 1.0mAh port and which end is the 2.0mAh... and they're labeled in print too fine to be read without pulling the thing out of the cigarette lighter (oops-- &#34;power port&#34;) and holding it up under the light.  It's a pain in the backside unalleviated by heated car seats.<br /><br />The ports on the Hi-Mobiler are each labelled 2.4, which is higher than even Apple products require.  With this charger, though, the labels are just decorative-- plug your device into any of the ports and the Smart Charger will simply charge it, at whatever amperage for which the device is rated.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />[I was offered this charger at no cost in exchange for a fair and honest review.]"
"Fast, cheap and worth every penny. It's light and thin as well with decent battery life.<br /><br />I give it three stars because:<br />1) A recent update caused Wifi connectivity issues. I have to turn my phone off and on multiple times a day because wifi will stop detecting all networks.<br />2) The 3.5mm audio jack (headphones/aux) is very quiet. I'd say it would need to be boosted by at least 30% in order to match other phones. This is regardless of which music app, which pair of headphones and which device I'm plugging it in through an aux cable with. I keep my old Lumia 521 in my car for music.<br />3) Touchscreen goes extremely crazy when sending text messages - for every button I press 4-8 more are pressed. This happens on an off and I have to restart the phone to stop it. This doesn't happen in any other app such as facebook messenger."
another chinese junk.. does not hold charges.. i can not even charge my phone full  for 1 single time... drain out too quick.
"i really enjoy the case, only problem i had was the stand piece comes off easily, within 2weeks of having it came off but otherwise the cover is good to have it."
"this phone is no good ,memory card is all screwed up an other things on it"
"I got mine in the mail, and I've been using it daily. It's fits perfectly on the A/C vent closest to the steering wheel of my tahoe. Great affordable product for quality you can count on. You won't be disappointed."
"will not work on my ipad air. Did not know Apple put a chip in so you would have to buy their product, am very disappointed cause I need a longer cable. I wish you had added iphone etc on page when I ordered."
"As described, good chargers"
"DON'T BUY THIS!! It is very cheap for a reason. It only lasted about a week before part of it broke off on the side, and now a week later a lot more on the side has broken off. It's very thin. Cheap made. Sometimes you do get what you pay for..."
"Ever since the very first Android “smart phone” many years ago, I’ve owned more phones (and tablets) than I can recall. Looking at a few recent phones, I’ve owned Galaxy Note 3 & 4, Galaxy S 4 & 5, LG G2/G3/G4, Nokia 1520, Xperia Z Ultra (6.45”), and my current daily driver, the Google Nexus 6 (5.96”). Needless to say, I’m familiar with many models, big & small. :) So let’s take that experience and see how the latest low budget phone from Blu fares.  PROS:  + Excellent value as a phone and/or tablet + Nice looking 7” IPS Display + Very bright screen + Nearly stock Android Lollipop 5.0 + Great Battery Life + Smooth UI Performance + Expandable Storage + Decent build quality + Comfortable to hold, despite it’s size + Looks more expensive than it is + Factory Unlocked for GSM  CONS:  - Low resolution cameras & no flash - Mediocre sounding single speaker & voice quality - Display only 600x1024 (169 ppi) - Limited band support (i.e. no LTE) - Some light bleed - Loose Power/Volume Buttons - No accessories at launch  SPECS:  Since this listing excludes a few important details, I’ll note them here:  * 7” IPS+ 600x1024 (169 ppi) Display * 1.3GHz MediaTek MT8382 Quad-Core CPU w/ MALI 400 GPU * 8GB Internal memory / 1GB RAM / MicroSD storage expandable up to 64GB * 5MP Front & VGA Rear Camera (No Flash) * HSPA + 21Mbps / 3G (aka 4G) Band Support Only- No LTE anywhere * 3450mAh Non-Removable Battery * Full-Size SIM Required for GSM Voice/Data (i.e. T-Mobile/AT&T) * NOT compatible with CDMA Carriers (i.e. Sprint/Verizon) * Includes Headphones, Screen Protector, 2 Amp Charger, and 3ft Cable  DESIGN  For the first time, I’m almost comfortable using the word “phablet” to describe this device. It’s got the screen of a traditional tablet, yet has full voice/data functionality in a slimmed down package. I’m going to just call it a big phone.  First, let’s briefly talk about it’s size. This is a big phone, easily dwarfing my 6” Nexus 6. But it’salso a really small tablet. Compared to a Nexus 7, it’s noticeably smaller in every dimension. While you won’t be doing a lot of one-handed use, it’s still compact enough to fit in the pockets of my less-tight fitting pants. That's as far I'll on about size; it is what it is!  The phone has a mostly plastic construction, with bezels that look like they are higher quality than they are. The back has a nice rubberized texture that makes for a nice place to hold. You’ve got a front ear piece that doubles as the single mono speaker. Interestingly, the headphone and mico-USB port are on the top.  Power and volume rocker switch are on the right side, towards the top. They feel a bit loose and have some play to them. And the micro-SD and Full-Size SIM card slot are covered by a door that requires a tiny flat-head screwdriver to remove. Tool included. And yes, I did say good ‘ol Full Size SIM card. You can buy adapters.  While the textures and coloring won’t fool you into thinking this phone is made of high quality metals, it still looks nice. And the phone has a good solid feel. If you give it a firm twist, there is some expected flex. But no noises… yet.  PERFORMANCE  As you can see from the specs, this phone has a MediaTek SoC with Mali 400 GPU. This CPU is based on the ARM A7 architecture, most commonly associated with the Snapdragon 400, and used with some Octa Core variants. So yes, this is rather dated technology, except do note this is a Quad Core CPU. Not dual core as the original A7’s. It also has the benefit of running cool and being thrifty with power usage. We’ll discuss more on battery life later.  That’s all great, but how does it perform? Thanks to a nearly stock Lollipop 5.0 OS, it runs pretty darn good. Within the UI, things are smooth, fluid, and little-to-no lag/stutter is noticeable there. However, when you start opening/switching apps, the slower CPU & limited memory will make itself known. That’s simply unavoidable with these specs. With that said, it’s still relatively minor, and overall, runs better than expected.  BENCHMARKS & GAMING  While I prefer to focus on real-world performance and don’t usually put much weight behind synthetic benchmarks, here are a few anyways:  3DMark Ice Storm Extreme: 1922 AnTuTu Benchmark v5.7.1: 19590 Geekbench 3 - Single Core: 363 / Multi-Core: 1196  Not the best numbers, but how do games run? So far, they’ve all run just fine. Most games will lower details and resolution to keep them running smooth. As a result, you may see some grainy video or more pixels than you’re used to for high-end titles. Also, because this is a “less common” MediaTek processor, you could run into issues where a game isn’t compatible (i.e. SimCity BuildIt).  Temple Run, for example, ran great. Noticed some grainy images at the title screen, but that’s it. Asphalt 8 also ran smooth & was easy to control, but it’s much more obvious the details have been pushed way down.  OS & FEATURES  As noted above, we are looking at a nearly stock Android 5.0 Lollipop OS. It’s currently still only 5.0, it says it’s upgradable, but no word on when that will actually happen. Of course, just being 5.0 is good enough for now. In particular as there is very little bloatware installed.  You’ve got some Amazon stuff you’ll need to hide, they’ve got Opera, an FM Radio, Google Apps, BLU Help app, and not much else. The OS provides some audio profiles, reboot/airplane mode when pressing the power button, and you can even scheduled power on/off via the Settings menu.  They do include the TouchPal keyboard as default. This one is somewhat new to me, although I’m already finding it’s auto-correct to be surprisingly aggressive and incorrect many times. No worries though. It’s easy to disable.  DISPLAY  After using so many Quad HD IPS and OLED displays, it’s a bit noticeable when jumping down to a lower resolution display. In particular, this 7” IPS+ 600x1024 screen. However, it’s not as bad as it sounds. First, this is an IPS display. The colors are nice and vibrant. Black levels won’t blow you away, but they’re pretty good.  As with many LCD’s these day, the white balance is way on the cool side, which can appear as a light blue tint. Light bleed, while minor, is certainly noticeable. In particular when watching movies with a black background, in a darker room. Viewing angles are acceptable. Very little color shift; you’re mostly going to deal with notable dimming as you view off center.  Brightness is way up there. Indoors I rarely needed to go past 30-40%. Which is actual brightness, since there is no pesky ambient light sensor that I need to turn off. Although I do wish it got dimmer. In a completely dark room, sometimes I found it to be a little brighter than I’d like even at the lowest setting.  Back to the low resolution. How does it really look? In daily use, it actually looks just fine. The only situation it’s really an issue is when you try to look at a full desktop website in portrait mode. It’s here where tiny text and some images can look a blurry. You can of course zoom in, switch to landscape, or stick with mobile versions of websites.  Otherwise reading documents, flipboard, & e-books all look great and are quite pleasant to read on a larger screen.  CAMERA  We’ll keep this one short. It’s a 5MP rear camera and VGA (640x480) on the front. There is no flash. Basically, quality isn’t great for either one of these. Even with good lighting, the images will appear soft, grainy, and noticeably low detail. Clearly this was one area that took the biggest hit to keep the cost so low.  BATTERY  For a large 7” phone, a 3450mAh battery sounds like it would be on the small side. And if this had a ton of pixels and super fast SoC to push, it would be. But a low resolution screen combined with a very energy efficient CPU, and it’s really not that at all. So there’s your upside to low specs!   In my testing, I was able to achieve 7 hours 22 minutes of Screen-On Time, with about 12% battery life remaining. That was with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS all enabled. Screen at about 40%, which could have gone lower for indoor use, but I decided to keep it bright.  There was lots of web surfing, reading flipboard, and well over an hour of video playback with both YouTube and MXPlayer, each. Charging was also quick, getting up to nearly half capacity within about an hour or so.  Once again, your results will absolutely vary.  SOUND & VOICE  Interestingly, this phone shares the ear-piece for main speaker use. That speaker grill you see on the front/top of the phone is the only speaker on this device. Yes, it’s the same one used for voice calls. The mic is way at the bottom.  The speaker sadly doesn’t get very loud, sounds tiny at higher volumes, and doesn’t have much detail. It’s simply adequate. Given it’s movie watching aspirations, I really do wish it had another speaker at the bottom for stereo.  The microphone also isn’t the best quality. Test calls resulted in the same mediocre ear-piece sound quality and on the other end, my voice was slightly distorted or muffled at times. Even if I got closer to the microphone, it didn’t change all that much. Although both parties were still able to hear each other and carry on a conversation.  MISSING HARDWARE & BAND SUPPORT  You’re already expecting a few things to get cut when trying to hit a low price point on a big phone. So what are some notable items I haven’t already discussed? First, there is only 802.11n 2.4GHz support for WiFi. No 5Ghz or AC support. It’s still plenty fast, hitting over 40mbps on my router; it won’t break any records.  No NFC. But we do still have GPS & Bluetooth of course. No notification light. No camera flash. With only 8GB of internal storage & 1GB of RAM, you could run into some limitations. Although for memory, that usually just means apps won't stay cached in memory as long, and may take longer to open than usual. And with low storage you'll want to keep as much on the MicroSD card as you can. You've already lost around 2.5GB in system data alone. Most apps are getting updated to support SD card installation. Plus, there is an option in Settings to change the &#34;default&#34; storage location. Once again, up to the app to cooperate.  And as noted in specs, there are only a few GSM bands for HSPA+ 21 / 3G. Also commonly referred to as 4G by some carriers. That’s also the slower HSPA+ connection. Which on AT&T in the Austin, TX area, meant around 4Mbps down & a little over 1Mpbs up. Your results will vary. It’s not blazing, but it will do for most internet tasks.  To clarify, there is no LTE support on either the Global or US (my phone) variant. And will only work with a GSM carrier, such as AT&T or T-Mobile.  CONCLUSION  The Blu Studio 7.0 II fits into what may seem like an odd category for many folks, in certain regions. But for others, it makes perfect sense to combine your tablet & phone needs into one cost effective gadget. If you’re able to comfortably carry around such a large phone and don’t have a need for high-end (or mid-range) specs, I think you’ll be very satisfied with this one.  Bottom line, it has most of the important features needed to keep it useful and they didn’t get too carried away on the budget cutting board. Although with that said, I’d love to see what Blu could do in a higher-end category. If they even simply upgraded to a 1080p display, faster SoC, decent stereo speakers, and keep a fair price, it would be impressive.  In either case, all things considered, this one is definitely recommended."
"Provides good charge times but the way the prongs are positioned means it can take up an extra socket if you're using it on a surge protector like I am. Other than that, it's OEM-like in quality for a fraction of the cost."
Solid quality. Feels a lot more expensive than the $10 it costs. Completely charges a iPhone 6 Plus or a Galaxy Note 5 without dying.
"The case itself does not fit the phone, thus disabling the use of the silent switch on the top left edge of the phone. The finishing around the edges of the aluminum face is of poor quality and the case itself looked used. On the packaging it states that it comes with a leather lanyard and that it is made in the U.S.A., but the lanyard was neither leather nor was the product made in the U.S.A. After further research the product was produced in the China. Overall, poor quality and false advisement."
"This case was very pretty and very functional.  It seemed to be very well made.  However the first night I got it,  I had to take my phone out of the case to charge it.  I was very disappointed in that.  I tried all three chargers and it would not charged in the case.  Had I been able to charge my phone while it was in the case I would of kept it.  Unfortunately I could not so I had to send it back."
it broke within a week of purchasing.  Total garbage!
I love my Tempe for camping trips. Hook this up to your backpack or hang it outside / in the tent / wherever and you'll get much more accurate temperature logs than you do with a watch on your wrist. If your very interested in tracking temperature while out in the wild and still want to huddle down in your sleeping bag while you check the temperature outside this is worth it.
"I LIVE WAY OUT IN A METAL CLAD HOME. SINCE ADDING THE SIGNAL BOOSTER TO MY HOME AND ONE FOR MY CAR, I JUST DON'T DROP CALLS"
"Great sound, and easy to install.  The quality was top notch for the price.  I wish I would have stuck to my JL's sooner..."
I really like this case. It fit my phone really well and looks really cute too. I've already dropped it a couple of times and it helped keep my phone from getting scratched or breaking. Defiantly worth the money i paid.
"Fantastic.  These have good range, come in variety of different colors, and come with a convenient key chain tag.  I use them with Tasker / Trigger app combination on my android device.  Love how efficient my device has become because of them!  Turns menial, sometimes-tedious, tasks into an even simpler tap of your device."
I bought this a few months ago and it still looks pretty good thank you muah!
"Great case. Protects the phone well, even the corners. Has enough of a lip to really make a difference while still remaining thin and durable. Nice product."
"Great case.  It fit's perfectly and is really sturdy.  Love the kick stand, it makes it convenient for watching."
I have always loved these Incipio cases because I feel they give the most protection to the phone! This case seems to wear down very quickly and I end up buying a new one every other month because of how beat up they end up looking; But I would rather pay for a new case than a new phone
"I initially bought this for a road trip this summer and it was amazing.  We do have an outlet to plug it into in our truck so I could charge both our phones, both our iPads and both of our motorcycle Scala Rider headsets all at the same time!!!  It was perfect.  Now I am using it at my desk.  It really streamlines all the devices I need to charge and makes it less messy and more organized.  Fantastic!! Thank you!!"
"Purchased for the GPS for vacation to the Northwest and used the GPS in Seattle, Mt. Rainier, Olympic National Park, Victoria BC, and Vancouver. We are very happy with this GPS. The directions are very accurate and the traffic alerts are very helpful. When there is traffic ahead, the traffic alert will notify about the traffic and potential alternate route. Got updated maps from Magellan and it took about 20 to 30 minutes to update the map.  Minor complaint is that the GPS unit connects to the satellite a little slow when the power is turned on. So you will have to wait a bit to get signal."
"JOTO's waterproof case does everything as described! It's a such relief not to have to worry about my iPhone 6+, just enjoy it! Used my JOTO on the water this weekend (I'm 73 & love kayaking). My JOTO is easy & simple to use (important when dexterity lessens!) and I got just as clear pictures as when it's not in the JOTO."
I bought this in order to arrange the cables in the office. Solid performance. Exterior finish was great. I want to buy one more for my family.
scratches too easily . I'm on my second in two months and I'm not a over user.
"Well, I started out loving this product.  It charged my phone in warp speed.  Awesome, right?!  Then, the 3rd day I had it, it was plugged in and my phone fell off the counter.  The plug part pulled as it fell since the cord wasn't quite long enough to reach the ground.  Well, the whole thing came apart!  I mean it plug into the phone just kind of disintegrated - it was the weirdest thing ever!  I had to use plyers to get out the last piece of the plug that got stuck in my phone when it came apart.  Very disappointed."
"I expected silicone but instead I got a hard snap on case , and the description said silicone 😒 I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was a hard case"
"So far its been excellent! It came on time, the specs on the phone Internal storage 4.75GB, Built in storage 9.79GB and the 16GB SD card mounted. It responds to the touch. I love this phone so far!"
"This works very well, for only $13 it works great to play my music while driving through the city."
Super handy and light weight. This is great for outdoors use and camping and survival. A must to have in a bug out bag or disaster box. It is covered in a rubber like skin and has rubber plug covers that protect the usb ports from water. It has 2 usb ports to change two items at one time. It can be charged up with an external usb2 power supply or by it's built in solar panel.  It has a D ring included that allows you to hang it off the side of a tent or wall facing the sun so it can charge up. It's water proof so even if it rains when you leave it out for charging it wont be ruined. This solar charger is about the size of a large smart phone and a little thicker. I bought mine at a discount for an honest and fair review. I would say no different about this at it current price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) Solar power portable.<br />2.) Water proof<br />3.) Rubber guard skin<br />4.) Portable and pack-able.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) Not enough power to charge my ipad. It will charge all phones and some tablets.<br /><br />Pics:
"To be upfront about this, I did receive this case for free in order to write a review.  That does not change nor influence my opinion on this product.<br /><br />Really enjoying this new case. Prior to this, I had been using an OB case. While I love the protection that case offers, it tends to allow dust under the screen protector. I usually have the phone in my pocket, so dust can occur quite easily. So far I have not experienced dust under the screen protector.  The screen protector does not have the same 'trampoline' feel that the OB case has.<br /><br />Getting the hard shell off the softer part of the case was not the easiest thing to do, but it was not challenging. This is to ensure a good, solid fit, and it really helps ensure that this is a high-quality and secure case.<br /><br />I really like that there are included the three different colored back pieces.  I would, however, like to see the colors match the color of the iPhone itself.  I have the gold color and the colors are close, but do not match.  Since there's the hole in the back to display the Apple logo, you can see the color difference.  I cannot comment on the two other colors and how they compare.  I don't actually care about this, and it does not detract from the quality of the product at all.<br /><br />When changing the back piece, there may need to be a little extra 'attention' to getting all the edges flush, but with minor effort, it's no problem.  Again, the little extra bit of work pays off in that the edges are solid and tight and help ensure that there's less gap for debris to get in.<br /><br />The flaps that cover the slots are easy to open and close.  If I had to mention a detraction it would be that the cover for the headphone slot can occasionally be a little tricky to get re-seated, but it does go in.  Just might take a little attention and not something you can do mindlessly.<br /><br />I will be keeping my phone in this case.  It's great."
"Base on other reviews I was not sure about the product; yet I am glad to have made the purchase. The case is incredibly resistant, and it also looks well made."
Works as intended and doesn't feel like it is going to break.<br /><br />I can't use it on my car's air vents because this is too heavy for them. Sucks for me but not the product's fault.
"I love this player as a great accompaniment to my Nokia Lumia 1020. It charges perfectly, connects easy, and has great sound. Definite fan of this product for sure."
"This is my first time using a glass screen protector for my phone and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />I opened it up and found a nice thick piece of glass that is free from any scratches or dust. I was able to get it installed on my phone quickly and easily, since the cleansing and drying cloths are already included in the package I had everything I would need.<br /><br />Once I got the screen protector on, I loved the fact that it is crystal clear and it didn't even look like I had added anything to my phone.There were no bubbles and I could still use my touch screen just like before. I really like knowing that I have the added protection now in case of bumps or drops. I received one to review and I can say with 100% certainty that it DOES WORK. Unfortunately for me, I dropped my phone shortly after putting the screen protector on. Luckily for me, thanks to this screen protector, my phone was completely unharmed. Very glad to have it!"
"Outstanding item.  I've bought 2.<br /><br />If you have a phone case, you can easily adhere the (thin) metal plate to the inside of the case, if you are worried about applying it directly to your phone.  The magnet (that clips to your air vent) is strong enough to make it through your case.  I have a semi-thick plastic case on mine and it works great enough to hold the phone in either straight-up or landscape, without problem.  In addition, in straight-up position, the magnet is strong enough to hold the phone while plugged in for charging as well.  I use it in my car and carry an extra magnet in my bag for travel (for rental cars).  Works so well.<br /><br />Would only suggest not to use this if you keep your credit cards in your phone case, for obvious (magnetic) reasons.  But if you do not use your phone case for storage of your CC's.... this is an awesome product."
"Even though it's rubber and flexible, it fits like a glove and protects the iPod!"
Mines stop working in a week
These are clearly not worth the list price (before markdown) but for super cheap they are great.
"Great cover, dropped my phone from around 3ft 3 times so far and not a single problem.  All buttons and holes line up perfectly with 100% of screen viewable.  Backing has minor gripping compared to all metal or plastic cases."
Cheaply made rubber like outer covering. Would prefer the thicker PVC vinyl covering which is smooth and easier to handle.<br />Will not re-order.
My son has a Lg Optimus.<br />He is always dropping his phone and has has even got a small chip on the corner of the glass.<br />I purchased this for him to put his phone in so that it will be well protected and easy for him to use.<br />He has no problem accessing any features of his phone now.<br />This case is light weight and i love that it has a viewing window on the front of the cover so you can see the clock or notifications.<br />It is stylish and he loves it.<br />His phone now is safe and sound against drops .<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. However I don't just give glowing reviews to a product just because i received it free or a discount. If my review helped you in any way please click
"If all you plan to take with you is a credit card and ID, this is a great little carry case.  If you are hoping to use it to carry cash as well, don't expect to carry much or closing this will be difficult.  It does hold the phone securely and I was able to take photos with no problem.  It worked for what I needed it for which was something small to carry on vacation, however I did use a little bigger purse to carry my extra cash, cards & essentials.  For now it's back in the closet, will re-access later."
"Extremely well designed case, as expected from BlackBerry.<br />Useful, elegant, protects well the phone. Real leather. I do recommend it."
I ordered these by mistake. They get caught in my hair and come off easily.
The case is excellent and just like the supcase one I was replacing.  Unfortunately the HOT PINK looks more red to me than pink.  I should have ordered the white as I started to do.
"bought this as part of my husbands birthday gift and it arrived on time, product is great...you can change colors to match with your clothes."
My daughter loves this selfie stick.  She had purchased a much cheaper one and it did not work very well.  This selfie stick has a solid feel and seems very sturdy.  The clamps appear very secure.  The blue tooth paired with her iPhone very easily and quickly.
For the price and quality this is the best but I have found for a glass screen protector! I will buy more and recommend this product. It also comes with cleaning wipes and tape to take the lint off before applying the screen protector
"It fits my Apple Sports watch so much! I actually like the look of this more than the original Apple Watch Space Grey with the Steel Band and that costs $1200 after tax! This band is really well made , very comfortable and looks so much nicer . I love the stitching detail."
"It fits the phone well and the rubber sides do not easily bend back - I have the clear one which is actually a little bit different model than the colored ones. However, after several weeks the sides turned a brownish color, which is not very attractive. After about 6 months it bothered me too much and I purchased a different case (leather one from Apple - love it). Also, the back is not scratch resistant like it says - it is plastic after all so I never expected it to resist scratches. Overall, the case protects well, especially for the price. But if you get the all clear just know it will change over time."
This battery was not an original Samsung and caused the phone to turn off and on sporadically. I could not use it.
This is an all around win win situation! My order arrived on time as promised. Extremely easy to apply. No glare or distortions. So relieved that my phones screen is now protected. I have recommended the Pleson tempered glass screen proctor to my friends.
"Great battery.  The unit charges 4 usb items at once.  It's been great to keep both my phones, Ipod, and any other device I need to top off charged while in airports or on planes, or in business meetings where power is unavailable.<br /><br />Great customer service.  15 months into use, the unit still held a charge, however it would not output power to my devices.  Emailed Anker with the issue, and they are sending a replacement free of charge.  Thanks Anker!"
I order this for my boss to find different jobs. He liked it so much I oder anther one for his other truck.
"HORRIBLE,  waited an insane amount of time and the tablet doesn't even stay in. It's loose and very poorly made! The Stylus cushion fell off within days! Definitely got what we paid for!"
Product is exactly as described. It fits the watch perfectly and looks great.
"I love how adjustable this is, and it seems like it would be very secure, as other reviewers note ... if I could get the thing to latch properly. The first time I tried to lower the lever in the back to anchor it down, the lever popped off, and I couldn't get it to work at all. After fussing with it a lot for about a week, it finally randomly stuck, and I was not about to mess with it!<br /><br />I used it happily for over a month and loved it, but then it just popped off again - I didn't hit a bump, touch it, or anything, it just let go, sending my phone for a ride while I was driving. I can't get it back on for the life of me.<br /><br />So I took a closer look at each piece, and it turns out that the latch looks defective. The plastic parts that should poke into the little holes of the stand, anchoring the joint in place, are warped and useless. One side is just straight, flush with the rest of the part, and so doesn't do anything, and the other side looks like it was melted and bent inward, resulting in a bulge way too big to fit in the hole. I have no idea how this thing held on for a month, and don't expect it to again.<br /><br />It seems like an awesome product, but I'm disappointed with the defective workmanship. I'd still consider another one."
Dad loved it
"Great looking ,durable case. I bought one for myself then a second for my daughter after really liking mine.<br />Fast service.<br />Would do business with them again."
"This case was so easy to put on my cell phone, fits like a glove. I have only had this cell phone case for a month but, I would have no problems recommending this cell phone case to anyone."
"the inner plastic shell snaps on really tight and the outer rubber gives it a good grip. Unfortunately, the bottom charging port cover doesn't align quite right with the phone and the top headphone jack cover is starting to tear after just a couple uses."
Love it! Great fit -a gel case not a plastic case like I thought.
"Should have listened to the poor reviews on this item. Did not work from the first attempt. Dont waste your time or money, please."
Husband loves if.
"Nice phone.Amazing long life battery and sweet custom os color, white and orange, looks cool.<br />It's will be 5 starts if Blu developer team update phone to Lollipop as they promise in june."
"tiny metal ring where the lanyard clips onto has already come off, and a bit of color is fading, but otherwise decently made."
I received a discount on my order for a fair review and this is one of  the best car chargers I had thus far. I am normally picky about what chargers I purchase but this one charges my phone really fast. I don't really have time to charge my phone from the time I get in the car till the time I get out. I recommend this charger to anyone that needs to go from 0 to 100 really quickly.
Wonderful case except in putting in on one day I broke a clip off and now it's hard to keep case shut.
I think I've finally found the place where I'll order all chargers from now on.  Really nice product!
has no button to take the picture sucks
item received broken.
I ordered mine and it has a sharp ring to it when I connect my phone to it and it won't stop no matter what station I set it too
The sound is clear and it performs as well as any other name brand device.
"The car mount is made well and holds my phone (iPhone 6) firmly. But, the ball which allows 360 rotation caused the phone to be too far away from the vent grip. After a while, due to the weight of the phone it leans forward. I would say overall a good product which does the job."
"Great case fpr me.  Most of the time I carry my phone in my pocket and the aluminum is light, thin and protective.  Perfect."
This is my 2 koolkase and I absolutely love them! They fit my phone perfect and look exactly like the picture! I won't use anything else from now on.
"This is a great little stereo kit. I put this setup in a cooler for a float trip and now I will have to order more because several people I know want me to make them on.  Pros: - Kit includes everything you need to wire up the amp and speakers, plus has an aux hookup for phones, iPods, etc. - Speakers are decently loud and clear. As long as you don't play bass heavy music and have the volume cranked to max, these little speakers sound decent. - The amp is really small so it can fit in tight places (such as a cooler), or on an ATV or motorcycle.  Cons: - The volume knob it comes with is not very good. If you barely touch it the volume goes up drastically. Also a normal knob would increase gradually from 8 oclock to 4 oclock with 8 being off and 4 being maxed out. This knob maxes out around 11 oclock and the rest of the way does nothing. It doesn't get louder. This isn't a huge deal, just something I wanted to point out to people. - The waterproof bag that is meant to hold a cellphone or iPod is pretty small. Any modern cellphone in a case will probably not fit in the bag. You will have to remove the case most likely. My Galaxy S4 in a case wouldn't fit in the bag unfortunately.  Summary: This is a great kit for the money. If you are expecting super loud music that is as clear as a concert you are looking at the wrong product. I would like to remind everybody that the speakers are about $10 a piece and you truly do get what you pay for. I do believe that most people will enjoy this product if they keep in mind just how cheap it is. This kit works great for someone looking for some music in their boat, atv, or cooler. If you need something cheap, that doesn't sound too bad and is decently loud; go ahead and get this product. You won't be disappointed."
"Nice, rugged case, but the rubber is a little too grippy, so I found it to be a little too hard to get in and out of the holster.  Sure, you don't want it to fall out, but it should be a little easier to get out."
This works perfectly.  Holds your phone securely.
"I've never owned a selfie stick honestly, so this is the first one actually but I will say this much, the photobomb selfie stick is really convienant for me to use, there's no extra wires attached to get in the way. And the photobomb selfie stick completely supports my iphone when in place so in not worried about my phone falling and getting damaged because it's securely held into place using padding to so now scratches occur while placing it into the selfie stick. I totally love the photobomb selfie stick and will be using this everyday. I also highly reccomend purchasing one if you haven't already, not only is this a great item I got it for an unbeatable price with the exchange of a review and last but not least the shipping was super fast. Thanks"
"Stylish and comes with an ink pen inside which is great for those at the moment, quickies or to sign a check, but who does that anymore? Anyway, you have to give a firm push when using this stylus. It doesn't sense the pen or rather the screen fast as I'd like it to...like the note4 phone. But it looks good and matches my<br /> Pwr+ Silver Metal Pivoting Flex Ipad Stand Holder."
"I got this free for testing and review purposes ,  I really like it High quality"
"Came quickly, good quality and husband likes a lot.  Thanks Cell-Nerds!"
It's great the have a 90 degree cable. I love it!
"I was a bit worried when ordering this as I read some of the comments stating this case did not fit properly. There were also comments stating the back of the phone needed to be removed in order for the case to fit properly. I found neither of these statements to be true.<br /><br />The case fit snugly with the original back on the phone and all buttons worked properly. I think the reason for the reviews stating the case did not fit is simply that this case is for the 1st generation Moto E released in 2014. If you are unsure which case you have, you should check your model number to be certain before ordering.<br /><br />I am 100% satisfied, and received my case one day earlier that expected. Would recommend to anyone with a 1st generation Moto E that needs more than just a soft silicon case to protect against drops."
"Worked well, easy to install and does protect screen. You do have to wipe down the protector a lot."
I like the service it's fast<br />And the products are awesome prices can't ask for less<br />It's the first time I buy from amazon<br />I love it
"This case is very well made and designed fitting the phone beautifully. This case offers a very high level of protection for both phone and screen from water as well as dust, dirt or accidental damage. The case is both easy to fit and remove. When fitted you are still able to utilize all buttons and ports- afterwards just ensure to properly fit the protective seals so that the case remains waterproof.Overall this is a very well made and designed case which is both easy to fit and remove. The case provides a very high level of protection from water as well as dust, dirt and accidental damage. Highly recommend."
"did not like them, every time I plugged it into my nav system a message came across that it was not charging so I sent them back"
"My daughter loves this case! It shipped fast, it's cute and is sturdy so it will protect her phone from normal teenage life. the price was outstanding considering how durable the case is!"
Does not work.  Can't change the channel.  I am sending it back.
"The back is not that great, the glue has already started to detach. I have had the phone a few weeks! Also the battery dies constantly. As a matter of fact as of this moment .....the phone will not turn on at all...I have no idea why! I tried to take the back off and that too is a pain! I would not purchase this phone again! I actually would like my money back for this one!!!!!!"
The charger is great in terms of how easy it was to manage multiple devices for more than 1 person on a long international trip.  My only complaint was that the on/off switch stopped functioning about halfway through the trip and I had to unplug it from the wall whenever I wanted to turn it off.
This case broke in less than a week. The only reason for giving it two stars was the team design on back was pretty cool.
I had a little feedback on the phones that I ship to members of the family and this phone was very very good they loved it no bad complain Thanks
"This is an absolutely gorgeous case. My hubby has been whinging about having a hard time finding a cool case for his LG, and this one fit the bill. He likes that he can get it in a color besides black ( I picked out the blue for him). You don't have to put this on your phone as a whole new case, your phone just pops right in. It's sturdy and withstands some pretty bad drops- he's a klutz- it went down the stairs last night and his phone is just fine. LG's have the most dainty little screens- they will shatter if you look at them funny, so that was pretty impressive. It sticks to his magnetic car mount and will stay open if you want to use it as a kickstand. The quick circle opening is great, you don't have to open the case when you want to check the time or see who's calling. It also has a handy dandy slot for your ID or credit card so you can take just the necessities when exercising or walking the dog or whatevs.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount necessary to facilitate my honest review. No other forms of payment were or will be received."
"Ive had this charger for over a year, it is very durable. It is starting to get bent by the charger part (from over use), it still works, though!"
"I'm very pleased with this little subwoofer solution.  I needed something that would be compact and out of the way, plus I really just wanted a little bit of bass to round out my listening experience.  This seemed to be a really good fit for my criteria and the price was definitely right.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the sound could be better.  The response could be a bit tighter, it's a little flubby or loose in the low end.  All things considered, though, I'm still very impressed with it.  It's plenty loud and it really brings out the punch in a kick drum, which is mainly what I wanted.  Just make sure you take some time to mess around with the settings (don't forget about the settings in your cd player!) to find the optimal sound for you.<br /><br />Also, I purchased the BOSS Audio KIT2 8 Gauge Amplifier Installation Kit which provided me with everything I needed (and more) to get my subwoofer set up.  Set up was easy enough that I was able to take some tools to work the day that it arrived and install it at the park.  I've been using this for over a month now and I would recommend this to someone who just wants a tasteful amount of sub-frequencies in a small foot print."
Lost my charger for the shuffle. This came in just 2 days and did the trick. You gotta love prime.
I purchased this battery replacement for my nephew as he is no longer able to charge his phone through a cable and relies on charging batteries outside of the phone and switching them out.<br />For the price and fact it's a Samsung battery it's a great deal. I haven't heard any complaints from him on it not working in a month.
"Decent case... I've had this a couple time... they last me 4-6 months.  There is a button on the top, and the opening for the button makes the case weak in that area... It eventually cracks and I have to replace the case.  I've bought cases from other manufacturers as well, and the problem seems to be more with the design of the phone than the case."
Looks great on the phone and was a good price. Seems fairly protective. However I do believe that it adds a bit too much weight and bulk to the phone. I'm considering looking for another product.
"Seems too wide to slide in the side of my Samsung GT-N5110; otherwise, it works fine."
"Durability is bad. My screen spider webbed 2 days after having it. Do not remember ever hitting it on anything. So it was lightly tapped or had pressure on it. I contacted the seller. they said they would fix screen for 30$. While nice they offered to fix, 30$ every 2 days is not my cup of tea. But, while it did work, well after the bt notification setup with no instruction. Looked at youtube video. I did like the watch. Liked that my wrist vibrated and I could see who is calling. My phone does not come out of my pocket easy so I loved this. could respond to txt also. really liked it. I would use this and support it if it did not break so easy. BTW if it spider webs. you can no longer use it, touch screen does not work. had to take battery out to shut it off.<br />so my 2 stars is solely on durability, well and screen size was a little bulky. but that is a touch screen, could get used to that. I personally would like a smaller, not much, just a litter smaller screen, just to see who is calling, texting and such. thats just my preference"
Nice product works great. It fits my phone perfectly and the color is just the way it looks. Love it!
"Really great case, i've already had a couple close calls and its saved my phone every time. The built in screen protector is responsive as well. The case looks great and does its job perfectly."
"It works with my samsung, only thing is it falls if I do jumping jacks. I will only use for office, since i hate getting up and drop my phone! lol Why 3 stars? It falls off my ear, it's annoying."
Used it hiking over the summer. No problem charging my phone and other items. Wish they had changed the placement of the grommets so that the pouch could be shielded from the sun by the 1st solar panel. Still gets 5 stars.
"I like the way it feels in my hand, and the protection it gives my phone, it's what I need. Also I had a outterbox before this case and that thing was huge, but now that I have this case it's sleek and perfect"
"Simple design works well and clips your phone quickly and easily. Despite what some have said, it does swivel to hold a phone vertically which is how I use it, so I can see more of the route ahead of me.<br /><br />Update: I liked the product functionality initially, but after 2 years, both units I ordered have failed...the first one failed in the first year and the other one in the second year. The plastic just breaks apart and the rotating portion separates from the base and it's useless."
"The card sleeves are a little bit tight. Can't fit much more than ID, CC and one or two more cards, but the whole point of the purchase for me was to slim down my wallet, so I'm not complaining. The magnet that secures the iphone case to the wallet portion is really strong and reliable (after two weeks of use). Overall, great value, and I would recommend it."
"I just got my Otterbox Commuter case for my iPhone 6+, and I'm very happy with it. The case is strong and sturdy, and I know my case is protected. One little thing I didn't like is the fact that I couldn't keep my tempered glass screen protector, and had to use the one they provided with it because the glass protector makes the phone thicker by a sliver, therefore making it hard to insert the phone in. This case does not have a installed screen protector like the Defender series but like I said they provide a screen protector that comes layers with two guide films to set it in place. I'm so glad I got this case because not only is thin unlike the Defender, but it's sturdy enough to protect the phone from bumps, drops, dust and scratches. I highly recommend this case, and I'm glad I ordered it. The seller is super fast in shipping the items, and the quality and workmanship of each product is epic. The cases are 100% genuine Otterbox, and they come in original retail packaging. This is really an amazing Otterbox case to enjoy and be proud of. Thank you. :-)"
"This is the perfect case for my Galaxy S5.  I have had it for a few months and the case has not had any discoloration.  I like the fit and the sturdiness.  I have dropped my phone a few times, face down on hard surfaces.  So far, the case has protected my Galaxy.  I would purchase again."
"I grabbed these based on the price and some reviews. However, I had fairly low expectations based on past purchases of several brands of stylus.<br />What a great surprise- these styli are solid, a nice length, and write nicely. Despite being a little thinner than I expected, they have a decent heft.<br />They stylus end seems a little flimsy but works just fine. Personally, I prefer this design (stylus on one end, pen on the other) to the 'penpoint-through-the-stylus' style. All in all, a very satisfactory product and deal."
Lot's of positive compliments on the design.  The case is also sturdy enough to take a fall.
"I purchased the MAXX Case from iThrough when my husband and I got new phones. Having previously had covers similar to this, I knew we would like them. We also knew we wanted a kickstand because we had one before & loved it. They are so convenient. The case fits very snugly which is GOOD because I had a case that didn't and eventually it would come off and I'd have to put it back on. I like my case. I had never had a white case before and probably won't get one again simply because it go dirty so quickly. I got the blue one for my husband and his doesn't look dirty at all. I solved the problem by simply taking it off and washing it. Since it is removable, that is fine. The second piece is the black part which is where the kickstand is located. They look to be just as durable as the ones we had before and they lasted longer than the phones.<br /><br />Although I am a product tester / reviewer and test several products each week, I purchased this case on my own without a discount. No matter which way I'm buying products, I always pre-test each item and give my honest & unbiased opinion."
As described and arrived earlier than it said. Great product .
nice product. i highly recommend this to others...
Great price for this charger. Product was as advertised. Works well with my iphone. Fast shipping. I will recommend this charger to my iphone friends Thanks again!
Finally! Someone figured out how to make a true &#34;universal&#34; phone mount. This device uses a clever magnetic system that securely hold your phone in place regardless what kind of phone case you may have.  No double-sided sticky tape on anything like on other mounts.  Simply put they got it right!
It works.  Very simple to setup and to use.  Audio quality is excellent.
"As others will mention, the fittings are backwards. Its fine if you replace all wires otherwise it'll reverse the polarity and sound terrible. I chose to cut and splice back together. A pain for a cheap product, but they worked just fine once swapped."
"Got these, they took quite a while to ship from China. Yes they actually ship directly from China. Out of 10 pieces only 5 will actually stay closed without tape. They are fairly flimsy and very likely will open if you just toss them into a camera bag. The price is cheap and while I'd prefer the type that actually ships with the cards these were the best I could find that weren't crazy priced.<br />Just be aware that they are not very secure and can pop open."
"Seemed more shoddily assembled than the OEM headphones which came with the phone.  Both sides are noticeably loose in the cabling causing lots of rustling noise while in-ear.  Sound quality is fine, just lots of rustling while moving."
"I bought this phone for my 11 year old daughter. It was an add on to my other qualifying purchases so it only cost $5. It's her first cell phone so I thought it would be a good learning experience for her to handle and maintain the cost of her minutes.<br /> She was really excited to receive it. It holds a charge all day and she plugs it in at night. It does the three most important things to her: Text, play music, and make calls. The camera isn't the best quality. After about 2 weeks of use she did say she had difficulty receiving texts from her friends-almost as if they are dropped but the sender (her) was not notified. She doesn't receive some pictures her friends send her but that is to be expected with 3G rather than 4G. After a few drops we've discovered it's pretty sturdy. We've since gotten a case for it.<br />  It's been a great learning tool for her. She monitors her minutes and uses some of her allowance to purchase minutes. For now, it's a great little phone for her and she's pretty happy to have it. I'll upgrade her when she's 13. :)"
I was looking for a protective case for my iPhone 6 for bike rides when it needed a little more protection against bumps than usual.  The phone fits perfectly in this case with its thin case (Belkin Grip Case / Cover for iPhone 6) still on.  It's also very easy to get in and out of the pouch.  Exactly what I wanted.
Great for a portable fish finder. Make sure you use the strap too tie off the excess cable. Mine got caught in the motor propeller. It only came loose one time. I used it on aluminum boats with up to 10 HP motors.
"im surprised by the exceptional quality of this car charger. the included usb cable is also well made. top port is for standard charge. the bottom port provides a faster charge. small, sleek, and works well!"
"UPDATE: enviCAR reached out to me following my initial 1 Star review with genuine concern as to why I was unhappy. They have AMAZING customer support and honestly care about their product and keeping their customers and critics alike, happy. After returning the product and receiving a full refund, enviCAR followed up wanting to know more details as to why I was dissatisfied. As I mentioned in the my original review below, while the design and build quality are sound, they simply do not work with my vehicle. enviCAR generously offered a free mount (which they shipped to me VERY fast) in order to give as a gift to someone with a more favorable vent configuration. Well done enviCAR for truly earning my respect and this 4-Star review. Keep on keeping on.<br /><br />I have a 2013 Tucson and an iPhone 6 with no case for reference. Up front within reach of the driver there are two possible vents to use. When using the one to the left of the steering wheel, the phone sits awkwardly low and his partially obscured by the wheel. There is also no room to rotate the phone to landscape mode. When using the vent to the right of the wheel (which is rounded, not flat) the mount connects but is forced to tilt the face of the phone towards either the wheel or the passenger. The phone also blocks a portion of the ignition button and still does not have room to rotate to landscape mode. The construction and overall design of the mount is solid and packaged well, but it simply does not work with this vehicle. Also, with so few mounts up front, sacrificing a vent in cold weather months to avoid excess heat being applied to your device is not an option."
"You can see the quality and durabilty of this product. A good cable is always important too, it's not just about the charging usb outlet either."
"I bought my Galaxy Fit refurbished from best buy and I love it so much. It does everything I want it to do and some. You've just got to realize it's not the other Samsung smart watch as in you can answer text but only certain phrases that YOU designate. It pauses, skips, and starts music."
Next time i do  better reviews on pruducts like this it pretty much died on me light are very dim cant even see after one day use<br />i was pretty stoked when showed on time for delevery plug it in first 2 hrs charging  bright then died dont waste your money i never buy again waist my money oh well lesson learn  if had - 5 stars that what i gave it i emaild the seller nothing in return yet least try another  cord this one mine did not work just beware if cheap there is reson why to good be true have good day happy shoping i still buy things of amzon one bad pruduct not going stop me have great day sorry for bad review but i had speak so u guys no if sell contact me i let every no
"These are very slick headphones with a lot of verbal feedback for what you are doing at any given time including telling you about caller information if you use them to answer calls, power levels, etc. The instructions are actually pretty poor so it's best that you get this sort of feedback to help you navigate their use more effectively. For the record, the &#34;pairing&#34;/&#34;power&#34; button is the little button in the center with a phone receiver on it. This isn't made clear in the instructions. However, the phone functions are clearly explained.<br /><br />The sound quality is actually very good, though it does vary based on how they are put in your ears. The manual makes it clear that fit affects sound. If you get a good seal, the sound is excellent with good bass and treble. If they're not in properly, the sound will come across as more muted, though certainly not poor by any stretch of the imagination. The high notes are especially rich. Bass was good and not muted, but it may depend on your sound source and type of music. I listened to U2 and it sounded quite good, though the songs weren't especially bassy.<br /><br />The headphones design is slick and elegant and whether or not you like it will depend on how they happen to fit your ears. My ears are average for a woman and they fit me fine. In fact, I liked the fact that they are smooth plastic better than a rubber/silicon ear bud design, but there is no adjustment possible. If they don't fit you, you're out of luck. I wondered if the lack of alternate buds related to the fact that they are waterproof or maybe it is to ensure that people put them in such that the sound quality is good. I would recommend putting the cable behind your head rather than having it hang down in front of you because there is less &#34;pull&#34; on the buds out of your ears. That being said, I tried them both ways and in front didn't cause me any issues even when I shook my head to see if they would fall out.<br /><br />I didn't add up all of the time that I played music through these without recharging and I didn't listen for more than 7 hours continuously, but it didn't seem that recharging was necessary at frequent intervals. I'm sure they'll last long enough for most needs based on my rough estimation. They also seemed to have some noise cancelling effects, likely based on the position they take in your ears.<br /><br />Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.I played music through these without recharging and I didn't listen for more than 7 hours continuously, but it didn't seem that recharging was necessary at frequent intervals.

"The case is snug and pushes the volume button all the way down, so I cant use the item :("
"Good charger for my iPhone!  It hasn't had any problems yet, and I have used it for about a week."
"works as expected with Ipad and iphone. I do like the braided cable, since I have broken 3 of my previous cable due to intensive cabling...."
Love it . This usb matches my phone case. I am glad i ordered it. It works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy 5 sport. Thank you will buy from again in near future.
Grey and blue colors are very stylish and chic.  It gives my Samsung Galaxy phone a sexy new makeover. Cover is very sturdy. Made with durable materials which protect my phone from falls and other elements.  Case arrived with a hand held mirror in the storage compartment. You can store a credit/debit card or even an ID with the mirror or remove the mirror and store 2 cards.<br /><br />I purchased this case when I travelled out of the country so I can store my card in an inconspicuous yet safe location. I would highly recommend this product!
"Installation was easy, with clear instructions, cleaning cloth and alcohol swabs provided with the screen.<br />My phone's original screen was prone to finger prints and smudges and was difficult to clean.<br />With this glass screen protector, no more smudges and easy to clean."
"Good product working fine. I ordered it thinking that I will change it myself, but when I saw the ribbon cable attaching the phone body to the cover my hands started shaking. Finally I took help from someone who had done this in past. Looking at the sweat on his forehead I felt its always good to know what you can do , but more important to know what you cannot, ;)  Revising review on 11 nov The battery stopped holding juice after around 6 hours of normal workday no videos or extensive screen usage . Time to move to new phone"
"Works great! Never had a problem of the suction mount loosening or coming loose, even in direct sunlight! Will hold an IPAD Air 2 but you will need to put it in a case or use foam to fill the empty space."
"I'm going to be as thorough as I can because I was extremely weary of third party bands at this price. I counted on reviews from people when searching, so I'd like to help anyone else out in the same sense. My band arrived on time with some other Amazon items, the band itself was inside a small plastic bag along with a screwdriver and the blue pin removal tool to take out links.<br /><br />The band looks great, feels great, and exceeds my expectations at this price point. I have a 42mm space gray Apple Watch Sport, this band makes my &#34;cheap&#34; Apple Watch look more up scale. When in actuality it was cheaper than an official Apple Watch Sport band.<br /><br />I put it on to judge how many links to remove and the adapters click into place as would be expected. I even shook it around a bit over the softness of my bed to make sure it wasn't going anywhere. I decided I needed to take out two maybe three links. I started with two and the first pin popped right out using the built in tool. The second didn't budge and the tool broke so easy it's kind of laughable. I ended up getting the pin pushed out with the pin part of a name tag, though it was a struggle. I got it reassembled and I'm pleased with it. I really actually need one more link taken out but with the tool broken I'm either going to have to see if a jeweler will do it or order a separate tool.<br /><br />Since most likely everyone is concerned with the band and not the tool, my rating reflects that. Overall I am very happy with the band itself, the only way I could be happier is if they would send me another tool to take out the one more link I need."
Did not work with my 97' Buick. Not sure if it was due to my car or due to the fact that I got a jip piece. Pretty disappointed
"This case it's fantastic and heavy duty. Very protective, I have dropped my phone many times with this on and my phone is perfectly fine."
"It's a Minion case, but offers very little protection for an iPhone.<br />I'd skip this unless you're very careful with your iPhone."
"The case worked fine, but I left it by itself in the car while I took the phone inside, and the plastic of the case warped in the south texas summer heat. Now unusable."
Bought for my wife. Looks good for the first 24 hours then it started to shed. The damn beads are every where and it is peeling. The beads get stuck to your face your hands and everything else. This product is over priced nod it's really crappy!!!!!!
Cheap and sounds decent. My stock haed unit is okay but I need a 4 channel to really enjoy these. One surround had a dimple since the packaging facility at Rockford put all screws in little baggies and the bag got wedged under the surround and on top of the spider. Only cosmetic as the speaker works perfectly. Also found a home depot receipt in a box also. Lol buried treasure. Thanks seller for not including anthrax.
"These headphones has the latest bluetooth 4 technology and comfortable in ear design with interchangeable earbuds. Also these headphones works with iPhones, Android Smartphones, tablets, iPod touch, and other Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />The package includes a pair of headphones, a USB charging cable 6 ear buds.<br /><br />I was amazed that these headphones has a small button called multi-functional button. It also has a HD voice micro phone that you can talk through, and volume + and - button which you can use it to skip songs. There are more functions that you can't even imagine them."
It's a nice phone case.  It's not bulky yet it provides ample protection for the phone.  Looks nice too.l
Good. I like the corner bumpers. Easy to hold. Good protection when dropped.
"As described and highly recommended... A little shy on the edges but I understand why. It fits fine with an Otter Box and probably would with any protective case which fully wraps the bezel. The product arrived with a holographic seal and I feel quite comfortable purchasing from iMacket who not only cares about customer service but offers an excellent customer experience. The glass installed flawlessly on my Note 4 without any bubbles or halo whatsoever. - Nice job! iMacket has obviously taken the steps to implement great quality control throughout design, materials, manufacturing and packaging... and I truly appreciate that. - Thank you!"
I liked it but bad quality. I used for 2 week and it broke so easily
Love this case! Looks good and does the job. Fits perfect and gives all around protection. I didn't think I would need/use the kickstand on the back but I end up using it all the time.
"This worked great for 3 days. I took it with me to a tennis tournament where I knew my phone usage would be heavy. For the first 3 days, I was able to fully charge my galaxy s5 about 4 times. On the 4th day, I noticed that the device wasn't holding a charge and would only charge my phone for maybe a minute before it automatically shut off. If this worked like it did in the beginning, 5 stars for sure."
Good slim case. It works exactly as I expected. Provides small amount of protection without adding any bulk. No problems so far.
"Great product it's light and for my iPhone 6 perfectly. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light case, this won't weigh down your iPhone either, get one today!!"
"Looks great with a Apple watch, IPhone 6 plus, and a full sized iPad 4 with smart cover on.  Holds everything great, looks clean and organized, and the magnetic watch charger does a good job at holding the watch securely in place.  The wood has a really good look to it.  I'm impressed"
"The camera needs work; the zoom doesn't go that far. Other than that, I think it's a pretty good phone compared to my last one."
Easy to use. Battery meter and a fast charger for all your devices. I got mine last week and plug it to my car port and right away got the measure of the battery so I can even use it while it's off. Of course better to use while your car is on.  Definitely a must to get!!!!
"Best Case ever. All buttons and accessories (Headphones, Chargers) fit and work perfectly with the case on.  Slim design but not cheap. Has a nice smooth texture. Extremely light. Hand Strap fits well (does not include a hand strap but most any strap will fit on it. Extremely satisfied. Totally worth the deal. I would pay 25$ for it (base price). :):):) shrek approves too."
Good but feels cheap. Also phone only stays in wallet by cheap magnet. The phone falls put easily
"I like it very much. It has room for an Ionizer (smoker) to get rid of bad smells, a 1A USB charger port for my new Bluetooth Sunglasses for listening to music from my iPhone and answering/calling, a 2A USB charger port for charging my iPad. Did not get a full score as I was unable to find a cigarette lighter that fitted without removing the outer part of the lighter and I have to hold it in to make it work/get power. Reason for missing start: It seems the metal sleeve in the charger is a bit too tight, but I have had trouble with a couple of other double-plug chargers as well, but it might be me that is unable to find one that fits and no problem with the dimension of the charger. If so, please correct me and it will get a full score. The adjustable angle will make it fit in just about all cars: A nice feature."
"Does not work to transmit audio from a TV (or other item that has an earphone jack) to my iPhone 6+.  The seller was very helpful and after trying several steps, and communicating several times, accepted the return.  The seller's concern for customer satisfaction is exceptional."
"I bought this case for my wife's phone when we both upgraded our phones to the Edge+.<br />I had no trouble installing this case on her phone, other than it being a rather tight fit.<br />Once installed, it fit like a glove.  It has nice rubber sides contributing to a good sense of security the phone won't slip out of her hands.<br />The &#34;sparkles&#34; on the case are all recessed so it doesn't interfere with it laying flat.<br />My wife absolutely loves this case, and so do I, knowing her phone has a good degree of protection.<br />Great case, and highly recommended!"
"Great case, sturdy, and conservative looking!"
"I love the case, it's super cute and protects my phone well. However, the sides becomes gray, dark, blueish, very easily when placed in pants pockets, etc. So now the edges are blackened, if I could clean it, it would be perfect."
"This is a small form factor, well designed phone charger. I keep it in my work bag just in case my iPhone dies and I can't get to a power source. This is small enough to put in your pocket but, you will know it is there. It will juice up an iPhone 5 from 1% to 100% in about 30 mins or so and only once. But, that is exactly why you would want this. This is one full backup charge in a small package."
I gave it Four **** Stats because the Case is Great But if you have a Tempered glass protector the case pushes agents it and makes it bubble on the edges I have iloome Screen Mate Super Thin. But I LIKE the Diztronic Full Matte (Soft Touch) Get YOU One YOU Will Like It.
Everything on this order was fine. I got a great product at a great price. Well packaged and fast shipment.
Works well and a lot cheaper than the original Apple version.  Seems sturdier too.  But bear in mind it's a few inches shorter (36in vs 39in)
Very small phone mount not sticky at all and no 3m tape either had to file claim to get refund. just a bad seller and product
"From the moment I installed this product in my vehicle,  I fell in love! The Samsung Wireless Charging Vehicle Dock rocks! I have a Samsung Note 3 phone that has a wireless flip cover and I needed a Qi wireless charging dock for my car. The charger works every time I place my phone in the dock and I've had no problems at all.<br /><br />I love the fact that I can charge my phone easily and wirelessly. I also love the fact that the Qi Wireless Charger rapidly charges my phone. I've had others Qi wireless chargers that worked when they wanted to and charged very slowly.<br /><br />This is a high quality, very effective and nice looking product and I highly recommend it."
"The Samsung Galaxy Avant is okay I guess. I've only had it for a month, but the touch screen is laggy - oftentimes you have to press on a tab or icon more than twice to get it to do anything. Also, a tab will crash when surfing the Web. Don't ask me why. The phone looks and feels really cheap. Every time I press the home key button, it feels like it's about to come off and makes this annoying clicking sound. The battery life, as other reviewers have mentioned, sucks, especially when watching YouTube videos or listening to music. It drains really quickly. The sound quality of the receiver isn't that great, and the built-in speaker is so-so. But you get what you pay for, right?"
Tech Armor screen covers are outstanding.  Easy to install and no bubbles.  I would strongly suggest giving this product a try!!!
My oonly issue is where is the first package i ordered? Had to wait an extra 6 days and still im waiting on the case that goes with it. Package is cheap to say the least but its here and on my phone. And unlike other screen protectors this one is actually for my phone and not a universal one advertising as a direct fit.
Product does what it's supposed to do.  Easy to apply on phone and haven't had any issues yet. This was purchased for my fianc&eacute;es phone.  Compared to the one I have on my phone this is a little thinner but I also paid around 23$ for mine.  For the price it seems like a quality product.
I ONLY GOT 2 1/2 MONTHS SERVICE FROM THIS PH IT'S SITTING DWN AT HOME NOT TURNING ON OR CHARGING WHAT CAN I DO? CAN I GET ANOTHER PH FR U GUYS?
"Easy to apply.  Cracked and dont know why ,wasn't dropped or anything.  Screen is ok so guess it worked"
"Great item so far. Shipping was faster (10 days from Etronixmart) than what was listed on the order (2 months) which was a nice bonus. The buttons on the GPD XD also feels nice, similar to a 3ds xl but with double analogs that feels really smooth like a ps vita as well. All in all great device."
Matches perfectly with the set from my Infiniti DVD system. Worked great out of the box.
Works just as I needed. Great adapter.
"I bought 3 of these in July and let them sit in the packaging until August 31.  When I went to charge them, only one of the three charged.  I will not make this mistake again."
I have anger issues and i hate smart phones period. I get mad cause texting i can't tell what button im hitting so i throw my phone alot. Already been threw 4 screans. So this case pops off really easy and well yup screen #4 case didnt do s***.
"It did the job while I used it. The only issue is that my house key falls out if I adjust it while running. Also, if I go for longer runs, I get a rash from the sweat salt grinding under it. I switched to a FlipBelt, but that is just my preference. Feels good to have my arm free of it. I guess it would be perfect for you if you were just going on a walk or some activity where you didn't sweat."
It does not attach correctly.. It looked nice but the case was loose and the plug wouldn't connect to the phone.
"It dont work good , coudnt see a movie or netflix or youtube."
"*This is an update to a previous review.  The Alaska Life has amazing customer service and will do what it takes to make sure you are taken care of as a consumer.  After reporting an issue with my product, they responded and got the product replaced immediately.  If you are stuck on making a purchase between a few different products, be assured that this choice comes with excellent service to support.  Can't go wrong.  Looking forward to the future products ahead."
"iLLumishield for the Nokia 1520 is easy, easy, easy to put on. The first time ever that I've done the dry method without messing it up. It's beautifully clear and the surface is SO super smooth to the touch. I like this much better than Armorsuit that I had on my Lumia before it.<br /><br />The edges do not seal down completely due to the curve of the glass on my Lumia 1520, but with the protective cover on it hasn't been issue to deal with either.<br /><br />I thought I had something great before, but Illumishield is much better. So much better."
"I have had no issues with this watch, unless it searches for the satellite signal a little too long for my patience, but it never lets me down! Also love the app and how it syncs with my phone."
"Works well.  The shipping is slow though.  Ship from China.  The material looks cheap, but didn't affect the functionality.  It works well."
"It has been almost a month since I started using them. At first they worked well, but now the sign that says &#34;this device is not compatible with your device comes up often&#34; and sometimes I have to move the wire around several times in order for it to start charging."
"This wall charger works very well with android phones! However, if you have an iphone, you should consider another option."
"This fits my iPhone 5 perfectly and the armband adjusts so that I can strap it at any position between my upper arm and my wrist.  I use my iPhone when flying, so with the addition of the optional strap extender I purchased (Amazon), this allows me to mount the armband to either my arm, or just above my knee when strapped around my leg (sitting position) while in my flying harness.  The key slot is a nice feature, but one I really don't plan on using.  For someone who uses it for running or at the gym, it does make a lot of sense.  Price was very reasonable compared to the other two brands I had purchased and eventually discarded because the phone either didn't fit, or they were a hassle to use."
We absolutely love our new Garmin.  It was a replacement for an old Garmin.  We went for all the bells and whistles this time. The cool factor is the split screen when you approach a major freeway intersection and it shows you which lane to be in.<br /><br />We got the one with the case because it is a convenient way to store it when not in use.
"Nice item. Charging the phone is a little annoying, have to take plug out of bottom and the charger doesn't go in all the way."
"I really do like the Silicone rubber texture feel of these Wirelessky cables<br /><br />- 15 inch is a great size but compared to my 4 FT Galaxy S6 OEM Cable it’s a huge difference so make sure you know exactly what you want to do with it… Still great to plug in to USB Hubs or Portable power chargers<br /><br />- Seems to be easier and more flexible than some cables<br />- The Micro-USB end is smaller more slim than the OEM cable (as you can see from the pictures)<br />- But the USB End is just a hair bigger<br />- Great cable, that Should fit through almost any case, slim or not<br />- Seems durable but only time will tell how truly durable it is"
"UPDATE 3/31/17: This phone turned out to be refurbished, not new.  Also became a total dud, cannot recommend it after all.  First of all, we found out it was a rooted device and no efforts to fix that could ever get the phone to update.  Then the touchscreen had issues.  Finally, after 18 months (and out of warranty, of course!), the phone simply stopped booting up one day.  It would only cycle the LG logo over and over.  I sent it to LG based on their instructions, who knew it was out of warranty but were supposed to let me know how much to fix it.  Instead, LG just sent it back to me with this note:  &#34;ESN Blocked. Aftermarket alteration to phone voids warranty. ESN and color of phone do not match. Refurbished unit or non LG label.&#34;  Total surprise to us as we thought we were purchasing a brand new LG phone based on the vendor's description.  We have replaced this with a Motorola G4 and hope to have better results all around.  Buyer beware!<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW: This was purchased as a gift for my son's 14th birthday and for starting freshman year in high school. It was factory sealed, perfect condition.  We got him an otter case to protect from oopsies. He's very happy with the phone, especially loves the bigger screen, battery's long life, the quality camera. He's in marching band and his phone is his lifeline to keeping up with his schedule and communications with band friends.  We had to have the AT&T store fix the access point (we use GoPhone) to use the data plan, but now all is working fine. This phone will probably pass down to his brother or me down the road."
"[[VIDEOID:337a5584853242682937739abbe38f92]] I was sent this case by G-Hub UK for my honest opinion on this case.<br /><br />I am really impressed with this case, it's worth every penny.<br />It's really light weight, a great style with high quality production, the cut outs are great and the grip is second to none.<br />Great value for money, would definitely recommend it to all!<br /><br />Check out the video review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPBFj113Tzo"
Love it.  Awesome.  Like the life time warranty it comes with
This car charger seems to be very fast charging. I feel that it is much faster than my apple wall charger. I love how there are two ports incase my passengers would like to charge too. The white and grey is very stylish and I love the blue led which indicates it's charging. Very nice product!
Great tool added to our team.  Communication is a dream now and we do not have to use our employees personal cell phones.  GREAT TOOL!  Thank you.
It was broken in the first week... It is not a good material
Fits the phone and protects it well! My husband accidentally dropped it on cement and his phone was fine. The best cases available.
I love this wireless charger i use this one daily and never have any issues with it i bought several other wireless chargers and all broke within 6 months or less i have this one almost a year now and it is great it has three coils and finding the &#34;sweat spot&#34; is just a think of the past this one you can just drop your phone and keep it moving I find the blue light on the unit to nt be distracting when I sleep at all great for a night table.
"I put this in my wife's car as a replacement for another kicker combo set-up. Could not find the same woofer must be out of production, now I see why! This is brand new and still being made, excellent dual sub-woofer. Makes my wife's system really kickher..."
Absolute trash.  This cable feels cheap and does NOT charge any faster than a normal $2 cable.  Don't believe the hype and save your hard earned money for something actually worth it.
"Cute phone case but cheaply made, it broke a few months after I bought it."
"LOVED IT,NEEDED A CORD"
I like the color and everything
"Works flawlessly.  Original battery had reach end of life, you would need to charge the phone once, sometimes twice during the day.  Now with this battery based on my usage i go all day and sometimes til the next morning before charging.  Also the NFC chip works just like the original.  Some other batteries on Amazon got bad ratings due to lack of the NFC function.  This battery is definitely worth it."
Excellent product that works exactly as advertised. I wish the cord was a bit longer as the AC receptacle in the car that I am currently driving is located in the center console away from the dashboard but it's only a minor quibble as it still stretches sufficiently for my needs. Product arrived much faster (12 days) than was estimated. This cord is much better than the stock cord that came with my 265W so I would highly recommend this product to any Garmin users stuck with a bad power cord as I was.
"I've had this for about 3 months.  The case itself is unobtrusive, and I've noticed no degradation to the phone's performance.  My phone dropped 3 feet out of our truck and onto a paved parking lot today.  It bounced around several times, and I was cringing with every bounce.  The case protected it 100%, with no cracks or scratches whatsoever.  The case saved my $500 phone, which is why I bought it, so giving it an enthusiastic 5 stars.  At first I thought I'd got what I expected with the screen protector.  It was all scratched and lifting at the edges.  Finally I decided to just take it off ... and ... MY BAD; there was a thin cover over the screen protector!  With that taken off, the screen protector performs just as well as the Zagg protectors I like to buy, maybe even better."
"I actually really love this new way to combine my Wallet and IPhone 6+<br />I had a Metal Money Clip which I used and loved, but after 3 scratched credit cards I had to replace it, I threw in the towel.<br /><br />I like this one for a few reasons.  * The Pictures here are very accurate.  A tad heavier than a plain plastic case.<br /><br />1. Great Leather Feel, so much better a feel in my hand vs. plastic.<br />2. The Clip magnetically snaps. It doesn't move unless you move it. But cleanly is great for a stand to watch videos.<br />3. Good Tough Guy Look and feel. None of those clasps that Women uses for their purses.  This is simple and tough!<br />4. I keep three 20s in the lower part and my 2 credit cards and Drivers License in the top.<br /><br />My funny comment is after I put it in my Pocket, I for the first few days kept thinking 'Where is my Wallet'<br /><br />This keeps everything in One place, and for those like me who put their wallet in the bathroom, closet, kitchen, dining room and random places only to find you are now late for work... You get me.  IPhone 'Find my Phone' works in 1 minute, madly searching your house, pants etc... take forever and frustrating.<br /><br />Simple, Amazing Quality Leather, Slim and Cool.  I absolutely recommend this for anyone who doesn't have that<br /> &#34;George Castanza&#34; Mongo huge wallet.  And really do you ever need that 8&#34; of Wallet in your Pocket.<br /><br />Go Slim, the Ladies Love it!"
"Junk. Threw it out within a day, never stayed put."
"The volume buttons are not properly placed for the LG 740 Volt phone. There is also no indentation between volume up, and volume down functions. The belt holder also blocks the volume down button, disallowing screenshot use. I would give it zero stars, since I can't use it with my phone."
This is meant for running and obviously you sweat in it. This sweat seeps in and not a good thing for your phone
"Great product, high quality and a fantastic length; not frustratingly short and not comically long. Well worth the small fortune it cost to have this sent to NZ."
"Looks classy and great on my blue iPhone C, seems to be a very sturdy protective case, light up feature is awesome the front lights up as well. Lovee it my new favorite phone case!!!😀 and it also came very quick in the mail. Gotta love Amazon right !! Had all my friends amazed with the light up part and it's very sleek on the phone with good  buttons that are actually easier to press then the phone without the case."
Perfect fit and finish simplified a dreaded install
My favorite going-out case. Wish it didn't have the antenna hole. Very sharp and well-fitting. Love the coffee color combo.
"These are the best earbuds I've ever used, and trying to use any others feels dull after using these for months. Their quality is great, volume is perfect, and are comfortable on the ears. That being said, the only inconvenience is that I haven't had mine for even a year and they've stopped working. However the price is cheap and quality great, so I will willingly purchase new ones every 6 months if I have to. I highly recommend these earbuds."
"I have very skinny arms, but I measured before I bought it. My arm is about 9&#34; around, so this did fit it (just barely). I like the open face of it and the strength of the silicone. It's not as bulky as other brands."
"perfect fit, and heavy duty, great case for the note 5, pair it up with a glass shield and your phone is protected for everyday use."
This is a super thin case with lots of fun color choices!  Won't make your phone bulky and I've had it bounce off the parking lot more than once with no damage.
These wireless earphones gives a great quality sound. All the music sound and the voice during call can be heard smoothly. The earbuds are soft and comforting. I don't have to adjust it in the ears again and again. t was provided to me as a free sample to test and I recommend it to everyone.
"MFI certified and braided.  Also comes with tech armor's awesome lifetime warranty.  No competition.  A braided wire can withstand 10x the punishment before there is damage and the data connection was flawless.  It does not feel nearly as flimsy as the OEM wire.  Plus since its backed by the lifetime warranty I wont ever need to buy a replacement cable.<br /><br />Personally, I highly recommend the 6ft version as you can always coil it up, however if you get the 2ft version and find that you need more length, you can't add to it.  I personally prefer the black cable as it does not appear to get as dirty."
Love the case! The only thing is that other chargers besides the IPhone one doesn't fit and you have to remove case to charge it.
"Works well although not the highest voice quality when speaking.  Another nice thought would be for this to come attached to a phone holder since most people use one anyway. Then, you wouldn't have to stick it on the dash somewhere."
"I've had this on my phone for a year, I rarely remove it. My phone is in like new condition because of this case, its the best case I've ever owned for any phone.<br /><br />If I had to choose a con, it would be that it makes a large phone slightly larger and boxier, but that wont matter when you realize your phone is in perfect condition every time you remove it."
Works perfectly and arrived earlier than I expected. Highly recommend!
didn't fit my phone at all. It said it fit my exact brand and model. It's huge and I don't have a glass cutter. I just tossed it
Product is accurately made and fits perfectly on the phone. Looks very nice and seems very durable.
"Love the look and the idea, but the hard casing that fits over the soft bumper part did not stay attached on one corner. It just kept popping out. I finally just broke down and bought an Otter Box."
I love this case.  It took me a long time to choose one but I love Speck and will keep buying their products.  I have used it for a couple of months now and dropped my phone here and there with no issues.
Better than I expected for the price. I feel my phone is protected and the rubber on all 4 corners is pretty thick.
"Between everyone in my house, we use a lot of headphones and seem to go through them pretty frequently because we were buying inexpensive ones. I had the opportunity to get these and so far they work great and feel they will last a while. I use them for online lectures for school, and I listen to them with a bunch of kids running around and I can honestly say they do a good job at canceling out the outside noise. It's not completely silent but it's definitely not distracting. The only thing I would have liked to see with these is extra ear buds (or whatever they're called). You get one size, so it's not easy for my kids to use because it doesn't fit in their ears very well.  Other than that, they are a good, quality set of headphones and are comfortable to wear. **i did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback."
"Great phone case/cover at an amazing price! It's durable and fits my phone/ports perfectly!<br />Honestly, it offers the same protection but with more durability than my last OtterBox case."
For the rather unusual reason that a average consumer would purchase a &#34;fake&#34; IPhone is completely on you.  The phone looks and feels the same. As my iPhone 5s. Like many others I have a &#34;little thief&#34; that likes to take my phone. So now I just give them the fake phone and they're amused for hours. 10/10 would possibly recommend
"does everything it is supposed to.  Keeps the phone secure on my dashboard, in my line of sight so I don't have to take my eyes off the road when using navigation or navigating music."
Love it!  Word of recommendation; I recommend the phone battery case with the wireless receiver already install; for this to work great; I have the Galaxy S4 and just order my husband for his iPhone 6.
This is a great product!  I love being able to solar charge the battery and use that power to charge my phone. The lights are great to understand the charging/charging function. It is a great compact size and feels extremely dourable. The two USB ports are great options and it charges my phone quickly. Wonderful way to being power with you on be go.
Slim case that shows the beauty of the iPhone but not slippery like other clear cases I previously owned and the ports are high enough for all types of lightning cables and all types of headphones and the speaker holes are exact
...cheap stuff...if you put the metal piece inside the case and not glued on the outside it won't hold....specially on heavy duty cases...
This case has saved me from a shattered screen more times than I care to admit. I get lots of complements on the design too.
This little charger can be used so two devices can be charged at the same time. Very convenient for people always on the go.  Compact and actually works. Sleek design.
"Great case for the money.  Being clumsy I've already dropped it a few times, but no damage done. Looks really nice on the Gold 6 Plus."
"Perfect for cutting through the clutter, finding your stuff and getting out the door fast. I found Tile through their crowd fund campaign and bought four in November 2014. I liked my first set of Tiles, and probably used them once a week (mostly to find my keys to get out of the house faster).<br /><br />When I saw that Tile was coming out with a new version that could ring my phone, I jumped fast. Since I've upgraded to the new Gen 2 Tiles, I literally use them everyday. Seriously, a huge game changer, couldn't be more stoked."
my daughter had it 2 days and dropped her phone. the phone case broke. don't think it was worth the money
"Phone case was ok, plastic is not very strong. The clip holder assembly was completely worthless, the phone would get stuck inside the holder and not come out. I will not buy this product."
"Works great.<br /><br />Word to the wise, Amazon is full of &#34;genuine samsung&#34; batteries that are fakes.  Nobody is going to fake an Anker brand battery, so you are much better off with this.  It works at least as well, if not better, than the original battery when it was new.  Fits perfectly too."
works well... does get a little weird if I have my phone in my right leg pocket and bluetooth in my left ear... I really like the fact it tells you when the battery is low! I have had some that just went dead without warning..
The mesh on the front part where the speaker is started to fall apart after the first day of using it. I just slowly unraveled day by day. I hoped that after a while it would stop but it never did. The buttons on the side are also impossibly hard. Eventually I returned it for a refund. I think there is a reason Otterbox discontinued this case.
I used this device at extreme conditions (below 0ºC and above 4200m) for about a month and it performed extremely well. I really like this product!
Just perfect .<br /><br />That is what I need .
"I like the holder / mount, it is small, flexible and  doesn't take up much space and looks nice over the dashboard of the car. the problem is that I'm afraid that for the long term the sticky gel pad will wear off or collect dust, the other problem is that it can only hold the phone horizontally which means that I have to keep my screen rotation option on which uses more battery on my phone."
This case is durable without being too bulky. Most of the ports are easy to get to except for your mute slider. It's not too hard for me because I'm a female with small fingers but for a guy or someone with larger hands I could see this being hard to get to.<br /><br />Otherwise I have zero complaints and really love this case! One of my favorites!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
The Apple certified USB cords arrived on time and work very well.  I recommend this product.
"Actual JL grilles.  Works good as a protector for the sub, but it dents easily."
"Great product, but I have only used for 3 days since the first one came defective.  They replaced it right away for me by the way."
"Great product. I love that there is no adhesive. This means I can remove the protector, clean, then re-apply. No screen diffusion at all. The only con I could possibly have would be that it doesn't protect the entire screen (leaves the edges). Other than that, great product.  Side Note: Crazy fast shipping. Like literally ordered it Sat @ 4. Received Sunday @ 12. Crazy fast!! Thanks"
It didn't fit the prevail as I bought it for my daughters boost mobile prevail.  She was soooo disappointed.
Best cables I have ever seen or used. Both my phone and tablet charge faster.
"LOVE being able to charge my phone, find someplace random, and think about himself and his thoughts.  Please keep me informaed; I'll contribute in any way I can."
"Love this amp...thought I damaged  it, ordered another only to find the amp protected itself.  Now I have two.  About to up grade so I can use both"
"This was exactly what I wanted, fit perfectly on my phone, and came super fast!"
work as expected BUT!!! it makes little noises while plugged in. Like an interference noise. It´s very annoying if it is near you when you sleep.
"The product I Thought at first was petty good. It started with me getting a chip on the corner of the glass. I figured, I paid a premium for this just in case this happened.... Right?.... WRONG!. Contacted them via email. Was told to go through their website. Long story short, my Amazon order number was not recognized. Emailed again, was referred back to the website.... Same thing. Emailed again.... Nothing. 2 weeks later, still nothing. I contacted Amazon about this issue. Amazon gave me a full refund.... They stated they cannot make a merchant honor their warranties. If your outside of 30 days and your wanting your &#34;lifetime warranty&#34;. Good luck! 6% seem to get the same treatment. This should be illegal. Can't claim something to get the money, then totally ignore what YOU promised. Thank God for Amazon, otherwise I would have just been held up for 15 bucks! Plus the iAnder one works for privacy way better at shorter angles and a lot darker without having to darken the brightness on your screen."
"I originally purchased a different case for my new Galaxy S6 Edge+ but was not at all happy with it, and subsequently returned it.  Looked at this case and decided to give this a try.<br />The case arrived in 2 days.<br />Putting this case on the Edge+ phone is a bit tricky, due to it's snug fit...Especially with a Zagg screen protector on however, once I got the case on, it fit like a glove.  It's exactly what I was looking for with this phone.<br />It feels great in my hand, and the case doesn't interfere with the functionality of the Edge screen.  The rubberized texture gives just enough grip to give you a feeling of security that it won't slip out of your hands.  I purchased the red case.<br />This case looks stunning, and really contributes to the overall appearance of this great looking phone.<br />Fantastic case, highly recommended!"
"This came in waaaaaaaay too late. Like about two to three months late, when it said something like a week to two weeks. It wasn't even worth the purchase, either."
this is a good product you should buy this product is awesome. it arrive early . i give 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Fast Shipping / Good battery, very useful - Recommend it."
I think it's been a month already and this USB cable is still intact and working well. Seems like it's a really good quality charger.
"It's super cute, but kinda big and heavy to take it everywhere. It charges my phone one full charge, I don't know how many charges it is supposed to complete. I gave it 3 stars because is cute :)"
"It protects pretty well, the top and bottom are still exposed but the sides are enclosed.<br /><br />The soft feel is great and makes the phone easier to keep in your hand, but it's also a problem with the light colored ones.  The first time I put it in my purse it picked up dark soil, and no amount of scrubbing would remove it.  That won't be a problem for a black one, but my pink one immediately became very dingy looking."
It's just really hard to take off if I need too. I guess that's a good thing lol
Very happy with our portable power pack.  My husband has a classic car which he drives to different car shows so the power pack comes in handy when traveling.  I like that it lets us know when it is running low on charge also.
"Overall, I really like this case, it completely covers the phone. Although I have not dropped my phone, I am quite confident this case would do its job. The holster provides a tight, secure fit. The &#34;cons&#34; I have are less about the quality of the case, and more about user preferences. For me, the main downside is that this case does add width to the phone. If you have smaller hands, be aware that using the phone with this case often becomes a two-handed affair. The volume and power buttons are flush with the case, making them hard to find by feel alone. I've had this case for about a week and still struggle to find these buttons.<br /><br />As the pictures show, this case covers the charging and headphone ports. Since I use the charging port more than I use the headphone port, I do wonder how long that cover will last. After charging the phone, the port cover takes some time to return to the &#34;covered&#34; position (the port covers do not snap back into place, but the eventually return to a covered position).<br /><br />In short, this case will certainly protect your S6 and the included holster feels of solid quality. The cons I've mentioned might be user-specific, but thought they were worth pointing out. I thought about returning the case but I have not yet found something that is: thin, has a builtin screen cover, and a holster (only used-sporadically)."
"I love this product!  I had the 1st version and passed it down to my wife.  Yes, the batteries last for a year!  For the new version, the addition of the back light, timer and strap lock make this the best fitness band on the market today.  For the price and features, I would recommend this over any other fitness band."
This phone has lasted me for over a year and has maintained it's speed and responsiveness.  It even got the lollipop upgrade after which everything worked perfect.<br /><br />The battery life is fantastic and hasn't gone down much over my year of ownership.<br /><br />Iv'e dropped it a number of times and it only got a couple minor scrapes and scratches.  The screen is still perfect and great for reading articles and responding to emails.
"Within 2 hours of m review of the product, The retailer has contacted me (Via Text, phone, and email) to offer a return. Mind you, i ordered the product on march 27th and it is currently August 30th. I am amazed at this service. Sure i may not be happy with the product, but i am amazed by the dedication of the team behind this product.<br /><br />Here is my new more in depth review.<br />Audio: This device lacks in terms of audio quality. The headphones seem to focus more on highs and mids (which i prefer), but even then, the sound is distorted, as if listening to a small speaker which has been place in a cup.<br />Comfort: I understand that comfort can be subjective when dealing with in-ear equipment, but i find these to be incredibly uncomfortable. I have tried using different sized rubber on these things, but i can't seem to wear them for more than 15 minutes before i begin to have a headache. I believe this is due to the added weight of the earbuds (the battery and electronics are stored within the buds themselves, making them heavier than your average earbuds).<br />Form factor: The headset seems to stick out a little bit giving the weight a little more leverage to pull them out. This could be fixed by shortening the length of the earpiece by a few fractions of a centimeter or moving the center of gravity closer to the ear.<br />Battery life: I found that this device has amazing battery life for the size of the product, and it seems to hold a charge in standby mode. I haven't used this device for over two months, yet i was able to turn it on.<br />Cable length: Cable length is just about right, not too little where they can't hang comfortably, but not so much that they get caught on everything while being used.<br />Buttons: The volume buttons are placed perfectly. they are very easy to reach, and give a satisfying click when pressed.<br /><br />All in all, the GS-08's underperformed where it counted for me. I have since moved on to a pair of LG tones which i have found to be much more comfortable. Even though i may not like/use the GLYCON GS-08's, i would gladly purchase another product from them.gh i may not like/use the GLYCON GS-08's, i would gladly purchase another product from them."
"It worked for about an hour with my galaxy s5 and then it just stopped working, and has not worked since."
"Mine broke within a minute of removing it from the box. I put my note 4 in, but when I tried to take it out the cell phone holster seemed stretched to its maximum limits. I popped my phone out only to see the springs were stretched out completely, rendering the device useless. Piss poor product.   Update: the company was diligent about contacting me and insisted on giving me a new product or a refund. I took the refund, but they demonstrated that they truly care about their customers."
"Great bundle of cords to color code where and how they are used.  All of the cords I have tried so far work.  My biggest disappointment was that unlike the variety of colors shown in the picture, I received five yellow, three pink and two blue.  Not much variety."
For a quick burst of power for my phone it's hard to beat the price. It won't fully charge my phone but 45% will do in an emergency.
doesn't  look much like leather...
"I got this stylus and returned it on the same day. It doesn't work unless you really push it on your screen. I tried it on iPad 4, iPhone 5 & 5S, and iPod 4. Every time the same result. You have to push it very hard on the screen in order for the stylus to be active. Otherwise, it doesn't work. I don't recommend it."
This case is a great value for the money. It is very comfortable to hold The buttons fit very well. Overall extremely well-made and a nice addition for your iPhone.
Absolutely love this case exactly what I wanted and needed. The leather is perfect and I'm grateful for amazon's existence very cheap it would of cost a lot more in a store.
Fast shipping .. Good item
"It arrived sooner than expected, it is good quality and I am very satisfied. Would order from them again."
"This phone is absolutely terrible! It states that it is designed for use with AT&T...<br /><br />Okay, well first off, it is set for using up to 2 SIM cards, but the IEMI numbers do not match watch actually comes through in their system (they chronically think that it's a NOKIA). Second, straight from the factor the internal settings (VPN, APN, etc.) are entirely incorrect, even after cycling through two different SIM cards from AT&T. The phone never achieved 4G status (see above) and AT&T could never track down a troubleshooting/diagnostics guide from the manufacturer - NOT SUPPORTED.<br /><br />Do NOT purchase this phone. The package insert is useless and there is no user's manual that covers any details other than how to screw the battery plate into place, how to insert a SIM card, and how to plug in your charging cord.<br /><br />By the way - the charging cord tip (the metal adaptor piece that inserts into your phone) is a custom job - it's longer (deeper) than any that you'll find in any store. This means that you cannot buy one anywhere for replacement. I had to buy one while on the road and was stuck using my pocket knife to whittle away some of the plastic so that it might reach in deep enough.<br /><br />Do NOT purchase this phone!"
"I love this case!  High quality materials, very slim, looks great!  As good, if not better than Otterbox Symmetry.  If you can't guess by now, I highly recommend this case."
"Bought this for my brother who has a new LG android - while it looks fine, he didn't like it - I suspect that it was just not handy - not being able to get it out of his pocket quick enough.  He has opted for the slim plastic edged type."
"The case is great, however, the shipping was way overpriced! I paid triple for shipping-more than the product itself...disappointing! Will not order again for the amount I ended up paying!"
I am able to charge my phone with a full charge on the Anker. This is a handy piece to have around.
"I am very pleased with the Case. Its a quality construction and fits is a perfect fit on the phone, down to all buttons and plug-ins. Swivel and snap-ins on the belt clip holder appear durable. A very rugged yet professional look in full black. Again I am very happy."
Love this case! Perfect color and great quality for the price. I also like that it protects my screen and doesn't get stretched out!
"Fits on the vent of a 2003 nissan frontier fairly well. The best out of three that I had tried. Holds Droid Mini well although tends to depress the volume down button. I use this in other cars when needed, and it always fits in the vents."
"Decent case, very cheap.  Only downside is that the picture is misleading.  Lots of people poke fun at me because of it.  I don't care because I have a good come back and am usually clowning around anyhow.  The pic doesn't show that it has little nodes all over it.  The nodes keep the phone from touching the case.  When I say nodes...I'm talking LOTS of them and they are very apparent.  Usually someone tells me I have a girl phone case and I just tell them they are just jealous their phone case doesn't have nipples all over it.  Please see the pic."
Great product to put on the tablet to ensure it is protected and also has a nice stand on it so it can be propped up.
"This screen protector is very durable and easy to hold while placing on the screen. It is the exact size of the Samsung Note 5 screen from left/right edges so it takes a little long to fit it so it is covering the screen perfectly. This is a good thing because it gives room for your phone case. If there are any bubbles they are quickly removed when you use the provided cloth to smooth it out. Also, any particles that stick to the screen can be removed with the dust remover strips. If you take your time and make sure fans are not on, then installation won't be too hard. The screen may be thick but it does not take away from the quality of the screen. The stylis works just fine. It's not as smooth as it is on the phone's screen but there is no lag or issues while writing on the screen. All this said, I would recomend this product."
"I originally bought an otter box case for my new phone at best buy,  but was disappointed by the bulky design.  Saw this one online for about a fourth of the price & I absolutely love it!  Nice rubber grip, sharp looking and kickstand is great! Plastic corners offer protection from drops. Thanks!"
"ORIGINAL REVIEW: Great case- low profile and attractive, seems quality so far (I've had it for a month)  UPDATE: I dropped my phone onto the driveway and the screen was badly shattered, requiring an expensive repair. The repair shop told me that this case really does not protect the phone against damage when dropped. I would no longer recommend."
I loved this case! Made the phone easier to hold and was just very pretty.
Love this cover super cute.. Only four stars because it's so bulky any fit it in my back pocket because of all the decorations. It is very pretty and they give you extra rhinestones!!
"Obviously being Samsung original equipment, the fit is excellent. The front cover with the see-thru panel is nice. But that's where the good things end. Although this is an obvious flaw, you obviously can't take pictures or video by just flipping the front cover all the way around since there is no hole for the lens to protrude through. So the front cover just kind of swings awkwardly while you film. Second, it's Fingerprint City. I think most can tolerate this on the back, but with this cover, even the front panel gets covered with them in a matter of minutes. Kind of unsightly. But by far the most horrific problem is the fact that there is no latch magnetic or otherwise that keeps the front cover closed in place. Not only is this awkward and irritating when you are handling it, were it to fall, the cover would simply fly open on the way down, so it really provides very little protection other than maybe from getting scratched in your pocket. Cool concept, terrible execution. It's being returned immediately."
"Great case,very durable and the belt clip is a great feature..... Built in screen protector is good, could be better.....well worth the money"
"Purchased this case based upon a recommendation from a fellow realtor.  It makes life very handy to have everything at a touch of hand.  At first, talking on the phone was a bit awkward, it felt like I had my wallet on my ear - but soon I figured out the best was to wrap the strap around it so it wasn't dangling.  I get lots of compliments on it too!"
Bought two of 5-packs 3 months ago. 8 out of 10 cables quit working after 2-3 weeks of use. The remaining 2 will likely break soon too. Returned both sets. Unhappy.  Upate 9/7/15: The company has reached out to me that they have located a defective batch of cables and are sending me an upgraded replacement at no charge.
"This is the second of these cases I've ordered and it's perfect for my needs. The first one was for a Samsung Galaxy S3. I had it for 3 years and it performed just as I wanted. The phone and the new Note 5 that I just got, are very slippery and sometimes hard to pick up. I didn't want a bulky case. This case has grips on the edges that allow the Note to be picked up easily. The rest of the case keeps the phone from being so smooth and sliding off, or out of things, while protecting it. The first one I had, held up well, still flexible and didn't get all scratched up. I expect this one will as well. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it took a whole week to get it. I think I paid more than priority mail costs, for shipping and would have expected to get it a little sooner than I did. I was so afraid for the Note, until I got the case. Well worth the price.  Oh, and I love the color!"
"A really good Unlocked smart phone at a good price, I use un-limited Talk, Message and Data using Straight Talk's $45 a month card."
My old USB plug in overheated and warped plug in. Phone wouldn't even turn on. I thought my whole phone was dead since it wouldn't turn on. Installed this and was able to charge phone again and phone works great now! I also have no mic issues like some had. Install was fairly easy too. Thanks!
The case is good but the outer plastic layer sucks after on drop the plastic broke from where the volume buttons are. Otherwise it's ok.
"First of all i can say this product is really worth for the price . I saw people using selfie stick nowadays and i decided to buy one for me and searched here , Also some of my friends recommended to buy from here , Then i ordered selfie stick and really surprised to see the perfomence , I was really sick taking selfie with hand , Now this stick saved my time , Two features which i like is it must be foldable and easy to carry and the other thing its bluetooth portable and with a button to take selfie easily ,To be honest this product is 100 % worth of the price and also 100 % recommended from my side ."
"This is a neat little thing, but it looks like the Android app is a joke. All of the features boasted about on the Misfit site are not available.<br /><br />There is no smart alarm available on the Android app.<br /><br />It's 2015. Android is the DOMINANT mobile operating system in the world. Apple is a distant second. It's long past time that it's ok or even tolerable to have an Android app that is not always as fully featured as the Android app.<br /><br />Overall this is a cool device. I wanted a sleep tracker and smart alarm. I didn't care about much else. It seems to work. I'd keep it if the smart alarm worked. Sadly, it doesn't."
"Can't beat for the price. Installed in my 2012 Kia Soul. Install went easy. Display is very clear, though small, but DVD's are very watchable. . Radio sensitivity not as good as stock radio, but still good. Once I figured the sequence, steering wheel controls installed. No extra adapter needed."
I got this case for my grandmas phone and she really liked it!
I followed instructions unfortunately the fil didn'd adhere to the screen as it was supposed to. I tried twice to no avail.  I will never use this seller because the product is substandard and is not worth the price paid.
"This is a great little charger to have around when you're not near an outlet or in your car, where most of us have portable chargers ready to go. The housing is solid- it doesn't feel flimsy at all and has a nice weight to it. It's fairly compact, just about 4-5 inches high and 2 across. I was able to fully charge my Samsung Galaxy 6 from 15% in about 2 hours, which is great. I found that I cannot use it to charge my iPad, but I can't imagine what emergency I'd have where I needed to do that, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I'm not sure yet how long the pack itself will stay charged- that is something I plan to keep an eye on, and will update my review if I feel it requires charging too frequently. The only small drawback I truly have with this charger is that the sticky square mount on the back, meant to hold the charger in it's packing, was difficult to remove. It had nothing to do with the functionality of the charger itself, but it was annoying to deal with. Other than that, so far I'm very pleased.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Everything is almost perfect except space of charging point. When I use car charger, case needs to take off. It's not perfect for car charger."
"The team arrived in Venezuela with all its accessories, but does not start and unfortunately there is no way to fix it."
"Incredibly thin and cheap feeling, the image is awesome but there is NO protection at all. Also let the package air out a few days, the fumes coming off these has got to be toxic."
"I can't say much because they're not installed in my car. nonetheless, they look really great and I've tested them using my home theater system. they sound great and I think I'll buy another subwoofer from them soon. the one thing that kind of disappointed me was that it did not come with speaker wires or wire clips. what you see is what you get. 9/10. would highly recommend for budget and decent sound quality.<br /><br />UPDATE: The speakers work beautifully in my 2012 VW GTI. I'm very impressed by the sound and quality of these subs. I also bought a pair of spacers to tag onto the speakers."
"I tried this device on macbook pro, nexus 7, and windows tablet and they works fine. I currently use it mostly on windows tablet.<br />While on macbook pro, keyword works fine and the mouse pad seems a bit sluggish. I didn't try to adjust setting since my purpose was to try it out only. Other than that, this product works pretty good. One click or button to wake up the device. Once first recognized by computer, following connections are easy. Fist connect to windows device seems a bit harder but it can be windows issue because similar problem happened to other Bluetooth devices as well."
The BUDDIBOX case is sturdy and not bulky like the Otterbox.  Easy to add case to the phone for a snug fit.  Using the phone with case is comfortable and the buttons are raised offering much comfort. Accessing the charging ports and headphone jack is easy with the openings on the BUDDIBOX. The red color is bright enough to see when you lose your phone in your purse or on a messy desk.  I would recommend and/or purchase for a friend or myself again.
This device did not connect to my iPhone and also was very poor quality. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
"Good quality, works well.  I would have given 5 stars except it does not work if you have a case on your iPhone.  Small inconvenience for the savings vs buying a genuine Apple product.  Tip is slightly larger than necessary thus you can't plug into phone portal with case on phone."
"This is a great case. It's sturdy and fits well around the phone.  These cases, it doesn't matter if you purchase it from Amazon or the apple store, does change colors. All clear cases do. I've had clear cases for years from different brands and they all do the same thing.  Highly recommend."
Cute!  May daughter loves it.
"I wanted the cologne so badly that I didn't see that this was after shave.  I was so disappointed  I did not want after shave.  I also didn't read the fine print that said I cldn't return this product. My husband will use it but he didn't need it, nor want it.  We want the cologne. My fault for not paying attention to detail."
"Great case! I bought a large waterproof case years ago that has served me well over the years for water parks, etc. This case however is perfect because it is small and specifically for phone. I have a Note 4 and yes, it fits easily even with my Ringke Fusion case on. Its a small case so I don't know if it would fit with an Otterbox but mine fits."
Nice little case that does not add a lot of bulk to the phone.  It makes it easy to spot which phone is which.  It also makes the phone easy to hold on to.
Fast  delivery A++++++++
Product is okay.<br />Amazon.com service ¡VERY BAD!
"I do outrigger canoe paddling and SUP and I don't do a workout without it now!  I love how I can have so much information spread over 4 screens with each screen being able to be split into another 4 sections.  All the info I ever need while working out on the water on my own or with the team.  I haven't even reached its full potential yet, but love how simple it is to use right off the bat.  Keen to pair it up with a heart rate monitor and add that info to my workouts."
"Was showing error when connected &#34;this accessory might not work with iPhone as it might not be certified&#34;. Bought two of the cables, one of them showed this error. Mine is iPhone 6."
I think i received the wrong item ... it looks the same except the one i got does not have then sensitivity adjustments in fact there are no holes there at all  and one end had female RCA cables the other side had male cables  i thought this one had speaker wiring on one side and RC on other also  my subs sound like s*** ... they have decent bass and are 500w each but you cant really feel it in your chest  i am using this to hook up an amp to a stock head unit for my subs
I am on my 3rd one - after about a month the first one quit holding a charge. I was sent another one - same thing a month in quit taking a charge.<br />I must say the company has been great about replacing it. I have had this one for a couple weeks now and just took it out of the box today. It is taking forever to charge. The suction cup was NOT in the box as stated. I am NOT pleased with the product at all.<br />When it does work - it's great for what I want - to pair it with my iphone and listen to the radio at work. But if this one does not work _ I want my money back - I can not keep wasting time on this.
I wish it could fit a slim phone case so I didn't have to take my phone out every time I use it. Other than that I have no complaint.
"The case fits perfectly. I have no trouble using the lock and volume buttons or plugging in the lightning and audio cables. I like the silicone edging which should help absorb the shock of a fall/drop. There are sturdier cases available, but they look very industrial; this one shows off the phone while still offering some protection."
"Its very beautiful!  I have an unusually  slim area for a a license plate frame, I need a plate very very thin to get behind the back up camera on Toyota Camry (2014) and PA plates are big too, so double whammy, this fit beautifully!! Very happy with t he frames, you get 2, thats a deal, really!  If they tarnish or rust I will change my post.. so far, they are great!  Worth the wait!...well its been a few months and I have noticed some brownish looking, could be some tarnish, on a few rows of the crystals.. I will wash car again to see if this is dirt, but right now, that is making me wonder??? will update again if I am wrong..........Update, this beautiful plate does indeed TARNISH!!!! Wont buy again,dont recommend, sorry.. its all tarnished,I never go thru car washes,either, I wash my car by hand....very disappointed that its all tarnished...Update 04/02/16..HI, I have to say the seller is very attentive about trying to fix the disappointment I have had with my tarnished plates...they are very beautiful, but in a few months, mine did start to tarnish and now they are all tarnished with yellowish especially behind the crystals, but it is tarnished all over, the seller, will be sending me new ones and I will update again in the future, they are very good people to deal with and have bent over backwards for me, and I do appreciate that, hence the 4 stars....kudos to the seller..they do care.."
I have used it for months and it still looks great
"Bought this phone for my 17 year old daughter and she loves it so then I purchased one for me. I love the size, still getting used to it. I had a Nexus 4 before this, which my husband is now using which is a move up for him. Seems like a tiny lag when swiping the screen up while on Facebook but that may be because the screen protector is on it and I am not touching close enough. I love the phone but make sure you purchase the sd card so you have plenty of space for all the apps."
"Holds two cards really well. Will hold three if they don't have the numbers pushed out on them (ie they are completely flat).<br />I was a little worried how long it would last, as I open it at least once everyday. But it has held up for 5 months so far!<br />For the price it is totally worth it!"
"I bought phone in Jan, problems started in April...broken by the 3rd month of owning.  I must restart the phone every time I want to charge it. Phone is not recognized by the BB link, The camera screen would blink green...<br />Issues are STILL not resolved.  Their customer care  resolution...to update software without plugging in and would lose my data.  Software has been updated and the phone STILL has the same problems<br /><br />I paid $600 bucks for this phone.  BlackBerry does not have a solution nor will they give me a new phone.<br />Their customer care is obviously out of the US since the only time they called me back was over 4th of July and didnt leave a message.  There for they determined the ticket was closed.<br /><br />Sadly, this issue is the very same problem they had years back...too bad BlackBerry hasn't changed their service at all.<br /><br />Disappointed...money wasted"
It's great if you are a male with a big ear but otherwise if you are a woman &#34;beware&#34;<br />It hurts and ear is sore for awhile after taking it off.<br />I do like the way it informs you of incoming calls. It would be great if they made more sizes
A 'little' smaller than I though (although the dimensions were clearly posted). It's a well made case with a better zipper than I expected and a harder shell than I expected.
I love the convenience of this product. The sticky tape that holds it on is very strong and secure. It's made from a nice stretchy material that is tight enough to hold just one card but does expand a good bit. I'm bad about forgetting to use it but I'm sure as time passes it will get easier to remember it's there. It doesn't add a lot of bulk at all to my phone case. I even use it occasionally to hold a mini bic lighter and it has yet to stretch out. Nice product!<br />* I received this for free for my honest review and I do recommend it!
I LOVE It Best Case for my LG G4  the Body Glove Black Slim & Flexible is non slip the grip is great and it Look's Good too I Love Body Glove Cases. Get one and you will Love it too.
The case seems really sturdy.  I like that there's a separate clip you can attach and it can swivel but it is not easy to turn.  You have to work at it. Definitely a good buy.
The case is a really good fit for the Galaxy Note 4 but it doesn't cover the edge as much as I expected. Top and bottom edges of phone are fully exposed.
"This is a really great phone case. It really does protect it from accidental drops..which is something I definitely need!<br /><br />The design is also very nice. I love the vibrant pink color, and the slim design is very attractive.<br /><br />Note: I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"Great screen cover. The only complaint I have is it doesn't go all the way to the edge of my phones screen. I don't know if it's smaller to fit phone cases. I have the otter box on my phone and there's still a pretty good gab between my screen protector and case protector, so there's quit a bit of dirt that collects on the edges."
"Purchased this to replace old AM/FM radio.  The Mfine AM tuner is worse than my current one, which is why I needed a new one in the first place.  Went to all locations in the house, upstairs and downstairs, would get static when dialed into a station.  Must be getting electric feedback from other devices in the house.  Returned the product and get a full refund.  On the lookout for another AM/FM radio to try, will try one with an analog tuner to see if any better than this one."
Bulky but that is what you expect if you want the phone to be perfectly safe. No problems at all writing emails with the plastic cover. Nicely done by OtterBox.
"Charges fast from the orange port for my Z3c.<br /><br />I bought it to use the top port to charge my GF's iphone, but I'm not sure if it's too much current.  I emailed the manufacturer and haven't heard a reply yet."
The package came under another brand's name why?
"Charges just as it says it does, very nice that it recognizes what device needs what.  Took this camping, little long on recharge in the fifth wheel with a generator..3"
It was a gift.  So hopefully it worked what it was intended to do.
looks just like picture . fast shipping ! The radio is very light in weight . hope it works good.
"These are Excellent Wireless Bluetooth in Ear Headset! They lay comfortably around my neck. The rubberish material easily conforms to anyone's neck and shoulder size. They are extremely lightweight. I love the magnetic pieces that hold the ear buds so when they're not in your ear they automatically go back to &#34;their home&#34; securely. The controls are incredibly user friendly. All the buttons are easily accessible and clearly marked. This set is by far the easiest set I have ever used to pair. You don't have to hold down a button or series of buttons for a certain amount to pair like my previous ones which I love! The sound is extremely clear and consistent whether im listening to music, taking a call, or watching tv on my tablet. They have a decent reach roughly 2 to 3 rooms away from the device they are paired to. The battery life is very good. They charge fast and last even longer. Overall I love them I wish they reached further but all the other features definitely make up for that. I also like that the charging port has a cover so dust and other elements are getting into the interior of the headset. I did recieve mine at a discounted price in order to offer my unbiased and honest review. I hope my personal experiences help you get the most out of yours. Happy Connecting!"
I bought a pair of these at Target for $100 as a gift for a friends birthday.  I liked them so much I bought my own pair.
iPhone 6 plus doesn't like it and constantly says it isn't an approved charger.  Ipad 4 and Apple Watch work fine with it.
"Absolutely amazing value. I used to be a big fan of Klipsch, having owned two pairs of S4i and one pair of Ri6s and the Brainwavs Delta easily matches up in terms of sound quality even at half the price. The seal and noise isolation isn't quite as good, but is still very on point. The wire noise is minimal, the wire is light and not intrusive, and with the foam eartips that are included, these can be comfortably worn for hours. I love using these while I work out because they're so light. Furthermore, the one year hassle free warranty makes this hands down one of my favorite earbuds I've ever owned."
"This is an awesome GPS case, it fits my new Garmin GPS and charger with no issues, and protects it and gives me an easy place to store my GPS and charger during trips so it will not get lost, forgotten or stolen. I am sure this case is just as good as more expensive cases."
Scared to buy at first since it said used but has been a decent buy. The front volume buttons have issues but I bought  the interface for my steering wheel controls from a local  car stereo shop and wireless remote for it that I ordered from Amazon as well.
"Works great, and paired right up with my Note Edge. What more could you ask for? Not much.<br /><br />Please pay attention to the warnings about this thing not being for the larger phones, such as the Note Series. I originally owned a Galaxy S3, but had an opportunity to upgrade to a Note Edge before it arrived. The Note phones are too big for the spring-loaded holder. That's not this item's fault, so it's not right to deduct for it."
"i received this product free for review and it works great. it is very easy to put on my phone. and easy to open, once i put it on my phone it was pretty easy to see there were no bubbles or anything . it works great and fits perfectly"
"Nice, inexpensive watch band and dresses up the black Sport model. One of the pieces does not slide in and out as nicely as the Apple bands, but they do come out. Also, for the detail oriented, the part that slides into the watch is not quite flush with the watch body. Pretty much as advertised."
The outside border that holds the whole thing together broke down by the charging port after about 2 weeks.
the slots for the watch band are covered by this making it very difficult to change bands or put back on
"Very slim, chic, all encompassing, protective case. The layering within the case truly aids to it's low impact when dropped. And, I love how the case is designed to amplify sound through the iPhone's speaker -- very nice touch. I've owned the case for roughly 2 weeks now and I am very pleased. The case also allows for a nice hand grip with little to no slippage."
"Arrived on time and undamaged.  It fit the bars fine and the rubber liners help the fit, and keep down vibration.  My Garmin Nuvi attached perfectly and does not move when underway.  For information, I ride an 18 yo Harley, so vibration was a concern.  Screen is easy to read while riding."
"Very pretty, fits iPhone 4 nicely, but if you are looking for a case to protect your phone, look elsewhere."
"Charges iphone and ipad rather quickly. Capacity is insufficient to charge an ipad completely. Also, this thing takes forever to recharge itself! Like... 5 hours or so."
Mic doesn't work at all can't make phone calls. If you referbish a phone you should make sure all of it works before you sell it
This case is exactly what I wanted and good quality.
"I love the size and dual ports. However, for being 2.4 amps per port, it seems to charge my phone rather slowly. I tried using an amperage app to measure what I'm pulling, but it doesn't recognize the charge. Odd..."
"I love this phone case it's been weeks and it hasn't started fading at all. It came with a screan protector, the case, and a stylus pen. I was pleasently supprised since I thought it would only be the case! I get compliments every day with this case and I consider it an absolute nessity"
"Fit my Note5 perfectly. Craftsmanship of case is on part with cases from Incipio, Belkin, and other name brand."
Exactly what I wanted/needed. Good quality. Everything fits and it looks great.
The case had a defect. The bottom corner (touching the screen) would not sit flush against the phone. Case was way too bulky and very prone to dust.
I was very please the Motorola Battery for my cell phone. I would be happy to buy again.
"This product is great, but I was disappointed in the arrival time. Although it was only one day late, I wish I wasn't given such a specific date."
"So far, this product works great."
"The car charger doesn't stay in the outlet and the wall charger seems to drain the battery, instead of charging the phone.  This cell phone bundle is crap and a waist of money.  I will not be ordering from ShockWize again."
It's a case. It protects my phone. It's not very clunky. I will continue to leave it on my phone until I no longer like it or I get a new one.
"Got this case for my hubby's ZTE Speed phone by Boostmobile and he loves the rugged look n its easy to hold, not slick like some cases. This has rubber grips , plus a stand for using on desktop."
Was working great but then stopped working after latest apple update. Iphones have technology to detect whether products are Apple certified. These don't work anymore as they are not Apple certified.
"After having the newer large suction cup and having them fall off with temperature variations, and even damaging the interior as the detector drops, this mount is VERY secure. For best results though make sure your visor is one that is level with your roof line and hood. Otherwise you have to tilt the visor to align correctly. And yes it does fit the SOLO 2 and 3 models."
"It looks so nice,  fitted the back of the phone however i made it too sick"
Very fast shipping. Quality of the product is great. Would recommend this to someone who just wants a simple transmitter without all the fanciness
"Wow, I did not expect a perfect phone in every way. Perfection to the detail. All the papers, sim card etc were included and I can not tell you how impressed I am with it.<br />Thanks soo much."
"Installation was pretty easy as it just uses a long USB cable to connect to my F750. However, I mistakenly assumed that the camera's up orientation would follow the lettering of the label on the back of the camera. Once I had powered everything on and checked the camera view on my phone...I saw that it was upside down with no obvious way to change the orientation in software. I had to remove the camera, find some replacement 3M tape and reinstall with the correct orientation. The video quality is decent and my only complaint is that there are no orientation markings on the camera itself or in the minimal installation instructions."
The opening tool broke only after a few uses. The pin that is used to hold the suction cup in fell out and the tool is no longer usable.
"I love this little cable! It's the perfect length, doesn't get tangled and unlike my previous ones, the wires haven't pulled out or frayed from the ends. I will definitely be buying a few more."
It works well ... I cut a hole in the back to allow my extended battery stick through. wish they would put scoring on the inside to mark where to cut for the extended battery. OH well the case works well in a difficult phone to make a case for.
"Perfect. Fits perfectly on the top of the phone and works great with iPhone 6 Case, Spigen® [AIR CUSHION] Bumper [Ultra Hybrid Series] [Crystal Clear] Air Cushion Technology Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for iPhone 6 (2014) - Crystal Clear (SGP10954)"
Great design and very sturdy!  Love the colors too!  The price is wonderful for five cables!
The edges don't stick very well. All three of mine eventually peeled off no matter how clean your phone was.
Ummmmm this does not charge my iPhone 6. Sad:( and sad I have to plug something into my iphone6... I just wanted to be able to place it and charge it.
"This fell apart, kind of disappointed.  Because all of the card slots were super handy.  Wish there were a better design so, the backing held up better."
"It worked the few times I used it to power one device over the past several months, but when two USB cables were plugged in (only one connected to a phone), it smoked (that unique, burning smell of something electronic).  The description says it has fuse protection, but there is no simple way to open it to check the fuse."
Just what I needed for my daughter whose phones' cables break down fast. And it's inexpensive in comparison with the original ones.
"I bought this case for the novelty of the wooden material, but this thing just turned out horribly. It's bulky, it has bad grip, and it's very flimsy. The thing broke within two days of using it, after falling a measly 1.5 feet onto the floor, it shattered to pieces. What good is a case that can't even protect itself? Complete waste of money."
"We bought this both my and my husbands phones.  LOVE that if something is going to give... it's the invisibleShield glass that breaks and not my phone glass... And... on my Samsung, I've had to replace it twice now. It's not the mfg fault... I'm the one dropping my phone and it does protect the actual glass on the phone... just look forward to the day that neither break."
"My favorite case for iPhone 6 Plus!  I've bought three!  There was nothing wrong with the first one - that phone just got stolen :(  So I bought two more for my new phone.<br /><br />The bumper on this case is the business!  Yes - it makes the phone a little less streamlined than some other cases, but I feel like the protection is awesome.  It also makes an already hard to handle phone a little easier to grab on to."
I have used this same product previously on other devices and I love it. I have had to replace once already on my s6 but that was because of a set of keys that scratched the protector and it was laying on them all day and I didn't realize it.<br />Application is
Great sheild for the nexus 6. Little hard to put on but they all are. Just be patient and take your time putting it on. Also feels much smoother than the regular glass which is kinda weird.
"These ear buds can connect with two cellphones OR two tablets at the same time.  That's pretty cool.  Usually if one of my kids is using one of the blue tooth speakers I can't listen to it in my ear buds.  (Although it's the same music they are listening to, I like to listen with ear buds so I can tune out everything else.)  I tried these out over the weekend and they worked great.  I was able to listen to the music in my earbuds while my son had it playing softly for him to do homework.  I have not tried it with two cellphones yet but I am anxious to do so.  Charges fast and has good battery life.  They are also sweat proof.  I LOVE that feature!  I live in the south and the heat and humidity are miserable.  I have ruined a couple of pair of ear buds because of sweat.  My husband used these while mowing (and sweating profusely).  There was no problem with the sound, connection, controls, incoming calls, etc...  The sweat didn't affect them.  They sync up easily, the sound quality is great and they are comfortable to wear.  No complaints here.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review."
I never write reviews but all anker products are the best!
"If not for the fragile stand in the back of the case, this would be a 4-5 star item.  The sliding pins/posts are easily broken. I am currently using 3 of 4."
Arrived faster then expected.  Works great while t the beach and while scuba diving and swimming
AWESOME  only need LEDs to show solid connection for each port
works great.  going to take it on our 3 week vacation..
It's a piece of trash!!! Battery lasted for about 2 weeks and then never worked again!! And the thing to put it on the wall never last... It falls every time
Works well with XMP3 portable player. Although the one pictured is not what they send. I actually like the one they sent me. It's a Delphi remote that's much smaller and thinner.
"Music starts cutting out when I put my phone in my pocket. You would think with my phone only being 4 ft away from the earbuds, that this wouldn't be an issue. I will be returning them."
"For every phone I had, I would always get two additional batteries so I could always have charge when I went out. Each battery usually lasted around half a day.<br />When I got the Galaxy S5, suddenly my phone could last three whole day, and instead of getting more batteries, I thought I might as well just get one of these.<br />It was a great choice. I can charge my phone 5-6 times on one charge, or charge others' phones, too. I used it on a week long camping trip. If you have anything you can charge with a USB, it's nice for long trips, too! Depending on the charge, it can take up to a day to completely charge.<br />It won't over charge and keeps its own charge without wasting unnecessary power.<br />It looks nice and you can fit it nicely in a backpack. It's nice to take to events you don't know will have outlets, or if you just want to discretely charge your electronics.<br />I might even buy another in the future! Worth every cent."
This wallet phone case is very well made.  The phone easily snaps in.  I like the added protection of the cover when I put it in my purse or when it is just lying on the table.  Magnetic clasp is strong.  I also like how it folds to a stand.  It's perfect to use to entertain your toddler when you are at a restaurant or appointment!  I also like how you can close the cover and still talk on the phone.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
"Cable worked for a while, but does not connect to IPhone anymore.  Worked for a while, but not as good as apple products."
"[[VIDEOID:878adf1360dc96064c2774c3adaef4dc]] So your looking for a charging dock for your desk or office but your not too sure if this is the one for you?<br /><br />Watch in HD here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ve_X3SOMk<br /><br />I was sent this sample from G-Hub Amazon UK for an honest review.<br /><br />If you don't have an iOS device but instead an Android, Windows or Blackberry smartphone this dock is also compatible.<br /><br />What's great about this product<br />Stylish and solid build<br />Charge the Apple iPhone & Watch at the same time<br />Great for looking at apps/notifications or watching movies while on your laptop/desktop<br /><br />If you have an Apple Watch you can attach the magnetic charger to the dock, otherwise you will need to use your own charging cable for your smartphone.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it to all."
Love the pens my husband sticks one in his shirt for coviinence it's there when ever he needs it .
"Beautiful case, well constructed considering the low price. After having the case for about a month, color is fading a bit on the spine of the case."
Excellent charger for the price and great length
Save yourself expense and frustration down the road.  You don't find stronger and more reliable cables for less money than these.  The braided nylon jacket prevents the normal cracking and breaking of the wires near the Lightning plug. These cables are strong enough to allow you to use your device while it is charging.  The added length is also a welcome addition to the standard 3 foot long cable. I liked them enough order more than one. Highly recommended.
I cleaned my band due to getting dirty & unfortunately my band has now turned white and I am very unhappy about that.  The color also started coming off during my cleaning.
"You Must Buy This One in the event that You Travel A Lot. It Has huge Capacity, i charge my galaxy s6 about 3 times.The 4 LEDS give me an estimated sign of the charging and remaining status. Which is Great For Android Mob. Telephones in the event that You Watch Movies a considerable measure While Traveling."
"Simple fast car charger. Works as intended. Can charge multiple devices at once, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />In hindsight it is a bit large in width. Would be nicer if it was a 2x2 square instead of 4x1, but it functionally works as expected.<br /><br />4 stars overall."
Don't buy this product! It stopped working less than three months after I purchased it.
Fits well and looks great! Sometimes has issues plugging in to the headphone jack with aux cord. Maybe need a slightly larger opening so it stays connected better.
"Really great case! Good size, weight and durability."
This works well in the car and it shipped very quick and was good price! Thanks my husband loves it!
"First let me start by saying I’ve purchased many Anker products over the years, however the Powerline Micro USB 3ft Gray I am writing about was supplied as a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I buy Anker products because 1. They work as advertised,  2. They hold up (my first purchase was an Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh External Battery which has made two trips to Disney World, and I continue to use often),  3. Great warranty (18 Months) 4. The only time I needed their customer support it was top rate. (helping me diagnose an issue, sending me replacement, ultimately resolving the issue in a professional and courteous manner.).<br /><br />The Powerline Micro USB has tradition Micro USB cable connection ends so its just as easy to use as any other Micro USB cable.<br /><br />Where it shines is its durability due to being built with bulletproof kevlar fiber.  For my purposes, its the perfect cable for use in my car!  The power port in my car is in the arm rest.  While there is a notch for the cable to come out,  unless you hold the cable in place while closing the armrest,  it pinches the cable enough to almost immediately cause marks and shorts in other cables.  This Anker Powerline Micro USB has held up to a week of opening and closing the armrest without any issues, marks or shorts.<br /><br />This cable will also be really good for those on the go who often just toss their cords in their bag.  You wont have to worry about tangles and untangles causing shorts in the cable.<br /><br />Using the Powerline Micro USB cable in my car with the Anker 9.6A / 48W 4-Port USB Car Charger with PowerIQ Technology was a breeze.  Plug one end into the Car Charger,  the other into my phone, and it charges things fast.  Connecting my Nexus 6, 2013 Moto X, and even the dock for my Moto 360 watch,  it charges them as fast as the Car Charger allows.  No slow does due to the cable.<br /><br />Compared to the standard Anker USBcables I’ve used, the casing on the Powerline Micro USB cable is visibly more sturdy.<br /><br />Over all, I’m impressed.  Anker has managed to build a great cable that is durable enough to deal with life in my car, or my backpack,  that can charge my phones at full speed, and I don’t have to worry abou it developing shorts due to the stresses I put on it.."
I would have given this case five stars except the color was not as described. It is not red and teal. It is more salmon pink and teal.
"I received these a week ago and after wearing one of them for 2 days it broke. I'm wearing a different one now, and it is cracked."
"***Ok, it's now a couple of months after the installation and I'm upgrading this little unit to 5 stars. It's dialed in, set to my preferences, and now all I have to do is the occasional tweak to the remote knob on the dash depending on the track / genre that's playing through the head unit. There's a respectable amount of bass, it's clean, it's got a good punch and I'm not abusing it at all, just using it to fill in the bottom end. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if I needed a sub for another vehicle, and I've recommended it to several friends / family that are upgrading their systems as well. Still haven't covered up the blue LED, but it's situated on the dash so when I'm driving, the steering wheel blocks that LED from my eyes... I'm ok with that.**  Had it professionally installed in a '94 Chevy C1500 regular cab under the passenger seat, out of sight. It's paired up to a Pioneer head unit using RCA plugs, and filling in the bottom end for the Pioneer 2 way 4x6 dash speakers and factory 4x6 pillar speakers (pillar speakers soon to be replaced).  First, I bought this on the strength of the reviews I read here on Amazon. I'm happy to say, this sub seems to live up to those reviews. It's only been in the truck for 2 days now, so I'm still dialing it in, but it rocks. Even the installer (who had never seen the LOPRO8 before) was surprised in a very good way as to how nice it sounds and has said he'll be recommending it to his customers looking for something to fit in a small space. No, it won't rattle neighbor's windows 3 doors down the street, and no, it won't vibrate the mirrors on the car next to me at the stoplight, but I'm 53 years old and WAY past that stage. It fills my truck cab VERY nicely without overpowering the rest of the music, which is all I need or want. I spend an hour each way in my truck back and forth to work, and this will make the trip quite enjoyable. I predominately listen to rock, blues, classical and jazz, and so far from Rimsky-Korsakovto Metallica to Al DiMeola to BB King, this sub seems to perform extremely well and I am VERY happy with it.  My only issue is the brightness of the blue LED for the remote knob. Yeah, that'll be covered with something very soon - it's WAY too bright and very distracting."
"This is not Amolded so don't expect this glass to stand up to the came torture your original could. The kit is comprehensive but I suggest using a blowdrier or heat gun before separating the screen from the glue over the LCD.  These tools work but weren't able to separate the glass from the glue on my phone. Mine does say Samsung in the glass, and looks like the original. Just know the glass is not as resilient."
"Awesome product, like always I've come to expect from iCarez team.  Get this Glass, you Won't be disappointed!! :)"
I think mine were broken.  The high frequencies didn't come through.  I sent mine back.
This is a nice cover for the new Samsung Galaxy 6 edge plus. It's nice and slim so it doesn't add any bulkiness to the phone. It's not a hard cover but if you want to keep the phone nice and sleek this cover is a must.
"I liked it and everything, one thing I didn't like about it was how overtime the color wears off that's why I gave it a 3 star."
"Works great, I charge my Android phone, iPad, Bluetooth headset all at once, all at full speed. Very convenient that it only uses one wall plug. Must buy if you have multiple mobile USB devices. Ontop of all that, it is made by anker, who has one of the best warranties and customer service in the industry."
The paint used to make the sides of the case look metallic was already chipping when the item arrived otherwise the red looks like what is shown in the picture.
"Works as intended for rapid charging of multiple devices. A bit bulky, but to be expected by a 3 USB car charger.<br /><br />Shipped quick and works as expected. Overall, 5 stars."
I have had this now for several months.  It arrived on time and has done everything the manufacturer promised it would do.  It has been especially helpful in tracking my sleep patterns so that I can make necessary adjustments.  I love the info it gives me and I feel great!
"First radio, can't go to much in depth on it. After I get my liscence and see what it can do I'll update."
"Horrible quality.<br />It attracts dust inside the screen protector.<br />And don't know how but unintentionally it is getting broken on the sides, and today I took it from my pocket and I saw it is broken completely on the top left corner.<br />I spent $14.99 bucks on this product and it is not even working like a $0.99 worth product. Simply waste of money, tech armor deceives people projecting their stuff as quality but their quality is not even worth a penny.<br />I knew that I have one year warranty on this product, I will see if tech armor will replace the defective piece, otherwise I will write one more review mentioning the type of service I received from them."
"Update - Sept 10  I have performed additional testing and I found out that the issue is not the battery, is the upgrade to the new Android Lollipop release that I installed in my cell phone some weeks before buying the Anker Battery.  The result of the tests in summary is that the Anker battery lasts at least 3 hours more than the original battery.    I have read some forums and I have implemented several of their recommendations to improve the battery life.  By the way I am very pleased with Anker support, as soon as they read my previous post, they contacted me apologizing and offering to replace the product.  I want to apologize for placing a bad review before comparing the Anker battery with the original one.  =============================================================================================== [Old Review] Battery doesn't last.  It even lasts less than the original one that i replaced."
So handy to have a back up battery especially with grandkids using my phone... True to advertisement and quick shipment
"Great value, soft and have a nice grip.  Fits my phone well.  The only thing I hoped was the option to chose one color if I wanted with a  cheaper price.  I definitely didn't need this many cases..."
Perfect fit. Just read the instructions.
"Since using PowerBear, my phone periodically reboots without warning as heat of battery causes it to shut down.  Great idea but this has not been product tested enough to be considered as a quality, market-ready product."
Great case! I like how slim it is while still feeling like it provides a fair amount of protection.
"Nice band, great addition to my collection."
"I loved the case!  It fits my phone snugly.  You do have to press kind of hard for the buttons on the side, but it's really not that big of a deal!  Love it!"
"This portable battery charges my phone faster than the actual cable! The only negativity I have towards this product is that it takes a bit of time to charge BUT that was stated in the manual. The size is fine in my opinion, it is bigger than average battery packs but it charges my phone within reasonable time. My sole intention for this purchase was to use during vacation and in school.<br />A unique feature of this battery pack is the flashlight that is activated when you press down the power button.<br />The functionality of this battery is simple and it doesn't require to much time to grasp the concept of this battery."
"Very happy with the case!  It looks fantastic and is great quality --- especially for the price.  Received it earlier than expected which is always a bonus.  One minor downside ---- when using credit card slot, the case does not touch the phone screen thus the screen does not automatically go into sleep mode.  Still very happy with purchase and would buy again."
The case showed up in a timely manner. Was exactly what I ordered and has a really great feel to it. The little kick stand that allows you to prop the phone up works great and was something I didn't even know I wanted. Would reccomened great quality and product.
"Definitely a time saver when charging your device, or just needing your phone's micro USB for something else. The only downfall I have had with this, which isn't a fault of the device, is you need to position the device almost perfectly for it to charge. There is a (blue) charging indicator light that goes around the entire front of the device; it changes green when you're at 100%. Very convenient for travel as well."
"I was originally looking for a way to reduce alternator noise. After reading online info, seemed the best thing to do was find a way to take my high level speaker inputs that were run directly into the high level amp inputs from oe system and make them low level inputs for lower distortion. This unit not only turned my 4 channel speaker outputs into 6 channels. it combined it all into full range for the ft and rear and low for sub channel. It has adjustable bass levels and ... no alt whine.<br />Id give it 5 stars but I'm picky and it would be much nicer to have a separate max light for all 3 outputs, not just 1. Takes a little fiddling to get it right. but all and all very nice addition to the system. very happy."
"This product is not worth the money,SCAM it is. GO burn your money else where, It crashes like your windshield. If there is a negative star, I would rated it as (-)."
"I don't normally post reviews, but really like this item. Not only the  item, but the excellent service. When it first arrived the envelope was half torn open with missing parts and when I called they immediately sent me a label to send what I received back to them. The replacement they sent got here literally the next day, before I even had time to return the unused parts. I paired it with my tablet, and it works very well. The sound is good and seems to noise cancel as well.. I originally bought them for my Dad to listen to on his tablet and who has a hard time hearing. This is lightweight and will be perfect for him. I liked them so well, I am ordering another for myself."
"Sound quality is pretty good (heavy on the bass). They pinch my ears a bit, so if you have a larger head they might not be for you."
I returned this. I dropped my phone from barely 4 feet off the ground and my entire screen shattered. I would say if you are going to use this case get a tempered-glass screen protector because it's NOT a hard case. I upgraded to the otterbox commuter...
Convenience of having multiple devices charge at once. Appears to be high quality. I don't notice any significant change in charging time with this unit.
I love this case. Easy to hold. Buttons easy access and the gold matches perfectly. I'd buy it again.
So far works as advertised. Haven't tried multiple devices at once yet but have charged iPhone 6+ and iPhone 6s.
"These are amazing! I have ordered several for friends and family. The warranty is unbeatable, I actually did drop my phone and it did its job and just shattered the protector. The company sent me a new one at no charge."
"Worked in the immersion test but immediately ruined the phone first time it was immersed with the phone in it. So you think, you get what you pay for, right?Ruined a phone with a real Lifeproof that had a crack in the edge of the rubbery seal. That one at least worked for a few months but Lifeproof did not honor their warrantee with two of three cases that broke inside the first year. Lies, dishonorable practices and planned obsolescence."
Exactly as expected...great item fast shipping.
I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />This charging system arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assemble.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with this cable.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
"This is an unbiased review of the Maxboost slim case. When I received the product I looked over the overall quality of the product. It is very nice and has all the right cutouts.<br /><br />I tried putting on the case and it was a little hard, snapping it on was an issue for me. After putting on the case I saw the protection wasn't that great but it's a sacrifice for a slim case. If you buy this case it mostly like getting the Apple cases, without a bigger lip to protect from damage to the front of the device.<br /><br />The case is very slim, I have a glass screen protector and I recommend if you buy the case your get the Maxboost glass screen protector as well. It's also slim and you won't get a thick protector. Incase you drop your device this is something great to have."
Robust and so far effective. Excellent guide how to apply it.
"Product arrived on time as expecteded, however product had broken part and bottom looked a little beaten up. I was able to glue piece on. Product works as intended with no real issues. Next time I will make one instead of buying one cause construction is sub par."
"Bought this for my child for emergency purposes. I love the all the features, esp the ability to connect via wifi.  Even though it has 3g the connection is just was fast as my 4g phone."
Fast and good quality
"42 days.<br />I had planned to write a review based on the quality of this product as it certainly appears both sturdy and well made and it comes in an impressive box.  But I thought I should wait for three months to see if it lasts since it seems that is when it has been failing for many.  Mine lasted 42 days.  I was out of town and didn't take it with me for a week of that time so actually I got just over four weeks use out of it.<br /><br />There are plenty of choices for 30 pin connectors, but based on a clear failure rate that seems to indicate this won't last for more than 12 weeks and may not last four I highly suggest finding an alternative.  Although it does appear like a well made item, internally it clearly has a fault.  I hate to give anything a one star review but four week's usage is a new low, suggest alternatives to this one."
"I received this product, and I really liked it. But the only issues I had with this product was the case was slippery the material could have been made with a material that prevented slippage. Overall the product was good. Will recommend this product."
"This case is pretty cool I must say. I took it out of the packaging and it feels sturdy and extremely durable. I love the pink on pink color combo with the white accent. I have a white iPhone 6 plus so it looks just like the picture. I would not recommend it if you had a black iphone 6 plus. it'll look funny. The other thing is for some reason my iPhone fingerprint does not work with the case because the case edges are kind of lifted to protect the corners a bit more than other cases. Not sure if it is a good thing or bad thing. I also have long nails so maybe those 2 clash. I just took off my passcode and fingerprint so I can get into my phone if I need to. Other than that, super cute, and great price! I received this at discount in exchange for my honest review."
"The really really bad:<br />1) I think that these headrests are potentially unsafe in a rear-end collision.  They tilt quite far before they hit the tilt limit (the whole headrest tilts, not just the screen) and the connection between the posts (that go into the seat) and the headrest is plastic.  I just am not at all confident that they would actually protect my neck in a rear-end collision.<br /><br />2) Problem 2 is that the audio did not work.  No sound out when headphones were plugged in (not sure if these have internal speakers or not, but also no sound when no headphones were plugged in.  Checked the operation of the DVD player (working fine), tried a few different head phones, no luck.  Contacted Pyle, and they said to return it.<br /><br />The good: They fit my car well (2006 Honda CRV) and were fairly easy to install.  There are included post shims for use with cars with different sized head-rest holes (NOTE: 2 of these shims have slots cut in them - the instructions don't say, but I think these are to allow the latch on the seat to engage the notches on the headrest posts) and the posts adjust side-to-side to allow for different post spacings.  There is a mechanism to keep the head-rest centered."
"Really very functional - quick delivery, absolutely loved it. Top marks!"
"nice quality, holes deep enough for the USB cord to fit in.  Very pleased.  I would definitely order this<br />product again."
"The phone is very well sealed inside this case, so sealed i have issues getting it opened to chsrge my phone. (Charge cord protective piece is hard to take out) .  I like the wristband it really helps with not dropping the phone. I do not like that is not adjustable. Packaging was great i feel  my phone is safe when it comes to water . So im guving 4 stars. Improve the charge ports seal and the wristband . And ill give this a 5 star and he willong to pay more."
"The item is simply crap. Not only that I received it more than a week to late, the item is not at all like described! CHEAP CHINA PRODUCT!"
units came as described in packaging...very good shape. Units advertise 35 mile distance...I haven't been able to get them to work effectively beyond about a mile...hoping they do better on the water...but so far not what I was looking for in terms of performance.
"Great Product for a reasonable price. It does take some time to charge, however, it holds a decent amount of charging power!"
"using this to take video on my iPhone that requires hands-free or prolonged stability. Pros: Good price, stable relatively large base clamp, stable easy-to-use clamp on the phone end, easy to manipulate the shape of the arm. Cons: when the arm is more fully extended or hangs against gravity far from the clamp, it has a tendency to sway/bounce with minimal disturbance (e.g., wind, vibration)."
"I purchased as a gift for my wife and she love it, my strategy was simple 1 apple watch with the sport band in apple store and many bands in amazon."
This is an okay product. It had a hard time holding my LG G3 without a case and did not fit into the vent very well. It kept on swaying left and right due to the clip not being small enough to create a good grip.
"It's come to my attention that many people don't really understand what they are buying when they buy a power bank, also known as an external battery. So I'd like to start by briefly covering what a power bank is and what the various terms mean that are used when discussing them. If you're already an expert on this topic, please skip the next two paragraphs to read my experience with this product. If you simply want the summary, go to the last paragraph.<br /><br />A power bank is nothing more than an external battery that you can use to power and / or charge just about any device that has a cord that connects to a power source via a standard USB port. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and configurations, but there are really only three things to look for when looking at performance. One is the number of USB ports on the device, another is the amperage (listed in milliamps or amps) available through each port and lastly, the total amount of energy stored in the battery, which may be referred to as &#34;capacity&#34; for which the units are usually referred to in milliamps per hour or mAh. If you have a newer Android smartphone or tablet that you want to charge, then you want a power bank that offers a 2 amp USB port. If you have an iPod or iPhone, you can generally get away with a single 1 amp port, but I always recommend having at least one 2 amp port. A power bank with more than one port will, in theory, allow you to charge more than one device at a time. The thing to keep in mind when shopping for a power bank is that manufacturer claims are often inflated to at least some degree. The most often exaggerated feature is the mAh capacity of a power bank and total amperage output is a close second. Capacity is important because more capacity allows you more device &#34;up-time&#34; per charge on the bank.<br /><br />Over the past several years, I've been asked by a variety of sellers to test and review their power banks, and while I always did my best to accurately review each item, it was impossible to get precise, quantitative data on the performance of the banks because the only way to do so is if you have proper testing equipment. You can give anecdotal evidence like &#34;It charged my tablet quickly,&#34; but you really can't measure the mAh capacity and the amperage put out at the USB ports with any kind of accuracy. Writing informative and accurate reviews is extremely important to me, so I've since acquired testing equipment that allows me to get precise and accurate data regarding the capabilities of a power bank or charger; and I have to admit I'm excited to finally know without a doubt that I'm giving accurate information about a product.<br /><br />All that being said, here's what I found with the OLALA C2-i 6000mah Portable Charger ...<br /><br />It has 1 USB port and one built-in retractable Lightning plug on a 2 inch wire, a power button and a four light blue power level indicator and roughly measures 6&#34; x 2 1/2&#34; x 3/8&#34;. The built-in Lightning cable has a 90 degree end that is too wide to fit my iPod Touch 5G with its Otterbox Defender case installed, so I had to trim the insulating rubber surrounding the plug with a razor blade (see picture) and it now fits and charges my iPod just fine.<br /><br />I received my sample of this product and fully charged the device, which took only a short time, as it was mostly charged on arrival.<br /><br />Using a Load Inducer, I placed a 2.4 amp load on the USB port and was able to draw that power for 5 minutes without issues. Next I used the load inducer and a power monitor that measures total power consumed (mAh), and placed 1.8 amp load on the power bank, and it provided 3,580mAh at 5 volts (4,838 mAh at 3.7 volts). I charged the unit back up and ran the test again with the power bank ultimately putting out 3627 mAh at 5 volts (4,901 mAh at 3.7 volts).<br /><br />Power banks use a 3.7 volt battery, as do most cell phones, but the USB standard is 5.0 volts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the powerbank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged. Because of the voltage conversion and other factors involved, there will always be some energy lost, so no power bank will put out 100% of stated capacity to the device to be charged.<br /><br />In summation, this power bank is capable of putting out 2.4 full amps and it will easily put out a steady 1.8 amps (and maybe more) for the duration of the charge, which is more than enough to charge any device you might have. Having a power button helps keep the bank from slow draining when not in use, and the blue LED lights indicating percent of power remaining and charge status is definitely a plus. 4,900 mAh is enough to greatly extend the battery life of a tablet, and charge pretty much any phone two or three times. My testing indicates this power bank puts out 82% of advertised capacity and that puts it somewhere in the range of &#34;good&#34; to &#34;very good&#34;. Anything above 90% of stated capacity is considered excellent and of the dozens of power banks I've tested and reviewed, only one or two have broken the 90% milestone. This power bank does a good job, and I'd like to rate it 5 stars; but the 29.99 price tag (at time of review) makes it a little on the expensive side for a power bank with its capacity. Still, the built in Lightning cable is an added value that most of the competition doesn’t have and that may very well make this a worthwhile buy for iOS users. I’d rate it 4.5 stars if it were possible, but I can’t do that, so given the good performance and the uncommon feature of a built in Lightning cable, I’m going to round my rating up and not down.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟ts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the powerbank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged.

It's a soft case but I've dropped it twice and it certainly acts like a hard case!  Colors are great.  Had several comments.
Using it for my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 on my work desk. It will hold the phone vertically without falling over.
"This is a great case, stylish, rugged.  It does add a bit of bulk, but less than others with a similar level of protection.  Feels good in the hand.  It makes my HTC One M9 feel like a Moto X, Which I always like the feel of."
This item sucks!!  Had it on my phone for not even ten minutes and when i go to slide my finger down on the screen the whole screen protector moved with my finger. The screen doesnt stay stuck to my phone. It is pointless and a useless product.  Waste of money
"Eventually, I found something working well in my car!  Now I don't have to hold my iphone all the time!  Great!  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!"
Great valueg
"I've recently upgraded from my old 3 year old? Note 2 which was a great phone, but it started to get slow this year and I knew I had to upgrade. After watching a few YouTube videos I felt that this phone was the fastest on the market when it comes to multitasking (which I do a lot.) It's been about a month since I bought the One M9 and all I can say is &#34;impressive, fluent, unique, and beautiful&#34; the fastest phone I've ever held, the longest battery life I've ever seen, it's durable, loud, vivid and eye catching. Everything you could want in a phone even if you are an iOS or Windows OS user :)"
"Came a day early before the earliest estimated date!I looks nice,feels comfortable,and seems somewhat protective. But, around the camera the cutout looks as if it were cut on the right side. This case also tends to slip off the phone at times, which caused my tempered glass to shatter due to lack of protection."
This is a great case for the phone. I am a big fan of the OtterBox cases. They WILL protect your phone. Please be aware though that the cases are large and make the phone bulky so just be ready for that.
Just what I ordered. Good quality and came the next day.
Battery arrived dead. I charged it but would not hols a charge. Seller was easy to accommodate the refund but I should not have had to pay for the return shipping since the product was obviously defective.
I have had this product since June 2015 and it would not take a charge after 3 months. Vendor not willing to exchange. What a disappointment
"A little too small in width for galaxy Note 4 with UAG case, but it can fit in and the velcro is secure."
"Fits perfectly into the S5 with very little work needed. Wonky delivery system, but still arrived quickly. If my friend broke her charging port cover for a third or more time, I'd buy this again."
Not good material to be goIng in and out of your pocket.it does hold up well so the product was just okay..fast shipping
"Good deal for the money.  Offers some protection from impact, and makes the phone less likely to slip around and get damaged."
"For some reason, this tracking unit doesn't keep battery power.  In other words, I have not really been able to test it out because it is using up batteries in a matter of days.  When I have tried it, it seems a bit vague as to whether the tracked location is close-by, near-by or in the general area.  (Not specific enough to be helpful).  Good concept but not useful due to the battery (CR2032) issue."
"Absolutely outstanding battery life and water resistant, for these two reasons I bought it to double as my bike computer.  Now onto the weaknesses, no flash for the camera and is pretty mediocre.  If you don't need the battery life I would go for the latest moto G instead for the better screen and camera."
"Perfect case. It is incredibly thin, looks excellent, and provides great protection for your phone. You really couldn't ask for more out of a case. I would pick it over Otterbox every time."
"After a few days, my ear started hurting. I have normal sized ears. Connectivity is good though. Also, only one piece is included."
"center metal screen rusted out quickly, not very pleased with this product."
"Biaoge should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a worthless piece of junk. This item broke the second day of use! If they have any integrity, they will contact me to offer a full refund. Read the reviews and look elsewhere."
"I was so excited about getting this phone. I like the size and all the features. It arrived just as expected in two days. I had phone for a week now. Today, all of a sudden when I went to make a call, the receiver can not hear me. I did everything told to get volume, nothing works. Looks like I will have to send phone back.....disappointed"
Product was exactly what expected and advertised.  Satisfied with my purchase.
"Really good case with a strong magnet. Good feel. The slot on the inside is glued shut and you have to carefully use a sharp knife edge to open the glue joint holding its edge shut. Warning, the slot puts a portion of what ever card you have in it on top of a strong magnet and that will wipe out a magnetic stripe so I suggest not using the slot at all with any card that has a mag stripe ;)"
"Prompt shipping, great case!"
"Love the case, it's tough, easy to grip and textured so you can hold onto it easily. The fit is perfect, not to tight that it's a fight to get it on or off. The graphics could be a little sharper, that's my only criticism.  Delivery was much faster than the listing said."
Charges really fast. I like it and the length.
"Great product.  I've used other types in the past, and this is the best by far."
"Cases for my I phone 6 plus are very limited I have noticed, especially when it comes to cute girly prints.  This is absolutely adorable because pink is my favorite color and I love the two different shades of pink together.  I love that it's very simple to just put on and take off.  This also comes with an excellent screen protector too!  This is a wonderful phone case!  I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"Great sound for a small area, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, by the pool, on the beach etc. but for dinners and parties you need to go bigger."
Watch as durable it's a nice thick rubber style band Durable.  Screen size is perfect viewing the best you can get for a watch. It has all the capabilities of a normal phone would have. But it sure beats the price of those iPhones.  I plan on getting a Nother one. And I did receive this for a heavily discounted/free to give a honest review on.
Absolutely love. Received my order faster than expected too. Exactly like the picture and fits my Note 4 perfectly.
"The battery works as expected, restoring my phone's battery life to what I estimate is comparable to its original life when my Nexus 5 was new. I've been using the replacement for three weeks with no problems."
It was a gift for my son and he was thrilled with it. It's doing it's job and keeping his phone protected.
"Seems to work fine for a few weeks but......<br />As time goes by 1,2 have stop working.  I was hoping the new and improved cords would be better.  I have burn marks near the connector.  And smells of burning plastic"
"I used this glass screen protector to protect my new LG G3.  So far, it has kept my screen scratch, dust, and crack free.  Admittedly, I haven't dropped my phone, but I've heard the glass screen protectors act as a sacrificial screen should it drop and it will crack before your screen does.<br /><br />I paired this protector with a slim case and together, they look stock on the phone but I feel protected. [[ASIN:B00XKHSZKC LG G3 case, Caseology® [Daybreak Series] Slim Fit Shock Absorbent Cover [Drop Protection] LG G3 case]]"
"This is a great pouch; HOWEVER, it is NOT suitable for an iPhone 6 in an Otterbox Defender. The case makes the whole thing just too snug.<br />I ordered the next size larger (Iphone 6 Plus (5.5 inch) PU Leather Pouch with Back Clip and Magnetic Closure), which fits perfectly.<br />Before that I had a smaller one for my iPhone 4s. Love these pouches."
Battery has worked fine after several months of light/moderate use in a standard (non-Smart) cell phone.  Price was great and I am not disappointed in the capability of this slim Samsung battery at all.  Younger &#34;power users&#34; might think otherwise.  It takes a charge as quick as the day I bought it and will go days in between charges (with light use) which is something my Kyocera cell can't do with a fresh Chinese knock-off battery. OEM parts sometimes pay off.  I know it does with my camera batteries.  Just sayin....
"Great Wireless Charging Kit for my iPhone and SamsungS6<br /><br />I purchased this wireless charging kit to use for my iPhone 6 and Samsung S6.<br /><br />I have the iPhone 6 but my wife has a Samsung S6 phone, due to Samsung S6 is Qi enabled, so the qi pad fits her phone perfectly well. For my iPhone, there is an iPhone receiver kit in the box, I do not need to buy an extra one, it's really helpful.<br /><br />As soon as I place my iPhone 6 or Samsung S6 on the pad, the pad quickly to start working. Now I just need One charging pad and it’s enough for All our phones.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone looking for a wireless charging solution for their iPhone 6 and All Qi-enable phones."
"Awesome case, handily you can charge the case separately to the phone which speeds up charge time! Only complaint is the speaker reroute is not very good; sounds a bit tinny I drilled two extra holes in the bottom to allow sound to escape the case; seems to have sorted that issue nicely! Just looks like there is a headphone jack hole on both sides :)"
"Lightweight, but super protective. Love it 💫💫💫"
"I've reviewed dozens of DC chargers, but this is only the second one I've seen that offers four charging ports and my testing indicates it performs exactly as the advertising claims.<br /><br />I tested this charger using the same methodology that I employ in the testing of every AC or DC charger I review. Using a [[ASIN:B00KFS4Y1I USB Power Load Inducer and Tester]], I tested each of the ports and was able to maintain a 2.4 amp load on each port. I then left the load inducer on one port set at 2.4 amps while plugging in a Galaxy Note 3, S5 and ASUS T100 10 inch tablet, which I know from experience to draw 1.65 amps, 1.4 amps and 1.6 to 1.8 amps respectively. I allowed this test to run for fifteen minutes and encountered no issues with the charger.<br /><br />My test results show this charger to be a very good product. In this case, being capable of charging four high energy devices simultaneously; and at the price of $12.99 (at time of review) this is priced very competitively. I like it and until something better comes around, this is one charger I won't be giving away.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟"
"After purchasing many brands and types of screen protectors over the years, Maxboost HD glass screen protectors will be the only screen protectors I will ever buy from now on. Extremely easy to apply as long as you follow the simple directions and have a few minutes of patience to get it straight. Currently we only have two iPhones with this screen protector on them for almost a year now. Neither has yet to show any signs of scratches or chipping, even after one too many accidental falls and hits. It has never shown any issues with the touch screen functionality, nor any lifting around the edges. If applied properly, you would never know it was there. Major perk buying one on Amazon is the price and lifetime warranty that you get. Buying any brand (plastic or glass) screen protector from your local store, starts out at around $25 and up. Save your money and protect your phone with the Maxboost brand on here!!!"
Not a true Full Body case as titled. I later saw it says in the description that it does not have a built in screen protector.
"The case seems to be pretty good . it is watertight ,the finger print ID on my phone still works, but the screen part seems to scratch easy."
I'm looking to buy 3 more blue family and for is asking for this blu because they are doing fantastic
"I would have given this 5 stars, however syncing with bluetooth has been a major problem. The first day it worked great. The second day it would not sync and I had to unpair and then pair it up again and got it to work.  The third day even unpairing and trying to pair again would not work and I cannot get them to sync."
Broke within 3 weeks.  the actual metal piece that attached to your phone came out as if it wasn't even attached in the first place.<br /><br />I have never seen one break that way.  It just came out in its entirety.
Arrived quicky and works as stated. Very happy with the screen protector
"For an inexpensive smart watch great.  No wifi which would be nice and take notice of the phone carries sim card that this watch will except.  There might be a way to get them all to work, not sure how myself."
Very satisfied!  Color was a perfect match with phone just as stated.  Couldn't be happier!!
"If your looking for a cheap touch screen and don't care about Bluetooth then this is your unit!! Installation was a breeze all wires are colored as they should be, unit performs all tasks flawlessly very impressed for an 85 dollar unit!"
It was a genuine product and I love using it. The case looks like a genuine leather and it is strong enough to hold the tablet and safe gaurd it.
"I just received today 08/31/2015 but, it doesn't fit my Galaxy S5 Active.  I will have to look for another Armband."
"I had to send a new phone back to the company and pay for postage which they say the put back into my account. Lots of time.<br />New phone did not work, took it to Verizon to verify it was a bad phone.Now I am gun shy on ordering a phone now and what if I have to send that one back. This was for my son who is still currently using a borrowed phone."
"I really like this case but it just tends to break from the bottom part because its thing in there, I wish they could make the exact same case but made of aluminum, they do have one that's it's made of metal or whatever but it doesn't look like this one so that's why I don't get it."
"Awesome product very thin and very easy to put on and doesn't get in the way of my case, I will be recommending this to my friends"
Purchased the charger for my husband. After 2 weeks it broke. The front unit popped out. Hoping this is fluke. I plan on returning it.
"Solid product if you're looking for a selfie stick. Solid build quality, highly recommended."
"sync, charge, do what ever the apple cable do with better quality and durability."
Nice price on a nice shield. It was easy to install. Still going strong after about a year.
"the product is strong and durable but I wish it had a flap to hide the credit cards, license, etc when you are talking on the phone.  I don't like having all my personal items exposed when I have it up to my ear.  Otherwise, excellent product and strong."
Very basic phone that helped us stay connected on a trip to Europe.
"I like that it is glass which is better than those thin plastic protectors. However, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a perfectly clean screen. There are tiny pin size imperfections, maybe caused by the adhesive on the sticky side. They aren't bubbles or dirt, just imperfections. Also, the protector does not cover the entire screen because the new phones have curved glass on the edges and they inform you that these are designed to be flat. They can't make the protector full size because it would allow dust to get under the curved part."
Works well! Perfect for my phone
I was so looking forward to this but it doesn't fit my car's VERTICAL air vent. I gave it to a family member. It was so easy to setup and use. It would have been perfect if it would fit MY car. I didn't want the kind that sticks to the window.
It interfaced with my old Galaxy S3.  I'm still working on figuring it out.  Sometimes I even have trouble getting it to turn on. That cannot be operator error!  Have managed to get some pretty awesome selfies.
"Best product, no worries where to connect your device."
"In exchange for a fair review, I was given a PROMO code and I am just amazed!"
Got for my wife. We really like to take care of our phones. Does what it's supposed to do. Good product.
"About 7 months after I purchased this unit, one day it suddenly stopped working. I contacted BESTEK because it had one year warranty. They told me to send it back. I sent it back (I had to pay return shipping.) No answer for a month. I sent an email again. No answer for another two months."
"The case fits over the camera, but it becomes very difficult to use the buttons at the top of the camera. The power button and the the button to open the flash are very hard.  Not taking the buttons into account, the flash was able to open and functioned properly.  On a side note, if you use this case, the camera will fit inside the leather strap case designed for this camera, but that case will not close with this case on the camera.  I ended up not using the case as it was a pain to turn the camera on and off."
Did not protect my screen from a 2 foot fall.  Phone slid off a couch and dropped flatly onto a tile floor.  Short drop overwhelmed the tiny lip over the screen and uniformly shattered the screen.  Repair of $109 at Apple Store.
"Very, Very Happy. Arrived on Time. Nothing bad to said."
Good product<br />Easy to put on my phone<br />Keeps all functionality of my phone
"I opened up a support case with Plantronics asking for a battery replacement. Well the warranty life is only 1 year, so basically, throw it out or buy a new one is the official answer. The battery will start dying down after a while. This was my second unit. I would recommend looking at other products.I don't think anyone wants to buy a headset brand that need a new replacement every years!"
Fits my IPhone 6 + perfectly & for the price the quality is unbeatable.. Love this case
"fast shipment, great quality for the price."
"I find the inner case fine,  but the belt clip is made of very thin plastic.  The first one broke in a week and the company gladly replaced it, but I feel it should be made of a heavy duty plastic.  To alleviate breakage I leave the phone in the belt clip and just take the whole thing off of my belt to use it."
Nice looking case.  It has a very smooth surface which has caused me to nearly drop my phone a couple of times.  I don't use the stand as often as I thought I would.
"Can not get it to charge can not get it to work, waste of money"
"my husband is always losing his wallet, so I did some research and ordered this for him. It has many great reviews. Since receiving this tracker, he has lost his wallet once and was able to quickly log into his phone and trace its location. Thankfully it wasn't far and he was able to locate it quickly. The device also has a setting that will alert you if your wallet and phone be come separated, which would be GREAT for a night out. Overall, I recommend this gadget to anyone who misplaces their wallet regularly. It's a tad bulky, but totally worth it."
It's one of those loose fitting cases with soft rubber. It offers medium level protection which isn't bad for the price
One out of the three has already stopped working after a week!<br />Wrote a request and asked if it can be replaced but haven't heard anything back? Think I'm just going to throw the other possible fire hazards away and eat my loss.dont buy
"Cute, cute, and perfect for the 7&#34; tablet I ordered to go in it!"
"Side piece of case broke as soon as I put it on :/ Nice case, but disappointed in that. Cute colors."
I am so disappointed buying this. Immediately saw a big bubble in the case right after I put it on. I used to have the exact same one from another supplier and it lasted me months until my phone got stolen so I know how long it's suppose to last.
"You get what you pay for on this one.  Unfortunately, they feel really lightweight and cheap, and the stylus only works when fully upright.  You can't hold it at an angle.  Worse (and shame on me for not catching it in the description), the ink in all of these is black.  I don't know that I've ever owned a pen with bright colors like these that only write in black.  Oddly disappointing."
"So I love the quick charge! I'd give that a 5/5 stars, but the problem with this is not the charging, it's the durability.<br /><br />I just started using this and on the third night my phone slipped off of my desk and the smaller part of the cable got bent and was almost all the way out. It won't charge anymore and I can't fix it. Also, most other cables aren't compatible for quick charge, so now I'm out a damn good charger.<br /><br />So for the durability I gave it a 1/5 star and the average came out to 3/5 stars."
"Good sturdy case, took my toddler over a month to break it. Considering she usually only takes a week or two, I'd say that's pretty decent quality for the price."
Works as expected.  Charges my phone better than the stock Samsung cable.
"UPDATE: After owning this for some time, I will upgrade from a 2 star to a 4 star. The quality is great, it has had no issues and it still looks brand new. I would give it 5 stars if they would have sent me what they send they would.<br /><br />Ok. I think this product is just ok. I feel a little bothered that this product must have changed design from its first go round. This product i received is the one shown - however - if you read the reviews below and look at the images it is clearly a different band. It seems like version one was much closer to the Apple band with the magnetic clasp and infinity design. This one I received - no. It has a gap between the watch and the band and has a clasp instead of magnet. The material is ok. I feel some rough edges (very minor). The brushed stainless looks good but the clasp that attached to the apple watch isn't brushed as nice so you can see a big difference. It was not as easy to on the watch, but I did finally get it to fit on. Overall, I think it will work. I would give it 3 stars if the product was consistent with the pictures other people posted. My suggestion is to discontinue this product number and start fresh so purchasers are not confused. It is clear this was a different product before."
"I picked this case up for my wife, and she loves it.  Functional and stylish.  The micro-dots on the backing do a great job of keeping the case from &#34;clinging&#34; to the back of th device.  I'm glad that I stumbled onto the Verus brand.l"
"They connected easily via bluetooth and the signal and range was reasonable. However, the sound quality was too much on the treble and not enough on the bass making music sound a bit tinny. The form factor is poor as is the fit. The inflexible wire on the back of the head sticks out an inch or two making it impossible to use while exercising on a bench or floor (the wire pushes the headset forward). I purchased this headset with my own money and I returned it."
"Love this case, but the cord to charge, are you kidding me ? Way too short, need some length !!"
"Maybe it's just my 2 year-old phone being picky, but it won't charge my phone with my cord plugged into it. Seems fine with other's stuff though."
"I ordered the CD slot magnetic holder for my iPhone 6. I don't text or take calls while driving, so this is mainly for GPS purposes. The CD in my car is positioned high on the dash so this holder places the phone within my field of vision while driving. Instructions are included, but probably not necessary. It's pretty easy to figure out. I have the Apple leather case on my phone and the magnetic strips they provided fit with no problems. The magnets are strong enough that I don't really worry about the phone falling off the mount. The only thing that I would say is a negative is that it's a bit wobbly. When going over uneven/rough road, the mount does shake. That said, outside of a window mounted holder or one of the grippy pads on top of your dash, this will be a problem for any CD/vent mounted holder. It doesn't detract from it's usefulness. Plus, it doesn't obstruct my view of the road. Is it perfect? No, but I give it a 4.7 out of 5, which I rounded up."
Do NOT purchase!!!  The pen doesn't work and the stylus doesn't work.  The stylus was like trying to use a pencil eraser!  It was sent from China.  It was a package of two and neither one worked at all.  My money was refunded but it was inexpensive so I'm sure some people just throw them away.
"Its working OK - smaller than what I would have liked.  Its sticky on both sides - so it stays on the dash, but when I pick something off the surface, it sometimes pulls it off.  Its not as good as the last one I had, which I can't find!"
It's so pretty and it gets rave reviews but it's the wrong one.I'm going to keep it and give it as a gift. I will order the correct one shortly. Thank you all
This tripod adapter fits my iPhone 6 plus with the Otterbox Commuter case with no room to spare but it does fit securely. The product keeps my phone in place while on my Gorilla pos and other tripods. The Bluetooth remote paired easily with my iPhone and it came in very handy when starting and stopping videos and shooting photos.
"To be honest, at first blush I wasn't overly excited about this charger. Four ports with a maximum output of 5 amps (aggregate) is no big deal in an AC charger these days. Many newer Android devices (all of the higher end models) and many, if not most larger tablets ship with 2 amp chargers. That being the case, if you have four higher draw devices that you want to charge at one time, then this is not the charger you need. However, this will charge 3 high end Android phones (any I've ever tried draw a maximum of 1.65 amps) or it will charge four any model iPhones, or a combination of Droids and iPhones as long as the total amperage draw doesn't exceed 5 amps. The smart charging feature means that the charger will automatically detect the optimum charging amperage of each device and deliver no more or less to the device.<br /><br />Using a [[ASIN:B00KFS4Y1I USB Power Load Inducer and Tester]], I tested each of the ports and was able to maintain a 2.4 amp load on each port. I then left the load inducer on one port set at 2 amps while plugging in a Galaxy Note 3 and S5, both of which I know from experience to draw 1.65 amps when charging. I allowed this test to run for fifteen minutes and encountered no issues with the charger.<br /><br />To conclude, at the current price of $16.99 (at time of review) and Prime shipping, this is a decent buy. I reiterate that this charger will not fit everyone's needs, so make sure it will fit yours before ordering; but there's a good argument against spending extra money to get more charging capacity then you need.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟"
I bought this piece completely assembled to repair my smartphone and after several months had problems lighting and image. it was reviewed by an authorized htc agent and confirm that this piece was not new and was assembled from different parts (recycled) has no integrated lighting of the menu buttons they are at the bottom of the telephone circuit. the back of the screen that I bought has features of being detached from other phone and placed the digital touch him.
"its exceed my expectation, perfect material made of, quick charger for your electronic devices."
looks and feels nice. Phone has survived some minor drops so far
This cover meets my needs and price range. It arrived well packaged and in good shape.
"durable case, fits perfect on my LG G4. Design and colour is a plus, i love it. Its a flip cover that surely keep my phone safe. safe for bumps too and i can easily check my time on the circle window i found it amusing, elegant and unique design i ever got. I do have collections of case for my LG but this is the unique one, once i open the flip cover it automatically brights up and ask for my password. in terms of price it is not too bad. the last LG case i got cost me $6, i am willing to throw extra $4 if it is as good as this case.<br /><br />I received LG G$ circle case by Great shield for FREE in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review."
"case did not work, I went snorkeling with it and leaked a lot and now my phone is water damaged. I had to purchase a new iPhone 6 unfortunately."
did not receive the tool kit with it just led touch screen should get some money back for the incompetence thank you frank
"From the onset when I was on the phone with someone, I was told I sounded distant and quiet, even with the mic right in front of my mouth and in a quiet room. I would not purchase again."
"First choice out of all our headsets because they are small, lightweight, and swivel for either ear, but they break VERY easily. The pin that holds the ear piece together snaps off and they are rendered useless after only a few uses."
"I have an Otterbox case on my phone, so my phone doesn't fit completely in the holder, but it still is able to hold it while driving.  As long as I'm not going off-roading ( which I'm never gonna do in this car) then it is OK.  It take a few extra moments to get it to sit just right.  Would probably really easy if I didn't have the case.  right now I'm using the vent clip version.  The suction cup window/dash mount looks really nice and looks like it would hold securely. It has a sticky ring to help adhere and I'm a bit concerned to put in on the dash of how completely it may or may not remove.  The heat in NC might bake it into the dash  :)"
Great case that lets my iPhone color shine through.  It does get scratched and the bumper didn't come up high enough to protect the glass shield I had used for extra protection for the screen.  I removed the cracked class shield and the phone case has been working perfectly since then.
Its okay if you are looking for just a case. I wanted durability and something that protects the entire phone and this case didnt do that so i had to get another one.
I give this cable a 1 star.  It's expensive and still does the same thing other cables do.  The Lightning head gets popped off.  I got this cable as a gift and feel bad they spent 25$ on it when the outcome was the same.
"Until ANdroid can treat SD storage in a much more integrated way, the phone has a huge issue with being full all the time. Other than that a perfect budget phone. Just don't download any apps!"
"If you can spare the vent, this is likely the most easy and effective car mount mount you can get for the price."
"it works very well, the cord is long enough it fits on top of the dash board with the phone."
"Yesterday I really lost my keys.. I immediately looked at my app, and it showed me the location of the keys two days ago.. NOT HELPFUL!! I wondered why, as this almost makes Tile totally useless. Not sure if I should keep trusting this thing.. It did help me find my keys once when I couldn't find them anywhere in my apartment. That's why I'm giving it 3 starts//"
This Cute lovely Bear Winnie the Pooh is only okay for me.The quality is not so much good because it looks cheap.I can understand because of how the material made because the price is low at cost.It is not rightly fit to my spouse Lg G2 cellphone but she love the design pretty cutie.
This is great case to make a rugged manly phone look more girly. My only complaint is taking it on and off for use by the pool and with an armband to workout. The outside part of the case is very rigid and can be difficult to get into place. Instructions would have been nice so I know if I can use it in the water without risking mold and damage to the phone. My best guess is no because the material of the phone is made to repel water and the case could hold water in.
"The qi charger on this device is surprisingly quick. I use this for my note 5 before i head out to class and work. I use the qi charger when i have over 30 percent battery left because its much better for your battery life, not over charging it like you would when charging it directly. When you charge your phone using qi, the charging output drops when your phone reaches a certain percent. My phone charges from 50 percent to 100 in about 30 mins. Not a bad device at all. You could get about two to three full charge with it."
"Pink and bling, I love it!  Fits my phone perfectly, I've dropped it and it's been protected.  Came with a screen protector and pink stylus as well.  I'm happy with my sparkly cover, highly recommend!"
Excellent
Works very well. Workmanship is pretty good - but not excellent.  Well worth the price.
Works ok - Bought a Dual USB adapter to put in the top (As the side usb ports are useless if you mount in the console). Would not power the adapter and ended up not being able to use the product for the trip as needed. Looks nice - very sleek and small.
It works awesome. No other power backups cannot compete with this in terms of both cost and quality. I recommend buying this.
"I ordered this wanting to try the new hardened glass screen protectors, and it had good reviews and was on sale. The packaging was what you'd expect to find in a retail store, but like others mentioned it had no instructions. It didn't worry me though since I've applied various screen protectors previously, but manufacturers differ and I'd like to see their &#34;official&#34; process (which is, indeed, in the photos above). Nonetheless, application was easy using the tools included with it, and I was able to get a bubble/dust free application. HOWEVER, given the stiffness of the glass protector, it fails to conform well to he very edge of the phone, leaving a slight gap/ raised edge (see pictures). For that reason I knocked off two stars, since in time I can imagine dirt slowly making its way and sticking under the edges, eventually causing the screen protector to fail."
"I bought the TomTom camera about a month ago, and am very impressed with it. I'm an experienced still photographer, but don't have much experience with video. I have done various time-lapse shots of storms, driving around, etc. and have gotten great results. I took it with me to Costa Rica a week ago, and being able to transfer files to my cell phone without use of a computer is a great feature while away from home.<br /><br />I *should* have bought the full package at first, but didn't realize that it didn't come with the underwater lens cover which is something I wanted. So, I ordered that separately from the UK and it was here when I returned from Costa Rica. I played with it in the pool once, and was very impressed with the clarity and lack of distortion. I look forward to doing some more underwater work with it."
"We now have a year on 3 of these.  They are all still flawless.  Very easy to put on and we don't notice any difference in touch sensitivity and color shift is so slight it's just not worth talking about.  They've shared space with small screwdrivers, sharp mechanical pencils, keys, high powered ecigs and all sorts of hostile items too numerous to mention.....yet not a scratch on any of 'em.  I actually bought some spares and it seems I probably wasted my money.  There is simply no reason to replace them and if it ain't broke don't fix it.  I've found that Charmin TP is absolutely the best cleaning material for this item...........don't know why, it just works.  Good job Noot and Amazon....thanks"
They fit perfectly for my two year old and she loves them.  I only took off a star because they are still a bit loud.
works perfect
"This is a great case, especially for the price. I consistently drop my phone and have had no issue with the case coming apart or breaking."
"Upon initial inspection of the Protech case, I liked it. However, if you have a tendency to let things slip from your grasp this case will certainly meet that need. The hard plastic protective shell casing will more than likely help prevent damage if you accidentally drop your iPhone, but you need to take special care when you grasp your iPhone as this case has slippery sides. The lip on the back of the case is deep enough to protect the camera lens, but the lip on the front might not be and I wouldn't recommend laying your iPhone front side down. All of the port openings are good for access except one - the mute button port is too deep and if you have larger than normal fingers you'll struggle a little flipping that switch (I have to use the fingernail on my pinky to operate the switch). The overall design of the case is sleek, minimal and attractive. This case would rate higher if not for the minor engineering flaws I mentioned.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review."
"This is lightning fast! I love the swivel head on the charger as well. Fast charger, fast shipping! Definitely recommend."
"It is a good case but it does have a lot of flaws. They put the speaker in the wrong place, so the actual speaker on the phone is not protected the phone case is really really hard to get on and you can't take it off with out breaking the case and the silencer on the side, there is no way of turning that on and one more thing that drives me crazy is that the plastic on the screen that covers it is really loose so if you want to type you have to push harder then normal to get the right letters in but other then that it's a good phone case."
I loveee Pokemon so much and so this case is amazing !!! The drawing does not peel off and it takes a while for it to scratch and to break it arrived on time and I just love it !! But one small thing is that it's a little loose but nothing really big to worry about but I recommend it !!!!
Flawless! I ran into some trouble with my original port that just didn't have a good connection. Ordered this back and a charging pad.  I admit I was nervous after reading some of these reviews. Charged it today right after it came in the mail. Flawless! What a relief! Worth the wait of shipping it from China so don't expect it until about 10 days. But so sweet!
"Given To Me For An Honest Review<br /><br />Sport Bluetooth Headphone, Aukey EP-B13...by Aukey have great sound quality when &#34;sealed&#34; correctly in the ear. The controls are easy to use.They are real convenient to carry as they automatically &#34;coil up&#34;  when taken off. Included in the packaging are:<br /><br />*  Aukey EP-B13 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Stereo Headphones<br />* Instruction Manual<br />* Standard micro-USB charge cable<br />* Rubber ear nums of various sizes<br /><br />These are great to use while working out, jogging or just to listen to some great music.I love mine. These would make a great gift to give. We have 4 months until Christmas. You won't go wrong picking one up for yourself and a friend. I gave this item 5 stars but wish I could give it more because it deserves many more. I highly recommend this item to everyone."
The case was really classy with the finish and quality. Would have been great given the top of the phone is covered with the white frame too..It just looks like a bald head. But irrespective of that I loved the case very much. Would definitely suggest to a friend
Protects my iphone 6 from falls and my toddler! Great product
"Nice and small profile, provides a decent bit of grip. Not super protective, but seems to be holding up well 6 months later."
This works great and the strap is comfortable and holds on snug during any type of workout. I do think it is over priced considering the materials to make this isn't much.
"Great product!  Very happy with this purchase.  Excellent for frequent travelers who need to share a AC outlet with a lamp etc plus also want to plug in your phone, ipad, Apple watch, external batter and toothbrush.  It works great!"
These are so cute and seem to work very well!  My granddaughters love them and I have fun with them too!
This is one of those products that you never feel too guilty buying because of the price but that being said it didn't last more than a couple of uses and i can't see this being the best option at any point or for any purpose
"I bought this phone from &#34;232Tech&#34;, they get 5 stars because the order was completed successfully and delivery was sooner than expected<br /><br />So far, the product meets the expectation... a simple Blackberry to keep Grandma in touch via Skype and WhatsApp."
Although lots of people liked it. It did not work with me. I charged it and connected it to my iPhone 6. It worked first then stopped working the second day. Whatever I tried I wasn't able to turn it on anymore.
"exactly as expected, good for travel and extended use of navigation"
Love this case so far although I thought it came with a back not just a screen protector for the back of the phone.
"Perfect smartphone. Bit large for first time users but once you get used to it, you can't look back. The QHD screen is a treat to the eyes. The icons and text look amazingly clear. Amoled screen makes it even better. The camera quality is great as well. The body of phone is very appealing, with metal edges. I bought two of them. One white 64gb and the 32gb blue. The new updated price of Nexus 6 is more apt. I bought the Nexus 6 64gb at the original price of 699$ which i now believe was overpriced for it.<br />Nexus always has an advantage of getting first updates from Google, that is always a plus."
Sturdy and well made.  Great fun for parties.  A little difficult to turn the selfie stick off--you have to hold down the power button for a lot longer than you'd expect.  I wish the telescoping part was a bit longer.
"Its a case, it works and protects - my kid has not broken his phone in spite of dropping it"
"The plastic covering the camera slows down the camera's focus time, and the bit covering the heart rate monitor renders the monitor useless. You have to take the entire case off to use the heart rate monitor.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a fantastic case."
Wire popped out of the casing within 2 weeks.  Poor quality.
I ordered this case for my 6 but didnt realize that i actually ordered for a 6plus. Its a great quality case which si why i will reorder it BUT the right size this time.
"Bought this after my old headphones broke, WORST SOUND EVER! They arrived as I was going to the gym opened them there and paired them to my phone with no problem but the sound totally ruined my work out. It is awful, like if  you were listening from a cardboard box. Don't waste you money I ended up sending them back the next day."
Fell apart in less than 30 Days. Left earphone broke off. Held by small piece of plastic. DO NOT BUY.
Just an amazing deal for screen protectors.  Admittedly they're not super quality so they get scratched up pretty easily but they're so cheap that you can just put on a new one every few weeks/months and it still costs just about nothing.
"This product has an overall sleek, clean and qualatative feel. The performance and amount is perfect on trips where you'll be up and roaming around. Got another person or two who needs to charge their device? As long as you have the corresponding cables three people can charge at the same time; One though would be charging at a slower speed. The charger can be a hefty one pound but stick this in a backpack and it'll help. With alot of charging power, the weight or portabilty doesnt bother me as much."
"The screen protector seems alright. Mine didn't quite fit right, and because of that, when I put my protective case on, the screen protector's edges got messed up and now it looks kind of ugly."
Received as promotion. I'm a bit disappointed because one review stated that iPhone 6 plus would fit with otter box on. It will go in but not easily and I don't intend on removing my case everyday to place in holder. If it were a half inch longer it would be perfect. Those of you without otter box will probably love the fit. Once I got the armband secure on my arm it was comfortable but it took some time to get the strap through the double slots and fastened; or maybe I don't have enough coordination. I used it during my workout and the band served its purpose so I will probably get some use out of it and may get used to strap difficulty over time. I will likely get more use out of this during power walks for the music and not use it during bootcamp.
Way more power than the original battery. 10/10 would buy again.
"I would give 5 stars however if these obtain any kind of distance from my phone, the music or conversation either stops or breaks real bad."
I just received my Kate Spade phone case and I love it! It looks exactly like the one in the picture and it is beautiful and looks and fits real nice on my phone! Very pleased!
I have an older Sony TV in my bedroom and this Bluetooth transmitter extends it's lifetime for a few more years. Thank you for such a great product and the follow up after sales.
"So, I admit to being a cell phone case junkie.  I probably have a dozen in my &#34;tech&#34; drawer for my iPhone 6 Plus.  But when I saw the Dreem case I was intrigued.  I waited several days of normal use to write my opinion and I can now safely say that this case really is a &#34;dream&#34;.  The folio is beautifully made and flexible enough to hold a variety of cards and cash.  Magnets work flawlessly and I feel very secure carrying this beautiful case with me everywhere.  But the icing on this cake is the second part of the case.  When necessary I can remove the phone from the folio and still have a beautiful and protective case on my phone.  The front lip protects my glass of my screen and the integrated magnets hold my phone securely on the iSwivel vent mount I have installed in my car.  I hit the jackpot!!<br /><br />I also forgot to mention another surprise I got when I received the Dreem Fibonacci case.  The packaging was so elegant I though I had received an Apple product.  Every detail was well thought out and elegant.  Their attention to detail from packaging to product makes this a go-to product."
The LifeProof case for iPhone 6 has poorly designed cover of the charger port. The charger cover will snap open too easily exposing the phone. It happened to me when I was kayaking and had the phone in my pocket just to find out later the case was leaking and my phone was dead. I used to have the Lifeproof case for the iPhone 5 and the design was much more robust.
"These little headphones pack a powerful sound punch. The sound is clear and crisp, just as it should be. These are comfortable in my ears. These headphones are just as described. They feel solid and are made very well! The audio quality is awesome."
"I absolutely adore Anker's external battery chargers! I had an older version of this battery charger and was forced to upgrade since my previous Anker charger was stolen. Instead of trying out another brand, I already knew what I wanted to buy. :)"
I wish it could hold more cards without it getting so stiff. Also the magnet could be a little stronger. Aside from that I really love this wallet case! Saves me from carrying a huge bulky wallet in one pocket and my huge phone wit it's otterbox case in the other!
"I find this product awesome though I have some difficulty in activating the apps for the messages to work. But once I got the right apps everything went well and good. I even ordered 2 more for gifts. The voice command is great, the volume and the sound quality is perfect. Ever features is working good.  Its worth the money."
"This case is even better than I thought it would be! It's a great price! The case is just like the picture and the color is beautiful. The case fits perfectly, the buttons are easy to press, and the two parts snap together nicely and makes it look like a one whole case. I don't think they will come apart unless you want to take the case off. They are snug together! Where the speaker and charger and headphone plug-ins are, the holes of the case are nicely carved around them all! Including the camera and flash and mute button. If you always have to take your case off to plug your phone to a big speaker (with an audio-in cable), with this case you don't have to! There is enough space to plug in with it! Same with chargers and headphones! As for protection, dropped my phone a few times and it is ok! This is a great buy, I do recommend this one!"
"These headphones are okay. The sound is great, but they do not work well for running or anything that requires a ton of movement. After a couple of months with my first pair, the bluetooth stopped working. Fortunately the company quickly sent me a replacement. I had the second pair for a few weeks before they fell out of my ear while jump roping and broke. I have not heard from the company since then.<br /><br />Pros: Good sound, good for weight lifting or low impact exercises, hands free<br /><br />Cons: Do not stay in your ear while running or jumping, easily breakable"
Great protection for my new Iphone
Excelent delivered before initial delivery date.<br />Works great
"I purchased this mainly for use on my iPad and it worked ok. I am coming from the Samsung Note series and there is really no stylus designed with the accuracy of the S-Pen. The point on the S-Pen is what makes it stand out. And while there are expensive stylus that try to mimic the experience they have failed in expectations of the writing experience.  I have also used the Bamboo stylus and companion app which was not even better than using these styli.<br /><br />Over they get the job done but if you are seeking precision, this is not the pen to do it."
"Fits perfect, looks great and protects my phone.  Gives you a good grip on your phone so that you don't drop it.<br /><br />Would highly recommend!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
"Big and Bulky, but this workhorse does the job.  When I travel, I want reliable and long-lasting, and this battery pack does the job.  The two different ports boast different speeds to charge at.  1.5v charges on a regular time frame.  the 2.1v charges like it's on steroids.  It's not discreet, it's not light-weight, but effective!"
"Nice case, however, it gets dirty fast and the edges broke off when I dropped it. Its very cheap quality."
Product was perfect for what I needed it for. It protects my phone and is easy to get to. The product was exactly what was listed on the Amazon site and Wydan was quick on their response to get it shipped. Two days and I had it! Thanks!
"This screen protector made all the difference in the world regarding using my Galaxy S4.  I put in on myself in about 15 seconds.  No problem and it went on as smooth as silk.  No bubbles.  When I use the swipe method for emails and texts, my finger just glides along the screen.  No friction at all.  So much better than my plastic screen protector.  This item is a bargain.  Love it!"
"I've been using it for a week and it slowly stopped tracking my sleep each night, now is not tracking it at all. It seems to track steps pretty accurately for me but definitely not sleep. I will be contacting the company but from other reviews it sounds like they aren't very helpful."
I have purchased these before. They work great and have saved my phone many times from scratches. Does the job and is easy to apply.
"I'm usually pretty happy with life proof but I noticed the other day that the protective area over the flash is broken? I don't know how long it's been like this, but disappointed ."
I can not get it to stream right. It is so annoying. I am shipping mine back. Maybe cheap but doesnt work.
Works great.  Just what I needed and shipping was fast
Durable but my wife complains about the color fading fast.  The kick stand was difficult to pull out and resulted in her breaking it within the first day
"Wireless is great!  Good range for indoors. Battery life is just a few hours, so plan on recharging often (not a deal- breaker).  Stays in ear pretty good; would have been nice to have a few more loop sizes."
The item works fine but is a little bulkier than I expected.
Works well. Delivered promptly.<br />Satisfied with product.
"I received the samsung s4 , charged it,  but when I turned it on it powered down by itself and the volume turned off and on.  I couldn't use it at all so I returned it.  Was very unhappy with this purchase."
"For the price, these were good length cables. However, they were fairly finicky when it came to staying plugged in and charging. Movement of the attached device could easily stop the charge, and one of the three completely stopped working after about 2 weeks. One works fairly consistently, and the third will only work if the device is completely stationary. Would not buy again."
Great for keeping track of my problem fleet drivers.
"I ordered these cables because I am constantly replacing my wife and kid's cables. These cables are standard length and the fittings on each end are molded on and have a firm strong feel to them. The cables are a nice rubbery feel to them. They don't tangle easily.<br /><br />I saw some reviews where there are claims the cable is slower to charge a phone or tablet. I did some testing and found that the amps are just slightly less than the stock cable that comes with an iPhone. I see the difference is not that much. The cables registered about .1 amp lower than the stock cable. Based on the results, the cable charge speed will be very close to the stock cable.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest review. I am grateful to be given the opportunity to review these cables. I find that they are more than adequate for my needs and they do as advertised."
I love it. My phone keeps running out of battery and this is the only thing that keeps it alive!
Excellent cable by Apple. Fits iPhone 5 or beyond
works fine i have dropped it from about 30 feet and without the cover my glass would have cracked but with the cover on it it made a mark on the cover but not the glass.
The phone was very good but I returned it. The screen came slightly damaged. May have been a factory defect. But the return was possible and everything was good.
"Easiest screen protector installation yet. Fit is good, however the glass does cover the camera lens. It seems to have no effect on the camera though. Feels like the phone's original glass, and so far seems more resistant to finger prints."
Definitely not scratch resistant. Anything resistant for that matter. Dropped the phone about twice and ended up having the entire side of the phone cracked.
I would highly recommend ordering from a different company. This product will not last longer than three months; suspiciously longer that the return policy.
"LOVE this wallet. Yeah, it got stolen due to my lack of attention, but when I had it it was great. It is a little bulkey, but personally, I like that. :D"
"Works fine but takes time for me to wiggle it around in order for it to connect correctly. If it shifts from a certain position, it doesn't connect.  Not sure if it's my car or the Scosche itself."
This was a good product for the price; however within days the black rubber was ripped from normal use.
Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
It charges just as fast as the OEM Samsung Fast Charger for my Note 4 and the prongs are positioned so they don't take up more than one socket on my surge protector.
Far better than any other screen protector. Doesn't yellow or dent ..very durable ..full coverage ..exactly like item description.
This was a great case. Received in a timely manner in condition described. Happy with the quality of the product.
"I ordered this on the 19th, and the estimated arrival date was September 14th-30th.<br />It came almost a month early.<br />(TODAY.)<br /><br />I got a white and yellow one, and it fits my iPod with its fat, bulky, silicone case.<br />I needed to use a TEENSY bit of force to get it in there, but its perfectly fine.<br /><br />If I had to order it again, I would."
Going from a substantial &#34;defense&#34; case to this ballistic case is welcomed.. My previous case put quite a bit of bulk and as nice as it was it was too much.. This case on the other gives me the same warm feeling that my phone is more than okay yet keeps it on the lighter side. Along with the rubber covers over the aux and power port make it even better..
"The product seems to work as advertised.  The red dot in the magnet is rubber and provides friction on the smooth ball bearing when it sticks, that's how your phone stays in place.  The magnet stuck to the back of my phone very well but the ball bearing mount did not stick to the dash of my truck.  I have a Tundra and the dash surface is a bit rough so the 3m sticky pad provided with the purchase didn't stick.  After the first one didn't stick I tried a second sticky pad and it stuck for maybe 15 minutes.  I'm currently working with the manufacturer to come up with a solution. If you have a 'somewhat' smooth dash this product would work great."
"The dual 4.8A car charger has been a lifesaver time after time. I don’t know how many car charger adapters I went through but I am glade that the past is past. This little thing is power because it can charge my iPhone quicker than any other car charger I have ever tried.<br /><br />I love the fact that it is dual port instead of one. Having 2 adults in the car make it hard to charge two devices simultaneously. Now my husband and I don’t have to work for each other to charge our phone.  The blue LED indicator is nice to help me identified that I have power going through my charger. Some car charger don’t have that feature and if it does- the blue light is too bright. I didn’t have any issue with the indicator light whatsoever.<br /><br />You can also tell that woopower make good product like this car charger, because they take pride in ensuring that they build a great product. With customer in mind, they had added the circuit protection, protecting over-current, short-circuit, over charge and over temperature. The company also included a 12-month warranty of the car charger. This is a great company that produces great product.<br /><br />*Received this product at a discounted price for an exchange for an honest review."
So far the quality has been great. I've had it less than a month so we will have to see what
"great case.... rugged, belt clip is very sturdy and after dropping the phone a few time, there has been ZERO damage.<br /><br />FOLLOWUP 1/2016 --- Ok so I have just purchased this case for the 3rd time. (June 2015, Nov 2015 and Jan 2015.  I have also lowered my review score for reasons as follows:<br />I still think that this is a really good case.  I still feel that the belt clip is still very sturdy as well.  My problem as been that the small clip that holds the phone on the holster as broken off twice already.  I havent put excessive force onto it when it has broken.  Both times, it has broken while I was sitting.  Im not sure what the problem is, but if they sold the holster separately, or even made that clip out of metal, maybe it would last longer.  I am attaching a photo of the broken holster clip.  Otherwise a great case."
My son loves his new case. Its a good case and will help protect his phone!
I purchased this battery through a daily deal. It seemed like a nice hefty battery pack and the digital display was a handy feature. Unfortunately after only 5 charge cycles the pack will no longer accept a charge. Too late to return to Amazon but I could pursue the 1 year warranty from Maxboost. Obviously it might not even be feasible to ship it back and forth.
"Time is an essential thing bc people have places to be at certain times. But what if you also had a reliable smart watch at your side? The opportunities could be limitless, you could call people through the watch on your wrist, late to go meet someone? Call them through your watch and tell them you'll be late. It'll all be possible if you own this watch, which in my opinion is an amazing product that can help anybody."
Exactly what I was looking for. Seller was great! Thank you!
"I played with the phone for a couple of hours after we go it activated on the carrier.  It kept showing the Eastern time zone and would not change the date format per the system settings.  After adding the Google account, it would not update the contacts or calendar.  Finally, it kept giving me an error when I tried to update the software.  For a few dollars more, you can get one of the other Dash line like &#34;C Music&#34; which I had no trouble with."
Was not cut right and was not happy at all. I threw them away because there was no need for them.
"I'm a little disappointed, you have an annoying noise as if a loose cable on the left side, the sound is not expected"
Great replacement part with perfect fit and color match. Repair done by gluing (with LOCA) the replacement glass back onto the LCD results in a strong result that looks and acts like new. Great product.
"It works well, charging my i-phone 6 perfectly. I like its design and  gold color, too."
"Did not work after only 20 days...and like most people, did not want to go through the trouble of returning it."
It doesn't  fit  the  phone.
This did not fit my iphone 5.  the phone pops out of the hard shell.  I wouldn't buy this again
"Purchased the waterproof case for a trip to Hawaii. I tested it out with tissue paper in shallow water. I was a little nervous taking it in deep water, but it was fine. I took it snorkeling but the plastic cover makes it hard to sometimes see how your pictures are coming out. Regardless, I was happy with the purchase. It kept my phone dry and allowed me to take some decent pictures for what it was. Not sure I would take it diving or anything crazy, but like I said, it did the job for the light stuff."
"In June we bought our KDLinks X1 Full-HD camera and we are so happy with it. Very good image quality, easily to set it up and to use. The mounting unit, windshield suction cup, is really great very easy to mount. We are ordering the second unit."
"Small-ish capacity, but charges my phone at least 2-3 times fully. Love the built in cable and charger. This goes in my bag everywhere with me"
"22ctech, USB CHARGER, 6 Port USB Charger, 60 Watt, POWERFUL, PORTABLE Charger, Rapid, Travel Charger, with Auto Detect Technology, Desktop Charger  FOR REVIEW<br />EXCELLENT  desk top charger,this is a great addition to anyone's charging  station or just take it with you; this thing is all around one of the best and most powerful combined. the auto detect feature is the bomb, truly glade i got this in my book it is top of the line"
Great quality! Got these for my 8 year old for her YouTube videos and there's lots of room to grow.
"I have owned many HooToo and RAVPower products and when I came around to needing a multi-port USB 3.0 Hub, I saw the HooToo HT-UH010 model and was very interested so I picked one up.  I couldn't be happier with my decision, as this hub is awesome!  It has 7 USB 3.0 ports which you can use for any device, such as USB Flash Drives, Portable or Desktop Hard Drives, etc.  On top of that, it has 2 additional ports which can charge any smartphone or tablet (1 port is 1A and 1 port is up to 2.1A).  This is something you don't see on a lot of hubs... only the more expensive ones.  The reason it's nice is because you can save space on your desk since your hub can act a desktop charger too for a tablet and/or smartphone.  I often find myself charging my phone while having other data devices connected in the other USB 3.0 ports.  Aside from that, the construction of the hub itself is very solid for being made of plastic.  The ports have adequate spacing, LED indicators, and it uses the industry standard VIA Labs VL812 chipset inside.  I highly recommend this product and actually am considering buying yet another HooToo product... their USB 3.0 Docking Station for my laptop.  :-)"
"Having the right amount of battery power is a constant essential for video shoots but with various camera, monitor and lighting systems it's sometimes best to bring a power solution that can work across multiple devices. The Kayo Maxtar 12V is a portable and powerful battery that's a great addition for your shooting kit.<br /><br />The Kayo Maxtar 12V comes in a compact, hardshell zipper carrying case and has a rectangular design with a red and black colorway and glossy plastic finish. It's lightweight with a minimalist feel. Although the Maxtar is meant to be stationary, it would have been great to have a 1/4-20 thread to mount it on to a small tripod or shoulder rig.<br /><br />On the top is a high powered LED light which has 3 modes (flash, strobe and SOS) which lasts over 120 hours. While it's not a crucial feature, it's nice to have a flashlight handy during a night shoot.<br /><br />A closer look at the accessories reveal a power charger, car charger, jumper cables, and various power connectors. One caveat is that the power cord for the connectors is short which means any device that you are powering must be stationed very close to the Maxtar.<br /><br />Nothing can ruin a good shoot than backup battery power that can't keep up with your usage. Thankfully, the Kayo Maxtar 12V is capable of multiple charges. It's high capacity cells can fully charge an iPhone 6 at least 4 times, a Samsung S5 about 3 times, an HTC One about 3 times and a Mini iPad about 2 times.<br /><br />The dual 20V 3.5A and 12V 2.5A is also a nice touch which is ideal for powering up small devices like an LED light or external monitor. Again, it would have been nice if there was a mounting solution for the Maxtar but some industrial velcro straps or zip ties should do the trick.<br /><br />Another interesting feature are the included 12V jumper cables to jump start your vehicle. While I didn't have an opportunity to test this out, it's a nice addition and much more convenient way to jump start your car instead using another vehicle.<br /><br />Overall, the Kayo Maxtar 12V is a highly affordable power bank that runs much cheaper than some other Li-Ion solutions on the market. Having this in my kit assures that I'll have power available if anything goes wrong - like an uncharged battery - which happens sometimes. Sure it's not immediately adaptable for video rigs but with some DIY techniques, it's a much cheaper alternative than standard V-Mount style batteries. The Kayo Maxtar 12V is definitely worth considering if you're looking to have an all in one battery backup solution for any situation."
"After going through a few waterproof cameras that were pretty pricey, & didn't even take pictures that were very clear I decided to give this option a go. I figured at less than $15 this would be a great  deal if it worked & if not then I would definitely be sending it back.<br />Well....This waterproof pouch is truly AMAZING!!! I was VERY skeptical & did not get my hopes up too high (especially because of the low price), but after testing as instructed I was confident that my iPhone would be safe. My iPhone 5S has an Otterbox on it & fits perfectly inside with room to spare. I could even place our seasons passes for our local water park & our USB (for transferring purchased pics. at the water park) inside with my phone.<br />The instructions said to put a piece of paper towel inside, close, & submerge in a sink full of water for an hour or more. I actually filled a large bowel with water, sat that in the sink, opened my pouch, inserted dry paper towel inside, closed it as instructed, placed it in the bowl & then placed a smaller bowl full of water on top so it wouldn't float up, & left it for several hours. Sure enough when opened later that day the paper towel was completely dry.<br />I will admit ... even after the initial test I was still a little worried, so I didn't use it underwater on our first visit to the water park. BUT I have now used this pouch 4 times (once a week) at our local water park, testing it out each time before going, & felt safe enough to finally use it underwater repeatedly. We took several underwater pics. & video yesterday while enjoying the water, & all of them came out splendidly without any issues whatsoever. I would recommend always testing your pouch before using it for your phone (as instructed) since cellphones are not cheap. Honestly, I was quite shocked at how clear the video came out! The still pictures did not come out quite as clear, but they are still better than the last underwater camera I purchased (& I'm positive that has more to do with my camera more than this pouch anyway.) I have no complaints whatsoever.<br />The length of of the lanyard is nice as it hangs at chest level, & if you like it shorter you can always loop it at the back to shorten it as you would any other lanyard. It's light weight, crystal clear, & at this point we have not had any issues with condensation or anything else even in the HOT Texas heat. I highly recommend this pouch. In fact I'm thinking I may buy an extra just to have when/if I ever have issues with this one.<br />I have included a few pictures so you can see how clear the pictures really are. I love that we can even see all of the little bubbles & movement in the water as my daughter jumped into the water off of her Daddy's shoulders!more to do with my camera more than this pouch anyway.)

"This was a great purchase. I used this on vacation in Italy with a European power adapter. I was charging two devices every night, one time 3 (all Apple products). No issues with charge time; no issues with heat on the charger. Plugged it in, went to bed, woke up to 100% charge."
havent used it yet.  but appears to be well made and durable.
"This product does not work. Don't waste your money & time. Don't believe the positive reviews written on this product, as it is completely false. Amazon should remove such products from it's site."
"I bought this USB cable because I needed to be able to distinguish it from all the other USB  cords that I have, and it certainly does that.  It  works really well, arrived on time and packaged well. All in all,  I'm well please."
Love the case.  Suction cup came out but still stays closed so that's fine.  Strange almost undetectable magnet or something inside lower flap door where credit card goes.  Not sure why it's there... but case does the job nicely.
"Love the concept, but it fell apart within 2 months.  The stripping along the edges started pealing off.  The cover for the card insert came apart so now the cards fall out."
"This case is great if you are planning to use the belt clip. I purchased it hoping that I could remove the belt clip at times and just use the case, but this is not an option with this case. I only kept it because the return shipping was to high."
The case protects my phone well and I have dropped it like 6 times and it looks in great condition. And plus is the ports ar protected. It comes with a screen protector which is super easy to install if you are unsure just look at YouTube videos on how to place it without any bubbles. The only con is the ports get dusty. And I don't like that the apple symbol is exposed like it's not really necessary.
not as good at the IPhone 5 glass as the black is not stuck to the phone just kind of floats.
"The &#34;genuine&#34; Apple OEM charger is not an Apple charger.  It worked the first day, but charged very slowly.  Now when I try to charge you get this message that it can't be charged."
"Update 9/19/2015: I received another power supply sent by Anker's customer support. It has been working great for more than a week now. They are concerned about keeping their customers happy.<br /><br />Update 9/3/15: Company has contact me to get faulty unit swapped out - will post updates...<br /><br />Original review: Started out fine, did great duty on my trip to Kenya in December. A few weeks after returning to the U.S., a port died, leaving the connected device with a dead battery. Now, two more ports have died, leaving only two working. Not worth the effort to return, just to get another that will die the same way (read other reviews). Ports die, do not buy"
"I purchased this as a gift for my mom. She's used it every day for a few months and loves it. There is enough space for cash, a drivers licence and maybe 2 more cards. She doesn't normally pay with credit or debit cards so that works fine for her. If you have lots of cards this might not be for you. It fits the phone well and she doesn't find it hard to use with the case on. The included stylus is ok, she doesn't use it. I think this case is a great value! Locally these same cases are sold for twice or three times what you pay here on Amazon. So don't think that you always get what you pay for because at your mall you might be paying more for the same stuff."
"Poor quality - lucky you get three, pretty difficult to install - first time I installed it I was trying to fix a bubble and it broke.  The second one was fine, but after a while it was scratched very easily.  The corners started bubbling up so I bought an ArmorShield - don't bother with these."
"I received this product at a discount in return for an unbiased review of the product. I was so excited to receive this speaker, I alway enjoy listening to music while in the shower, but it's hard to hear when the speaker is outside the shower. And the shower radio I had does always pick up well. With the Bluetooth shower speaker you can listen to what you want to listen to. And with the speaker being in the shower you do not have to turn it up so loud everyone in the house has to listen to it. I also used this in my hot tub, we could listen to music without the fear of getting our phones wet and it worked amazingly. The sound is awesome too, to be a small speaker it has a great sound. I was very impressed with this product. I highly recommend it!"
"I purchased one of these along with an Anker 10000MH battery pack specifically for a trip off the grid in a tipi.  I smoke an ecig with lots of batteries that needed charging.  I've also got an obvious cell phone.  The solar panel is great.  It opens up to catch as much sun as possible.  Even in the shade (which I was most of the time) it was still able to charge a battery and cell.  My car charging ports were all taken by my gf's stuff so I had to rely on my charger.  I used the solar charger in the back of my car while driving to place to place in full sun.  Even if it wasn't getting full sun in the back of my car, it would still charge.  The Anker 10000 MH battery pack takes about 16 hours to charge from dead to full plugged into an outlet.  I wasn't able to ever get it fully charged with only 4-6 hours of off/on sunlight but it worked.  Again, the tipi we stayed in was surrounded by trees.  We were in complete shade, yet it still charged for the most part.  It is rugged, although the grommets could have been placed in a slightly different arrangement to allow a user to hang it a bit better.  The little pouch kinda gets in the way...or if it was flipped 180 degrees, you would hang it while holding your stuff.  Overall, I was very pleased.  Went all weekend at a place with no electricity yet still used my cell phone and ecig anytime I needed.  Great product."
"Really cute case and it fits my phone perfectly.  Probably not the most protective case I could have bought, but it has stood up to a few minor drops."
"I have an old iphone 3gs that i plan to use it permanently as an ipod touch, in my mini cooper conv 2009.That particular<br />cable is the only one that makes my phone appears as an ipod at the central screen.It allows navigation through lists ,albums, artists<br />etc.Of course ,due to limitations of my mini's audio, this is quite an awkward way to explore ipod.<br />All in all, the cable does the job as expected. In comparison , several other adaptors for 3gs or 4, even for 5 or 6 iphones, they just pass the signal to aux ."
The magnetic clasp fell off in less than 24 hours of use. Super glued it back on. Been great ever since.
"Purchased as replacement for a cracked case, perfect fit, and nice to swap colors occasionally."
This one DOES charge an UP 1st gen
"We have several avid bikers in the family and all of them have used the clamp-and-cradle type phone holders that  mount on the handlebar and keep your phone where you can see it at all times.  They're handy, but what do you do if it rains?<br /><br />We live in an area with high annual rainfall.  Particularly in some seasons and particularly if you're riding in the mountains, a day-long ride is very likely to include some rain.  You can take your phone out of the phone holder and put it in your backpack or waist pack, but that kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?<br /><br />This innovative holder has a universal adjustable clamp that attaches easily to any bike.  Once it's in place. you can rotate the holder so that your phone is horozontal or vertical.  You can also push the red button and detach the holder from the mount.  Handy if you want to take your phone inside without removing it from the waterproof envelope and exposing it to moisture.<br /><br />The holder itself is a heavy-duty waterproof nylon.  The back is heavily reinforced and the velcro that keeps it closed  does the job.  The thick plastic &#34;window&#34; allows you access to your phone while protecting it from rain.  It's roomy enough to handle even the new larger phones and phones that are in a case.<br /><br />***** I was given a free sample of this product.  The seller offered nothing but the sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion.*****  Everyone who's seen this (and some of them are experienced bikers) has been impressed.  All of them commented that the price is right and that it looks like it will stand up to a LOT of hard use - which is what a bike-mount phone holder gets.  The seller must agree, since they offer a full year's warranty. The design is good and both the materials and the workmanship are excellent.  If you ride in the rain, you should consider it."
So happy with my case i so would buy from this seller again an the case came quicker then i thought i give this seller five stars an would recommend to my friends an family 😊
"&#34;The headphone have a great sound quality when listening to music. I've been told that I am heard clearly when using it during a call. The headphones are really comfortable around my neck, they're flexible and light. They also last me a long time until I have to charge them again.&#34;"
This little case is still around and in good shape. I purchased this almost over a year ago and am just now posting a review but the case is still in tact and in great shape. Thanks for a good quality product!
"Love this cable! Durable, no tangles, just the right size. Couldn't ask for anything more!"
"The battery arrived quickly.  Turns out the phone I bought the battery for was totally broken, so I bought another G'zOne, same model  the battery works, but it is thicker than the original one.  I can not use my charging station, or belt clip with it.  I can still charge it with the direct plug in wire.  It was very reasonably priced and had free shipping!  I will keep it for electric outages or when I go camping.  Please note these phones are not Labrador Retriever proof!"
"I love this case; and now that I store my wallet's contents in the same place as my iPhone, I have renamed the App &#34;Find my iPhone&#34; to &#34;find my wallet!&#34;"
The white portions of this discolored significantly in a short period of time and no cleanser I have tried would restore its whiteness. It now resides in the garbage.
Amazing screen protector. I've had it for over a couple months and still doing the job. Very easy to apply as well
Sound quality pretty decent and would have given it a 4 stars but somehow died after 2 months of using.
"Arrived  supper fast. .<br />Definitely Waterproof<br />Only downside was the cover is huge, other than that its a great product for such a decent price."
"Ugly fit...Bad fit, the phone wobbles inside...<br />OK glossy print at the back, but nothing special...<br />Waste of money and time!<br /><br />Was in the bin after just few minutes on.<br /><br />Will keep looking.<br />I would give it half a star if I can..."
"We charge 4 Nexus 7 tablets multiple times a day, and occasionally phones. This thing just sits there and does our bidding (as long as our bidding is charging devices). Anker is a great company, and they completely stand behind their products."
"LOVE this case! Hated my Lifeproof case for the 6 Plus-I couldn't hear or be heard, unlike with my Lifeproof for iPhone 5. Love this Merit case & for a fraction of the price of the Lifeproof case."
"Great little holder. It's meant for your car, but I also use it on my night stand to watch videos when I'm going to bed. It grips my phone really well. The only downside is the vent clip doesn't work that well in my truck."
When you put the battery in the back will not close and so it wont stay on. Im returning this product as it does not meet the requirements it offers.
this works great. leaves no marks on my phone at all. its very easy to apply and left no bubbles! thank you for making this a review product! i love it
"After trying multiple cell holders in the car, I am still stunned by how much better this one is!!  So simple, and so perfect.  Literally makes me a better driver, because I'm never &#34;messing&#34; with a contraption to get my hands-free setup just right --- the magnet makes it effortless. Thanks for inventing! :)<br /><br />June 2016 Update -- I have re-ordered these 3 times as gifts for friends, because once they see mine in action they flip for it!  Several of us had tried other brands that didn't have strong enough magnet, so were frustrating to use.  Thanks for being strong, WizGear!! - K"
"It is an excellent replacement for the one that came originally with my VIPER 5902 security system, which was fading out and the key ring fell off.<br />I've only had it for a couple of months, so it is too soon to know if this one will fade out too."
Used for iPod.  Works fine.  Makes taking a selfie easy.  Not complicated to figure out.
This case fits my HTC One M8 perfectly! It said it was going to take a long time to get here but it actually came like a full two weeks sooner. It's just as beautiful as the picture. I don't know why but it took me a little wiggling to get the charm to fit into the aux space but now that it's in it looks super cute! It looks very good and has an awesome price to match. And if it ends up falling apart in a few months then I can just easily replace it.
This is great!  Just the right length!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this item in exchange for testing and giving my unbiased and honest review.
"This product is really quite amazing. The case comes in two pieces -- one inner protective case that is made of a sturdy material, the second is the holder which I can loop the armband through. LOVE that I can slide my phone downward to remove it easily from the second casing mid-workout then slide it upward when I'm ready to go again.<br /><br />I use it mainly for yoga and dance; my phone stays in place and I don't feel restricted."
I love they way it looks! But the two things that bug me are the fact that it slides off when i pug in my charger or headphones amd i have a a gorilla glass screen protector and it bubbles on the side with this case.
Great Product and Service!
"Nice case if you are looking for clear protection for your iPhone, this case does it's job very well and it looks good while giving you more than enough protection for the average user. I have been demo-ing NewTrent cases over the last six months and they never disappoint, great build quality and very little bulk. This case is a steal at this price and it does it's job well, very well!"
"This a great Case for protection. The 3 things why i did not give it a better rating is @1 once you put it on,I can not get it off. #2 the on/off side button is very hard to push to turn on or off.#3 edge around the screen I wish it was less slippery. But for toughness and protecting your phone it is great."
"Awesome case! I have a friend who works at a cell phone store, he asked where i got it from, when i told him how much, he was super suprised and said it was actually really nice case!"
"This product works well for the price, I've tried this on my iPhone and my android phone, It took a little getting used to becauseit blocks out sound very well, The battery life is acceptable and I have ran a half marathon with it and had plenty of power left."
"I love the concept of this charger, but unfortunately it just doesn't work very well.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it just doesn't do the job it's intended to.  The charger is VERY position critical.  Your phone has to be just right on the charger otherwise it starts with the flashing lights and stops charging.  It charges just fine when the phone is positioned correctly, but the second issue is that it doesn't stay where you put it.  Any amount of vibration seem to allow the phone to slide down the face of the charger and move out of position.  I should have known that when they had a protective plastic sheet over the sticky rubber where the phone sits that there could be a problem.  I cleaned the rubber with a lint free cloth and water and didn't seem to help.  In the time I have been typing this review, my phone has slid off the sweet spot and stopped charging.  I am not jumping up and down on my keyboard.  My desk is not a board on a pillow.  I would have given this 2 stars since it does technically work, but when I come back after a couple of hours, expect to find my phone with a useful amount of charge only to find it has gone in to power saving mode just doesn't cut it.  I will be returning this charger and getting a 3 coil stand with a shelf for my phone to sit on.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />RH"
"TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED, BUT THE CASE WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  THE CASE GIVES MY PHONE A MORE STURDY LOOK."
Incredible screen protector. The technique used to apply the protector itself is just magnificent. I'm very pleased.
LOVE IT !  THE GLASS IS VERY CLEAR AND YOUR PHONE STILL WORKS WITH NO PROBLEMS. I WILL DIFFANTLY BUY THIS AGAIN IF I EVER NEED ANOTHER ONE.
My daughter loved this.  Thank you for shipping it in time.
Don't waste time & money ..this Tracker working  for  two weeks first time ..  I ask for replace item .. the new one work two week ...  just waste my time... hard for SYNC  and use the app ... now i try get my money back...  conclusion is really bad..  again I waste time & Money front MAY 03 to Now only work 4 weeks..  Really!!!<br />Malo Malo no pierdan tiempo y Dinero... solo funciono 4 semanas entre Mayo y agosto .. lo cambie una vez y lo remplazaron el segundo lo mismo!!
"This case is heavy duty as described, but yet it is sleek and highly durable.  For the price, I highly recommend this case to any other name-brand on the market today.  You won't be disappointed!!  Thanks."
Great price for a great case.  Works great and looks even better. I love that it comes with the tempered glass screen protector.
I have bought this item twice and it has broken both times.  I love the ease and feel (sleekness) of the product but it is not a durable product.
Not a a lot of great cases for the galaxy edge phone that are great for protecting the edges. But this case really does. I would love if it would protect the front of the phone. But very happy overall with is case.
"I had no problem pairing with my cell phone. Sound is very clear on both ends. I haven't listened to music yet.,want to save battery. I found out too late that the battery can only be charged approx. 300 times then , garbage. I bought them to listen to TV at night. When I get the transmitter put on my TV , I will update with the results. Maybe 5 stars, we'll see ! The fit is good . I have a larger than average head and I did not need to adjust the headband . I remembered that someone said that the band would break in the middle , so I slid them on at the temple and then pushed them  down over my ears , avoiding stretching them."
fast shipping . looks like picture
"I ended up cracking my old screen protector, and purchased another one because it was such good quality"
Nice ribbon-like lanyards in an assortment of pretty colors.  Fun to coordinate the lanyards to match my daily outfits :)
It works as expected. Very happy with my purchase
My father loved this case. Still uses it today. It's slim and easy to handle. Not hard to remove and replace.
"I have purchase a couple of competing products in the magnetic holder category.  Usually I have to be careful about the type of case on my phone and the way I position the phone on the vent-mount holder.  Not so with iSwivel.  It attaches securely to my big and heavy iPhone 6 Plus and has never varied its position, even on the gravel roads I travel daily.  Other holders have dropped my phone after a bump and rough spot.  No so the Swivel.  The the added bonus of the clamp for bulky cases is just so cool.  This is definitely the best system around for a larger phone.  Thanks Matrix!"
The vibrate switch would not toggle with this case. I had to order a new one. All other features of the case seemed ok.
"This case gives the Note 3 the sleek and stylish design that most people bought the phone for, but won't offer as protection that is as good as other cases such as Otterbox's. If you are really worried about the safety of this really expensive phone, you should consider more durable cases.[[ASIN:B00F9VRNJ6 OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Black]]"
I love the look and feel but I have gone through 4 cases in 6 months for the same reason as everyone else has posted. If they sold just the outer bumper for half the cost I might rate it 3 stars. Customer service was good but seriously....4 times? They need to sell the outer bumper separately. Poor engineering.
"The case itself is beautiful but the more I use it the more it breaks down. The flip over locking flap is almost completely broken into 2 parts and is only being held together by a small piece of plastic. However, it does a very good job of holding what I need for a wallet and protecting my phone from drops. There are better products on the market but this is a good starter case or for those on a budget."
"This case was exactly what I expected with the exception of the supplied screen protector. I had hoped that it would cover the whole screen, but it leaves the top half inch of the screen unprotected."
"Perfect case for the iphone 6, nice coverage"
Do not buy this case!!!!! I have a brand new iPhone 6 plus that is completely ruined!!! The bottom piece where you charge your phone is poorly made and comes open very easy!
"It's okay. Application was fairly simple, but it does not have very good screen coverage -- too large a gap between the screen protector and the edge of the screen, especially when compared to others I have used."
"It's adorable and exactly as pictured, but a bit of a pain to put on. It comes in two pieces: a flexible case and a hard &#34;backing&#34; that slips on top of the case. The flexible case is just a tiny bit too big so that snapping the hard backing on top of it can be tricky. Sometimes the edges of the soft case fold under the backing and which makes it hard to access the side buttons. If you don't change the batteries often then it's not a problem. But I often have to take the case off to switch batteries (I charge the batteries separately) and it gets a bit cumbersome."
"This product is certainly better than having to figure out where to put my phone when I am doing turn by turn navigation.<br />The only issue that I have had is that it does block one of the main vents for air for the driver, but this I can manage do work around because I would much rather not have to find my phone on the floor or in my cup holder when its telling me where I have to turn next.<br />Overall a very good product.  Works well with my Samsung 6, Samsung 5 as well as an Iphone."
"This case has a very cute design and it fits an iPhone 6 perfectly. The case is soft and flexible, so in my opinion, its good for the looks, but I'd like a more rigid case for peace of mind when it comes to safety. The case doesn't cover up any important ports or the camera, but does cover every side and the corners well. The case is easy to put on and take off.  This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for a review."
Exactly what I wanted....fantastic item and fast delivery.
"this is the best way to go, if you use a lot of time online or what ever.  great cover for extended batteries."
Works great!  No road noise from inside the semi truck.
Ordered this case for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It is very durable and fits his phone perfectly. Would definitely recommend this phone case to anyone;
"Didn't want a case for my G2 initially, but after a fall at work I had little choice. Looks pretty cool, has a nice sized lip around the screen of the phone, and is pretty rugged in general. It also doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. It's not slim mind you, but it's liveable"
The screw fell out of bad when it was on wrist and amost lost apple watch. The bad also does not fit in locking  mechanism easy have to force it
"I was at first sceptical about riding a Blu phone based on some review, but since we have never had a problem with an item I have bought directly from Amazon, I ordered it.  For the price it is a good reliable phone for every day smartphone uses.  It will not replace my Samsung S5, but it is a good secondary phone as I have one phone for each of the networks in Jamaica.  I would definitely recommend this phone."
"Easy to use. Charges multiple devices multiple times for several days before this battery needs to be recharged. I have charged iPhones, iPad, Apple Watch, and a Windows tablet PC using this device without difficulty."
"It took me couple weeks to shop around for a decent portable wifi companion that will set up a closed hotspot to share files with limited device.<br /><br />The set up is very easy. Download the app and within 5 minutes, everything is set. (I doubt if you even need to app at all).<br /><br />Now I have a wifi for my device and co-workers to share file and print on the go.<br /><br />One note - I do not need www access, just sharing between devices. This HD companion do have the capability to connect to www but will let it for other reviews to tell you the experience as my main use is a close wifi hub to share files and print on the go."
"This air vent mount for my Ford Escape is still the best design.  My vents are curved like in the product photographs so that my Samsung phone remains upright.  The cool air when the AC is on keeps the phone cooled down, but in the winter this may be a different problem.  This design also clamps down on  my SD slot to my PC, where I can mount my phone for USB charging.<br /><br />The clamp expands to fit a wide variety of phones by pulling the arms apart.  My sample looks solidly built in a dark charcoal grey.<br /><br />I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review"
Very tight on head and gave me headaches. Not loud enough to cover road noise and no noise canceling mic
"Best case I've owned.  Two problems though that marked it down a star, ordered the blue border but got gray/black and took so long to be delivered I almost forgot I had even ordered it."
"This cover did not look good when I got it.<br />Once I put it on my phone , looks tremendously awesome. I love it and other people ask me where I got it.  I have not dropped my phone so I would not be able to tell if the cover will handle a good drop.  Will update in a few months about the case"
"I am not a fan of this product for the following reasons, and each one would keep me from recommending this product to anyone.<br />1) The plug fits very loose in the power port in my car and it slides out<br />2) Cannot use all 3 charging cords together.<br />3) Using only the micro USB on my Samsung Galaxy S4 would not charge it fast enough to use the GPS while charging a battery that was low on charge.<br />This is a complete waste of $20"
"I wanted to love this, as my Galaxy S4 eats battery power.  I get less than a day of use, so the prospect of doubling my battery life was appealing.  With this PowerSkin installed, I now get a day of use without charging, which is an improvement. The trade-off is, the sacrifice of some protection.<br /><br />This unit uses an interesting approach.  As you can see from the photo, the extended battery itself is not attached to the PowerSkin.  You use this battery in place of your normal battery in the phone, then the normal battery piggybacks on this one, essentially creating a double-thick battery.  Then, you push the phone into the back cover (it will sort of click into place). Last, add the side cover bumper over the front of the phone and click it together.<br /><br />The pros of the approach are that the case adds minimal size to the phone. With every other power case I've had (granted, they have all been for iPhones), the phone slides into the case, where you push the cable connection into a built-in plug and the case has its own cable connection point.  This means that those cases are not only thicker than the phone, but add about a half inch to the length because of the plug.  This PowerSkin adds very little length, and you keep the original cable connection, which is nice.  Also, with most other cases, you have to manually activate the battery backup, usually after your main battery discharges.  With the PowerSkin, the extra battery essentially becomes part of the regular battery, creating a 5200 mAh battery instead of the standard .  There is nothing to activate; the extra power is just always there.  I don't really know how the batteries discharge (i.e., if one goes, then the other, or both at the same time), I just know there is more power.<br /><br />The cons to this are the case itself.  The separate bumper is plastic, which I feel may end up breaking too soon. When it's all put together, if you squeeze the sides of the phone, you feel the bumper flexingin and out.  Also, the back does not fully click into the bumper; it's too tight. If you look at the pictures, two of the corners have a little gap, where I could not get the tabs to fully click together.  If you do click them together, something else unclicks.  The case itself has not come undone, but there is that small gap where it is not clicked together.  Also, the whole case is a smooth plastic, not grippy.  If it got wet, or your hands were sweating, it would be slippery.  Since there is not a screen protector, you need to be careful not to drop the phone.  The case this replaces was an Otterbox, which was both grippy and had a screen protector.<br /><br />For less than 16 bucks, this is a good deal if you need the extra power to make it through your day.  I do like the fact that it gives you more battery life and does not make the phone any longer.  But, I think it could be improved.  Even at a higher price, say 26 bucks, adding a grippier rubber-like surface (like the Otterbox) and adding a screen protector to the side bumper, would make this a fantastic case, that protects your phone well and gives great battery life. I give this 3.5 stars (but Amazon makes me round to a whole number).<br /><br />I was provided a unit for an honest review."
"The case has a nice fit & finish and is as pictured online. I took a risk, as I wanted to slim down my previous phone's case a bit but still maintain protection. Unfortunately, this case appears that it would not offer the protection I need. The black &#34;rubber&#34; layer is fairly thin and not rigid, and the outer hard layer around the edge is not quite as rigid as I had hoped. It seems it would protect best if the phone landed on a corner or it's face, however a landing on it's back or side (against a hard object or uneven surface) does not appear to offer much protection. Considering the glass back of the Note 5 this is a concern for me. As a result I have reverted back to a more durable case.<br /><br />That said, case it great looking and those who are not in need of as much protection will likely consider it a great option."
This screen protector had a horrible &#34;halo&#34; all around the screen. I would not recommend.
"I bought first one 2 years ago. Configuration instructions were a bit clumsy, but the switch always worked. LAN or WAN did not matter. So, I bought 5 more. Two month later added 4 more... Now I have total of 10 at my house. And then Belkin begins to fix their bugs by issuing software upgrades. They would fix one thing - and brake something else, and so on.<br />Now I have to wait for list of switches to display their current statuses. At random time some will show off network status. I will get them connected after another refresh... It takes 5 to 10 seconds to turn them on.<br />I know what people from Belkin will say to me, &#34;It's your LAN network&#34;.... Blah, blah, blah... Like 105mbs with R7000-100PAS is not fast enough...<br />I think problem is Belkin's IT department; why don't you folks test something for a change before releasing your upgrades?"
It took a while to get here but the product is great.
"The little light blew out after about a week, if that lasted longer this would be 5/5.  I like that the light isn't always on, and for my phone (HTC One), it charges at about 1% per minute, much faster than most chargers I have used.  Love this thing."
"It worked great for my class's embedded programming display cabinet. I soldered on a power jack for a DC power adapter. The only reason it didn't get a five star rating, is because it doesn't explain how to connect audio."
Didn't work with my Galaxy S5 phone.  Designed for smaller phones with out bulky cases.
"My mom works at A hotel. She can talk on the phone as long as she stays busy. However, she can't hold the phone and work at the same time. I seen the iGearPro on Amazon and knew it would be perfect for her.<br /><br />  The iGearPro gives her options. She can listen to music or talk on the phone with it. The device is very small. When she wears it, you can't tell. Her hair covers it. It connects to her iPhone 4s quickly and has good signal. It's charged by a micro USB cord that's included. When it's fully charged, the battery life is great.<br /><br />  My mom really loves the iGearPro. I feel like you can't beat the price. I was sent this product to test and review. I am in no way compensated for this. I am honest when I say, this product is wonderful!"
"I love this device. Easy to setup , and always on. When I get into my car , my phone connects to it right away. I have no problem controlling my phone with it either. This is a must have for cars that don't have Bluetooth audio connection in the car."
"Initially, I actually really liked this light. The light is bright enough to see what you're doing pretty well in the dark. It holds a lot of charge...After the initial charging, it charged my iPhone maybe 5 or 6 times. It seems to register solar light quite easily (not sure how quickly solar light charges it...I've only charged it from the outlet so far).<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it totally messed up my iPhone battery. My battery used to last for about two days on a full charge. Now, it can barely make it through one day without me having to charge it again. This happened after charging my phone on it maybe 2 times and I could tell there was a big difference in battery life. On top of that, I can't get the battery pack on the light to recharge all the way now. I've had it plugged in now for over 24 hours and it still says it is only half way charged. I think this light will still be useful to have, but I'm upset that my iPhone seems to have been permanently damaged."
"The Colorful tree version of the S6 case did not fit the S6, it almost did, but the bottom right corner of the phone was hanging out just enough to expose the frame.  When it fell off my knee today (with the case open, as I was using the phone on speaker) that corner of the screen shattered.  No matter how much I have tried to fit that corner of the phone into the case, it will not fit.  A new screen on a S6 is $235, I am very dissatisfied.  The case also interferes with all of the chargers, including the Samsung charger.<br /><br />I have used these cases before on my S4, and I love them.  Hopefully, I can find a better S6 case."
stays clean longer and easier to clean than the plastic that  I used before. Easy to apply.
I bought this for my phone and I really liked it. This screen protector is very durable. I like that it comes in a pack of six so if you need more for your phone you can have extras !
"It's not the most elegant looking Bluetooth, and the rubber ear pieces don't work very well,  but the battery life is AMAZING."
"I like this case, with exception of white chips/marks showing up on my blue case. It also shows wear compared to my wife's Caseology. I recommend getting light colors to avoid this issue."
"Works great feels good in my hand, it has a tight fit that keeps its profile low, which is great for such a large phone, can barley feel the difference of no case and this one in my pocket. Have dropped it once or twice and it has done its job so far. I would say it was a great deal for a good product!"
this fits really well and is a great product. I liked it so much that I also bought one for an S3 we have. Very good price and service too
The NOOT battery charger is compact and efficient.  It works like a charm.
This was one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon to date! This charging case took my original factory battery and turned my phone into a super charged phone. I have been able to go over 24 hours without having to charge my phone!! I am a heavy user as I use my phone for work and personal and tend to use my phone to play music in my car as well as when I am working out. Love this case!! Only compliant is it could use more protection on the top and bottom of the case; perhaps a rubber outlining to provide more protection.
"I read a great review about this product on another site, and it's become the main charging hub for everyone, wherever I go. Very portable, and solid. I also bought of short USB cables to go with it. It detaches from it's power adapter leaving a short cable dangling from the charging base. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is, but it seems pointless. On the other hand, it doesn't detract from the overall functionality, which is perfect."
"I was so happy to receive the sample of the Micro USB 2.0, Magic-T 3.3ft/1m Braided A Male to Micro B Sync Charge Cables Cord Tangle-Free with Aluminum Connectors Part for Samsung, HTC, Sony and Other Android Tablets Smartphones [4-Pack] because with all children and all the adult grandchildren that come and go, we are always charging a wide variety of phones and tablets.  These four cords have been in almost constant use charging Kindles, Smartphones and various other tablets.  We like to get everyone together for family dinners and birthday celebrations so this past month we have had at least one gathering each week-end and these cords have been used heavy and performed just fine.  This is my honest experience with these four cords."
Love this thing. Allows me to simultaneously charge my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy Note phablet phone. Only occupies one AC outlet which can be a blessing when traveling.
"This item was EXACTLY what I was needing.  I have a Bluetooth speaker (jawbone) attached to my bike frame but it is difficult to access the buttons so I had been attaching my phone to my waist to adjust the volume but this was uncomfortable.  I now keep my phone in my bike bag and can pause, play, control the volume and skip tracks....perfect with this button attached to my handlebars.  For my bike that has a smaller diameter handle bar, I have added some electrical tape to the area where I attach the button.  Item is very responsive, is small and works great."
Inner lining of wallet ripped after one week of use. Ripped where plastic case is clued to the lining. Like the case besides this durability issue.
I purchased the cables ~6 months ago. Half of the cables are not working anymore...I believe loose connections are causing the issues. I have other Micro USB cables (different brand) that I have used for many years without any issues.  Update 9/13/15: seller responded swiftly to my review and sent replacement cables right away. great customer service. i don't know if new cables are better...so far the cables are working fine. changed rating to 3 stars (from 1 star)...  Update 3/4/16: some of the new cables failed after less than 6 months ... wouldn't buy again
"I followed the &#34;hinge application&#34; advice and everything went smoothly until it was time to peel off the top layer.  When I did, the real protection layer came off with the top layer. Needless to say, this first failed attempt is a good lesson."
"The device is not able to read fuel consumption of a BWM 120D which make the device useless at trip analysis. Also it reports a cryptic error code from the powertrain without any explanation what it is. In short - this device is quite useless for me.  I just realized that all other 5-star reviews were written on July 26, 2015 which makes them feel like poor fake reviews!"
"I'm very happy with this purchase.  My old iPod/iPad wires would constantly stop working because they would get bent out of shape.  This wire is flat and tougher, so I'm hoping it's going to last a long time.  I also like the 6 foot length because it's better than the short ones my Apple products came with. My son loves it so much and he has been using it for his iPad, so I'm thinking of ordering another one just for me."
Case went on with ease. Very good looking case feels very durable I definitely recommend this case.
"I'm very happy with the product. I'm no fool, I put a piece of toilet tissue in the bag and sealed it, and put a brick on top of it under 3 feet of water for two days. The tissue was bone dry. I then went jetskiing with my iPhone."
Use it for to send audio bluetooth radar detector alerts to my motorcycle helmet intercom system. Works great. You do not need a mono to stereo adapter between the detector and transmitter. You will only get alerts through one speaker (mono) but it works.
Connnected great. Static on every station I tried when playing music and on calls. I drove all over my city and tried several stations. Too bad because it was the perfect size.
Does exactly what it says on the Tin
"small convenience, but not easy in/out of vent, two hands operation, and tilt down if the phone is not clipped below 1/2 way, but my phone has button in the way"
Functions extremely  well..  The best case I have ever used.. Have not dropped it as yet but it is very well made and I am sure that it will protect my phone.
Bought it for my wife and she loves to be able to use her phone even if she forgets to charge it.
"I HATE THAT EVERY THING GET CAUGHT IN THE GEMS AND THEM GEMS POP OUT ! BUT ITS A NICE CASE ,, AND VERY TIGHT"
I got this watch for my wife's birthday and she is an avid exerciser.  She does not go a day without telling me &#34;I love my watch!!&#34;. As she springs to her feet because the watch reminds her she has reached her standing goal.
The adapter seems to work fine but the cable is garbage.  Seemed to be OK for a while but now unless I am physically pushing the connector into my phone it won't connect.  Several times I have plugged in my phone overnight only to have it uncharged in the morning.  I bought some different cables that seem to be connecting better for now.  If you buy this item I highly recommend you purchase some extra cables to have on hand when the one that comes in the package fails.
"Nice finishing, works OK with my Samsung Galaxy and I need this device as my car does not have a USB plug."
"This is the only screen protector I've ever used that went on with no imperfections on the first try. I've used it for almost a year and it looks like it did the day I installed it. So far, it's completely scratch proof and it hides fingerprints."
"I bought these due to my wife's stroke last year. If I am out in the Apiary or in the Shop and she needs me , these work Awesome! But as to the range of them being 23 Miles is NOT true. the actual distance with these in an urban setting with houses , trees and such is about half a mile if that . now if I were on the top of a mountain , that was barren of obstructions like trees and such. And I was trying to talk with someone at the bottom 22 miles in a straight line , again with no obstructions like trees or natural terrain m MAYBE"
Haven't had many problems so far. Connecting everything was very simple. One problem I have found is that the music distorts when something is being charged with the sub and the volume notch isn't the most responsive.
"It came on time and it came with the case ,screen protector , pen everything! . it fits perfectly ! And looks really nice and i cant wait to use it next month :)"
it is not quite as bright pink as I thought it would be but it is a great case and I do love it.
"Was able to easily use the tool to replace my band. I did bend one of the pins, so it was nice that I was able to use one from my old band."
"Work very well. Background noise is loud and I can hear my transcription easily. Unfortunately, I can not wear this type of headset long. The pressure causes head aches after long periods of use. I prefer the kind that hang on the ears, these are not as good for noise canceling. This probably isn't an issue for most people. Have tried a lot of head sets and this is a good set. I would recommend them."
The case  fit great but it had a peel off cover on the back that said please remove before using in black letters all over the case when I pulled it off all the words were on the case it was ruined so I had to through it away
"A quality design and usefulness. I have several cables attached to it for convenience... iPhone, iPad 2, Fitbit, and ports for more items if needed."
"I purchased this antenna and recently was able to compare the ability to receive the marine WX (2 meter) channels with a Nagoya NA-771.<br /><br />The mag mount antenna was placed on the roof of a pick-up truck.  With the mag mount antenna I was only able receive 1 channel loud and clear and 1 other barily audible.<br /><br />The NA-771, which is mounted on the radio was able to receive 6 of the 7 channels loud and clear.<br /><br />I then compared the mag mount with t6he stock UV-B5 antenna ehich also out preformed the mag mount.  I wish I had compared the preformance earlier so I could return this worthless item."
"This is a great charger.  It has two ports which will simultaneously charge two Samsung Galaxy 5's.  It has two more ports that are for lower powered units, but I've had mixed results with those (they won't charge the Galaxy, or an older Samsung Rugby, but have charged other USB devices).  I've used the high power ports to charge an IPad 4 as well, no trouble.  It comes with a decent power cord (4-6').  I bought two and use one in my travel kit so that I don't have to swipe the one from home every time I hit the road.  Quite happy with the purchase.  Well worth the money."
"The tablet is great. Lollipop is not; yet.  Stay on Kitkat  until  LG puts the upcoming Lollipop update through (5.10). It runs 5.02 right now. If your tablet wants to upgrade from KitKat, learn from my mistake, and dont' let it.. If you install Lollipop before the update, your tablet will &#34;leak&#34; memory. Music stops in the middle of a song (imusic player is Google Play) , keyboards crash making it so you can't type, and apps continually stop and then relaunch, slowing everything down. Trying to have 2 apps open in the same window is useless. I'll post back here once LG puts the update through."
I drop my phone and the screen crack because there is no protection om the edges..... do not buy it cost me $600 for anew  phone
"Rec'd phone 20 days after order was entered.  Works on the bands / networks / wifi, as stated. Better than expected battery life.  FM would be better if headphones were not required for antenna and if they used 3.5mm jack instead of micro usb/charge port.  Unit was rec'd 2015-0822 with an OS updated to Kitkat 4.4.2."
Wore out over time and the white faded but overall good case. Had drop protection unlike other wallet cases.
"Works well, not fancy by any account, but I feel that my phone is safer with this thing on. Doesn't help when the phone goes face down on the ice, though."
If you are looking for a better quality screen that the cheap ones then buy this. The tools are also much higher quality but you really only need one set.
I really like the case. I also feel it really protects my phone. Only reason I give 4 stars is because the &#34;glitter&#34; design is not realistic. Also the protective screen sometimes prevents fast keystrocks.
"I love it works great. It is convenient accessory to have, a travel set. You can keep in your car so you can take it with you and leave your permanent charger at home."
"Fantastic product! I had my bike parked in a bike rack that was near where a tornado was forming. My phone stayed safe and secure with no damage at all. Highly recommend this product. I suggest using a bluetooth headset for music and calls so that the case can be secure. It comes with adjustable foam pads to help you use it, which was a great idea."
Pay close attention. This is a cheap ballpoint pen with an eraser-sized stylus nub on the other end. No returns acceped.
This product is exactly as described & what I expected. Arrived on time with no issues.<br />Thank you for your prompt attention.
Got the case sooner but I don't see where it is 3 layers more like 2. You get a rubber case that's one and then a plastic  that's 2 where is the 3rd layer....
"This case is the bomb! I never had one of these leather wallet cases. I thought they were to big and bulky, especially for the iPhone 6 plus. Let me just say, packaging was awesome (this brand specifically, has nice retail looking packaging. The 3 slits on the side are for single credit cards. I saw some people were sticking 6 credit cards and had some money in the wallet case, and were expecting it to close. Um, no that will not close.<br /><br />For the record, all you really need is 2-3 credit cards on the daily and maybe a $20 bill. No one needs to stuff this case with 6+ credit cards and tons of money. This case is for people on the go. Personally I love it and will probably end up buying the pink one since I have a white iPhone. The leather and overall craftsmanship is great quality. I would purchase this again and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a leather wallet stand case.<br /><br />I received this at discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Nice skin case!<br /><br />This is VERY well made - tight enough not to slip, but not a huge pain to remove to swap batteries.<br /><br />It is far from the thinnest case out there - the Orzly case I have is considerably thinner - but is far from bulky and gives a little more of a sense of security from falls.<br /><br />The seams are smooth and there is just a little bit of a &#34;grippy&#34; feel to it.<br /><br />I recommend this as a solid mid-thickness case, not as unnoticeable as the Orzly, but not as cumbersome as folio or multiple-piece cases."
Thrilled with both items. Love the fact that it's compact and able to get a matching color to my Sony Walkman.  Fits nicely in my pocket.
"Very efficient service, the part is exactly what I need, no complains."
Great combo deal here. Chargers work great and now I don't have to bring the charger in and out of the car to home and back again
"This product is a simple yet effective way to charge your devices when the power goes out.  It uses readily available AA batteries and outputs the power to a full size USB port for plugging in various devices.  Keep in mind the amperage output may not be great enough for some tablet devices.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Compact and sturdy<br />- 3 LED lights indicate the amount of power remaining and indicate whether it is charging<br />- With a pack of AA batteries you can power up additional devices (vs having to recharge like a Li-ion charger)<br /><br />Cons<br />- LED lights are very bright and you'll want to cover them up if charging at night (i.e. in a bedroom)<br />- Package with old 30 pin iphone cable (vs newer lightening cable)<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product to use for camping or a power failure."
Came in today was brand-new and is the newer type with the flange thank you so much male type  The one in the picture the older one I will try to put a picture up but the new one has the flange it's not all flat like the one in the picture we just got 4 of them in and they were the right ones. New style better thank you so much<br /><br /> We use the  antenna for short distance not long-distance the antenna works well this and made for short distance it is not a long-distance. we use it around the family for short distances...  Thank you for the product .  We have no problems with this product.  If anything changes will update
A bit pricey but SO much better than that little add-on charger piece that is sent with the original device.
Decent case for the price. Much better wallet cases out there
"I'm extremely unimpressed with this product. I found the instructions to be very unclear, disorganized, and very vague, and the kit itself was very difficult to maneuver. I spent over 2 hours trying to put together the screen of my phone, with very little success. Additionally, the glass screen itself is very poor quality, and the display screen is extremely fuzzy. While it is great to be paying a portion of the price to get it fixed in a store, I highly recommend going to a store and paying the extra money to have someone do it for you, this is not worth the time, stress, energy, or risk."
"Arrived very quickly, very nice quality.  I would order again."
Piece of crap. I put in the first battery pack and it started smoking.  Per instructions.  Put in the second battery pack per instructions and it didn't power up. What a waste of money.
I got the matte for my s6. Works amazing. Highly recommended
"While I understand the reasons for giving low ratings for this product, I can't say that I agree with the fact that they are given.  When you buy this mp3 player just know what you're getting into.  It is a very simple interface, simple design, do not expect frills and thrills, but for $25 bucks what do you expect.  I went to Target and Wal-mart to find the cheapest mp3 player possible that had at least mediocre reviews, and the most cost effective one I found that didn't receive total garbage ratings was in the area of $40+ dollars, and it was in area of 3 out of 5 stars with users experiencing similar problems which is not something anyone likes to see.  I will admit that the controls and interface are a bit confusing at first, but nothing that I couldn't figure out after a day or two of use, and while you can toss a sim card in this player, it comes with 16 gigs and if you just use it for music, estimating an average song is about 3 to 5MB, you can fit somewhere in the range of 3,200 to 5,300 songs.  Definitely wouldn't recommend that many though if you're someone who likes to search for a particular song though.  Sound is surprisingly good, and can actually get pretty loud depending on your headphones.  For my own purposes, I get inexpensive mp3 players to take to the gym so its not a big deal if something happens to it and I usually have about 100 to 150 songs at a time so this player for me is perfect.  To sum up, I feel like you get much more than your moneys worth for a very basic product.  Keep your expectations tempered and expect at least a little interface confusion to start.  Personally I'm probably going to buy a couple more in case something happens to the one I have so that I have a backup for when I inevitably drop something heavy on it."
Pretty much the perfect cell phone mount for the car. My only complaint is that the &#34;jaw&#34; covers the volume and power button on the Z3C (not a knock against the design otherwise).<br /><br />The knob on the back of the swing arm also seems to come loose easily. But for the price paid it is a small concern.
I would not recommend this cable.  I just recently started using it - probably 2 or so weeks now - and the fabric covering is falling off the cord. Not worth it.
"Great case that is low profile and quite protective.<br /><br />Four star because the buttons on the side end up sticking out. I bought this case to replace a bulkier protective one, and I found that the button would get pressed enough to shut my phone off in my pocket. if there were little less material on the buttons, or even just holes to allow the buttons to be flush or recessed with the case, it'd be better."
"Definitely agree with some other reviews. Case DOES NOT fit snug. Issue is more or the sides not staying. One side stays, they other side does not wrap around phone."
This case is very well made and I will definitely be using it often! Has a great seal and a beautiful color. I won't worry about having it near the pool or taking it to the amusement park.
"I received this camera lens by GoGo Robots to review and I love it. I take so many pictures with my cell phone that this really comes in handy. I love the multi functionality of the lens. It helps with wide angles, like panoramic shots, micro shots and fisheye effect shots. It is really easy to use. Just clip it on the camera of your smart phone, I have the iPhone 6 plus and I have it in an otterbox, this lens fits just fine over my case. There is no need to take the case off and risk damaging your phone. It works just fine!  I like how easy it is to take on and off. Literally just clip it on and then unclip it off. It comes with a convenient carry case that fits in your pocket with no hassle. This is a great gift for any of your family or friends that love to post on instagram. It is also a great gift for teens that use a lot of social media. I love to have it on me when I am out with my kids because it does improve the pictures that I take with my phone. The lens comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, with no questions asked. It is awesome!"
"This is super cute, but the tail falls off. We attached a large cardboard to the inner side so it wouldn't slip out as easily."
"works across any phone which supports the shutter function with a volume button.<br />Apple, Xiaomi and Samsung worked flawlessly.<br />nice sleek and classy design, no cheesy colors.<br /><br />minor gripe about the swivel holding the camera as it felt loose...<br />but nothing some epoxy didn't fix.<br />great value for the price and with a free gift too, thanks!!"
"I don't know how others are claiming this is an easy install. It's frustrating, messy, and the little tabs don't stay down on the edges. I've installed plenty of dry screen protectors on devices, I've become quite good at it. This protector requires way more work than what a screen protector should. Yes, I watched the video, sprayed my fingertips, continuously squeegied and sprayed and squeegied and slid the protector around. It just kept rising off the face of the watch around the edges and wasn't getting any better as it dried. Steer clear of this crap. Wasted both protectors that it came with, immediately issued a refund."
Just what I was looking for. Great product for a great price!
The cable works great and was what I had hoped and expected.  Great product.  No complaints.
"Use this item for various things.  Have one mounted to hold a GO Pro in various situations, a security camera, and a GPS in a RZR.  This is the shorter size and hold items very securely and takes up the least amount of room of the double socket arms.  I also use the longer double socket arms where more length is needed, but I find this length to be the most useful for my needs.  Really like the adjustability that the double socket ends gives you. Use this with a Ram Tough Claw and your mounting possibilities are nearly endless."
OEM unit.  same that comes with many phones.<br />sounds decent. pretty comfortable.<br />good value.
Sound quality not as stated.  Great outward design but functional quality needs improvement.
"The Rankie cords are the perfect replacement for the the original product received with my pc tablet and smart phone.  My foster puppy has chewed through every cord while the devices are being used or charged. After a few bad purchases, I finally got what I needed.<br /><br />I mistakenly purchased similar cords from another vendor and although they seemed to be made well, the thickness of the cord made it stiff.  It affected the connectivity in a negative way as the cord could not bend at the connection point for consistent contact. Nothing worse than to find the tablet had no juice hours later.  This happened all the time and so irritatingly inconvenient.  Also, I mistakenly ordered the wrong length of cord and that vendor would not allow a return for exchange...and that item cost more than these.<br /><br />Rankie customer service offers service AND replacement or exchange!  The connection point on my devices are not damaged by a poor fit by a unbending cord also.  Why didn't I find these cords first!"
This item more than met my expectations.  GREAT VALUE for the price.
Great fit love the color. I'm hoping you guys come out with more feminine colors SOON! I love that the side buttons (volume/power) are all flush to the case and don't pop out. They work perfect. Definitely feel like it will protect my Galaxy Edge Plus. Loving the kick stand.  Thanks so much!
"TechSkin for Note Edge was great, but for S6 Edge+, it was a mess. Cut-out holes aren't exactly where it should be and both edges won't stick."
"Initially, I would have given this a great review as it went on very well and was indeed very clear.  HOWEVER, they said that the sections that had a wavy appearance would disappear after a few days.....they didn't.  I can live with that, BUT it was impossible to keep clean.  Every single touch leaves noticeable marks on the phone and needs cleaned constantly.  Even that could almost be tolerable for good protection, but now, about 2 weeks after I put it on, it just lifted off.  I would not recommend this product.  Very disappointed."
"great idea, it works well with the stand and all and it's very cute, however, it does not cover the screen properly! the first time I dropped my phone in this case, it landed on the corner and shattered my screen!"
Clip broke off after two months ! Have to purchase another Case from a better Manufacture.
I GOT IT FOR MY SON'S IPHONE 5C AND HE HAS TO TAKE THE CASE OFF EVERY TIME HE CHARGES IT.  HE JUST DOESN'T USE IT ANYMORE.
Perfect!! Fits nicely and allows me to access all the features while exercising or simply needing to have my phone accessible while I do chores around the house.
Half star really... convenient I think not cool idea bad execution.
I love this case! Ships fast and is very stylish 😻 keeps your phone secure. Isn't bulky feeling or feels like it's too much. Feels very slim and fits the phone perfectly.
"Excellent case! I have dropped my phone quite a few times in this and my phone is still like new! A little dirty around the edges, but still looks nice and protects my phone, which is my main purpose of using this case!"
A simple cable to add flashdrive support to an older 1st gen Xbox. It plugs into a controller port. Worked just fine. I ordered from STA Online and it was shipped from China. Arrived in just 1-1/2 weeks. Very satisfied.
Fits watch perfectly. Nice feel. Looks like the original. I will buy again in another color.
"I grabbed this speaker so that I would be able to take to the beach with me and use my MP3 player while sitting in the sand. For its purpose the speaker worked great. It is very clear, easy to use and holds a charge long enough to enjoy it for a few hours.If you need a good little speaker to take with you on the go I recommend grabbing this little guy! This product was given to me at a discount in exchange for an honest and accurate review.<br /><br />-H"
What a great product! Charges on cloudy days as well although obviously takes longer. It is durable as well having accidentally left it in the rain one day. My son-in-law fell in love and bought one as well.
In exchange for a fair review they gave me a discount. I LOVE this company. Love the products that I purchased!
Updated: This plug did fit my iPhone 5c (make sure to remove the phone from the case as this may prevent the plug from going all the way in) and it fits the iPad 4th Gen. This plug is thicker than the OEM Apple lightning charger and this is why it did not fit my iPhone initially while it was in the case.
"Case provides excellent coverage with access to all ports. Grip ridges on the sides give a firm feel when holding since the phone can be slippery without it. Not too thin or thick, fits in & out of a belt holster case with ease! Folsom is a trusted brand, can't beat the quality especially for the price! Color is richer lime green in person which is a plus!"
Awesome case. very durable and easy to put on. I recommend 100%. Bless yourselves with the fantastic case guys.
Simply plug into your QI compliant phone and you can use wireless charging block station insread a plug-in charger. Quicker and ensures phone stays charged.
Very good product for a reasonable price. Very easy to install and does an excellent job.
Great looking durable case
"Well made product. Arrived on time. Works great,"
"Not bad, the back case material is too slick and the case is a bit bulky.  The kick stand is a nice addition but not enough to overcome the slickness of the case.  I went with the Incipio instead and it was half the price."
It works great for my Barned &Noble nook. I've been using it more than a year and there were no problem .<br />Good product with good price.
This phone only for talk and text. You can't  save  anything because it's not enough storage or download anything! You can't even get picture messages!!! This phone is crap!!!!
The screen protector came with good instructions and a good little squeegee. It was easy to put on and didn't make a lot of air bubbles
"Good design, and worked perfectly for expanding the USB ports in our car, as well as in our camper. Getting two units with two ports each was what we needed. The only downside is that they seemed to charge a little slower when both ports were being used. I'll have to do some test on it to see if that was just perception or reality, but either way, it wasn't a deal breaker. Great job!"
"Item arrived on time and in good condition. No extreme complaints about item quality except battery charge is often difficult to gauge.<br /><br />The only way to tell how well charged the the headset is, you must turn it on, and a voice will tell you &#34;Battery High&#34;, or &#34;Battery Medium&#34;, etc. It'd be more helpful if it had a better gauge like on a cell phone to inform me just how much &#34;medium&#34; is, since it seems to be a variable between only a couple hours to a whole day's worth of charge.<br /><br />But that's a very small issue. Just make sure it's plugged in at the end of the day and this headset will last the entirety of the next."
Works well. On time.  Only problem I have is answering the phone. Can't hear the caller unless it's on speakerphone. Everything else is loud enough
Does not come with a regular size SD holder so you can put it in a card reader.  Lucky I had an old one.
I can't connect my new head set to my phone which is the Samsung Note 3. I Have followed the directions numerous times after fully charging the head set.
"I like the watch strap and ordered it in black. I wish the strap itself were a bit thicker. I have the watchsport space gray and bought separately the pieces to change the color to space gray where it hooks to the watch. However, the buckle for the watch is still bright steel, which I wish was also darker."
I still use the case amd headphones and stylus and i actually was glad i bought it or my ipod would be broke by now
"If I could give this a ten star rating I would!  This case is so worth every penny!  My daughter had this case on her Samsung Galaxy in a different color but same product.  She left it on the roof of her car and drove off.  A few blocks away she heard something fall and looked in her review mirror and saw her phone hitting the ground and breaking into pieces.  She was going approximately 30 to 35 mph.  She pulled over and retrieved the parts.  The phone case itself came apart in two pieces.  The backing came off and the frame also had separated. The back cover to her phone had popped off and the battery came out.  She collected all the pieces and put her phone back together.  To her amazement the phone still was in perfect working condition and there was only a tiny scratch on the corner of the phone.  The phone case backing did break and was unusable, but she could still put the phone case frame back on her phone.  We ordered another one of these cases.  This clearly is a superior product and we are very happy with the results!!!!!  It is recommended that you don't leave your phone on top of your car!  This case is sturdy and protects and cushions your phone."
"Just recently purchased an iPhone 6 + and encapsulated it within Spigen' grasp. Great feel, great fit, protection yet to experience. Time will tell."
"Works as intended, great product.  2012 WRX."
the radio  still  does  not work  with it
"Installed this unit in my 2005 Ford Mustang replacing stock Shaker 500 system.  Am quite satisfied with the performance and features of the unit for the price.  I added the Sirius XM tuner which plugs directly into the Jensen unit - no fuss here.  Overall, the Jensen vx7020 is a nice technology upgrade and an easy way to modernize my 10-year old car.  Used the recommended Metra wiring harness, mounting kit and 12v-to-5v power filter.  As others mentioned, the mounting kit did NOT include screws, so I had to scrounge the garage for self tapping short screws to make that work.  Backup camera for $15 is the real treat here!  The unit supports backup camera display when car is shifted into reverse.  This was worth the effort to upgrade and install alone.  It does not have backup sensors to warn of approaching objects, but the visual is a great and frankly unexpected addition."
"Fits my galaxy alpha perfectly and is easy to apply, also came with alcohol pad and micro fiber cloth to clean screen before applying."
"Product came on time, and looked great! Unfortunately the kicker was too big."
My arm is not super skinny but I am petite and this does not stay on my arm bc there is not enough velcrow when I wrap it.
"Love it!  It's not as detailed as the picture online, though.  The owls aren't as pronounced, but I still like it!"
"Good looking product. Too thin to protect from drops, but good enough for basic scratch protector. Very thin product. Port covers off great feature."
"I Got The My Case , I Really Love The Color And The Look It Has To My Phone . i Also Love How Quick It Came In The Mail😍😍😊"
"Pros:<br />Attractive<br />Does not add bulk to Phone<br />Wireless charging still works.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not provide addaquete protection.<br /><br />I was using this case plus a tempered glass screen protector. A drop from 3 feet struck the corner. When I pucked up the phone the front and glass back were fine but the rear camera lens was shattered. Nothing struck the lens directly. While the front and back glass (being Gorilla Glass) may be tough enough to permit a slim case, the camera lens on the Note 5 simply requires a case that absorbs more inpact to keep the camera from breaking."
Purchased two of these cable for our iPhones and they work like a charm.  Very pleased with the purchase.
"This was a SAMPLE case that was sent to me for testing / review. I simply love these cases and appreciate the workmanship and design. They are not Bulky, they are nice and slim. The fact that the back can be interchanged with a different color is a big plus because after a while, everyone likes change, the gray and gold look pretty good as well. The Buttons are nice and accessible and the openings are sufficient for camera, charging port and the headphone jack. Would I recommend this? Yes I had purchased one of these for my Galaxy S5 because of the quality."
"Charger will not fit with case on unless it is the original charger that came with phone. I have only had the case for a month or less, it has already started falling apart, cheap plastic"
Very secure and protective for my Galaxy s5 active. Clip works great and a belt loop when more security is needed.
"We got our phones at the same time and I bought a Sahara case and my wife some other brand. Mine is still in perfect condition and hers is is falling apart. We just got a Sahara case for her iPhone 6. Fits perfectly, the glass shield is easy to apply with no bubbles underneath Fter installation. A good well priced product that meets the claims of the manufacturer."
It works as advertising.
Weight of phone drags down vent. In my van it gave me no angle to see it reasonably. Returned
One star deduction for my own effort to file a small notch on the armband case to be able to fully insert my earpod jack on the phone. Completely satisfied with the rest.
"So far they have been wonderful.  Over time it will be tested.  I walk normally everyday and use them, will try to repost after 6 month"
"Fast set up and easy to use, Very high quality sound."
"I've put several screen protectors on cells phones over the years and none have turned out well except these.  So far this screen cover is taking a licking and is protecting my LG screen wonderfully.  The sheet was easy to apply and I had no problems.  With the sheets you also get a lens cloth and scrapper.  The instructions are clear.  For the price you just cannot beat it.  Coupled with the ASHIELD Protective Case and Holster (Gray/Orange), I am confident my phone can withstand the normally brutal handling I typically inflict upon my phones."
Got these for my wife because I liked the blue pair a lot. She likes them but hardly wears them because she uses her iPad speaker more often to listen to music out loud.
Good case very thin. I only didn't like how when my phone  was in my jeans I took it out and the edges are turning blue and it won't come off. Overall good case.
"Excellent cell phone case! Very attractive- sleek design with magnet closure, and protective too! Case is just slightly bulkier than I imagined, but I am very happy with the product!"
"I bought this AC charger because it is UL listed.  A UL listing means that the design and manufacture both meet safety standards for protection against shock or fire.  If your adapter is not UL listed it could shock you or damage your phone/ipad/mp3 player.  A listed product has a UL file number printed on it. Verify the listing by looking it up on the UL website.  Listing by CSA, TUV, VDE, or ETL are just as good as UL.  Unfortunately, a CE mark means nothing as far as safety. BTW, this charger works great !"
This thing charges my iPad and iPhones FAST!  Great charger...1
I like how it is retractable but the cord is small and comes off the track too often.  Perfect for someone at a desk
I used this to replace the screen on my cracked HD7 Kindle.  It was cheaper than a new kindle and the tools and youtube walk through and it was fixed 30 minutes later.  My kids and my wallet were pleased.
"This case is an exceptional deal.  It fits our iPhone 6 and 5. I bought 3 of them for my family for vacation at the beach.  You can still make calls, text, and take photos while protecting your phone from sand and water. It comes with a cord to hand the phone around your neck...we vacationed in Europe and the case with the cord was extra protectioon from pickpockers.  The case is easy to use and will protect hour phone from water and spills.  A great product!"
The cover is very nice and sturdy.<br />The clips holds it too snug and it is hard to take it out.
"Cracked plastic on lightning connector after less than a month, very poor quality."
"This case is awesome. I picked up one in yellow and the shade is exactly what was pictured. Feels great in my hand and the rubber wrapping around the front is firmly and snugly on there. I was even able to fit three of my cards in the back: license, debit and school id. Just feels cool to know I don't have to carry a wallet with me when I go to the gym."
"I love this iPhone 6 case! I get many compliments on the periwinkle color, too!!"
My case broke in 2 places the first day.  It broke in two more places during the 1st week.  This is a very cheap phone case.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because it won't protect your phone at all.  I didn't even use it for a full week before tossing it in the trash.  Waste of money.
I'd's everything I wanted - not sure how to store the pen. I get a lot of comment on it. One friend went online as I showed it off an bought one. Nice quality.
"I love this case. Very thin and shows off the very cool gun metal backing on the phone. You can hardly tell it's on at all.The only reason for the four stars is that it came emblazoned with &#34;made in China&#34; all over it. It isn't a big deal breaker issue for me, but if that matters to you, consider that."
These Radios work good. I ordered 2 sets of radios. One of the radios had a lot of intermittent static. I returned it and the new ones work great.
"I was looking for a pause button, this only had the volume which is also nice. But, with kids you use pause a lot."
Easy transaction with quick delivery. 2 of the 3 were excellent. There was a quick resolve to the one that did not fit. Replacement was very good. Thank you.
I thought this battery would be like a new battery however it has not performed as one.  I followed the instructions on charging and have found within the weeks I have used it that the charge does not hold any longer than the prior battery.  If I would have known this I would have kept the battery I was previously using.  Very disappointed.
Didn't even have this screen protector on for more than a day and dropped my phone and both the protector and my screen shattered. Would not recommend this product at all!!
"Finally a way to manage all of the cords for all the devices.  We have 2 kindles, 1 iPad, 1 iPhone, and 1 iPod plugged in and they are all charging!"
"Strap broke within a week, will retry to return it."
"[[VIDEOID:543e99d2c8200fc8a74415450499712e]]I got this stereo for my husband's truck (1997 T-100) because he was LONG overdue for a stereo in there. His was garbage. For the price, this stereo has a LOT of bang for your buck! This is the first touch-screen stereo we've ever owned and it was a lot of fun to play with for the first time. It's got tons of great features. My husband can easily pair his phone's wifi to the system and play whatever he's got on it or use it for hands-free calling(always a plus, safety first!!), or use the av aux input jacks in the back to connect his ipod. It has a cd AND dvd player! That was a HUGE plus for us. My husband likes the option to be able to watch a movie in his truck while at work. The resolution is good and it's got a nice picture. The touchscreen makes it easy to navigate, simple interface, extremely user friendly. It was a volume knob which is a plus. It's easy to turn up or down while driving without taking your eyes off the road. It also has a remote control, which is neat, but I am just hoping my husband doesn't lose it as it's somewhat small. I will probably install Velcro on it so that'll attach to the dash. I like everything about it other then one thing, I wish it had an aux input in the front. But, that's not a deal breaker for us at all. Just a small inconvenience. I highly recommend this system. Just make sure you know whether your car is a double din before ordering. I wanted this system in my 200 Cadillac Escalade, but I was bummed to be informed by my husband that it's a 1.5 din. so I would have to do some modifications. I was bummed! Oh well. My husband is happy with it and it's perfect for him and his truck! I would definitely recommend this double din touchscreen stereo by Pyle!<br /><br />(I was thrilled we were offered the opportunity to purchase this stereo for our use and evaluation at a reduced, promotional price in exchange for our honest and unbiased review)"
"i like it, but i thought that the case would connect to the phone like the expensive phone cases. oh well"
Ordered two and I got them way before my expected delivery date! They are stylish and fit perfectly I love them! The band that they come with is useless to me.
"It's ok. Looks nice, and for the watch it works great.<br />But there's nothing to hold on to the iPhone charger chord. Just a giant hole. I thought it would be more like a docking station that holds the charger up so that when I put my phone in its inserted. Nope.<br />I'd return it if I didn't toss the box."
Started out working fine. Charged phone and iPad. Then iPad stopped charging and two nights ago phone said it was not compatible. Now i have three cords that work on nothing. I got about a months use out of them. On the bright side they were cheap and fast delivery!
"Works great !  No complaints.  I give it 4 stars because the phone, while on the kickstand, slides if you touch it, and when the phone vibrates it moves around; the phone could fall off the desk or table.  The end of the kickstand (the leg) really needs a rubber boot on the end of the kickstand so that it will not slide around. I have no idea why there is even such a thing as the stylus; completely useless since there is nowhere to store it. I received the product in a reasonable amount of time. I am very satisfied with this product.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it will not fit my new Samsung Galaxy S3. I would most definitely purchase this item again, if this company had one that would fit my S3, I would certainly buy it !!"
"I really thought this screen protector was going to protect my screen. It seemed pretty thick and durable until the phone slipped from my shirt pocket as I bent over to sit (I am 5 feet tall, thus bent over the phone only fell from about half that) leaving the phone ( brand new) with two corners of cracked glass. Needless to say,  I'm not pleased."
"NICE PACKAGE. THE INSTRUCTION BOOK HAD TOO SMALL PRINT AND NOT ENOUGH INFO ON PRODUCT, HOW TO USE, WHAT THE LIGHT IS ETC. GOT SOME INFO ON LIGHTS AND HOW TO CHARGE ON THE INERNET AT THE ANKER WEB SITE. I HAVE NOT USED IT OTHERWISE, BUT WILL IN THE FUTURE."
I've had a [[ASIN:B001G5A4JA Small Aquapac Case]]  for my phone for years but my iPhone6 is too big for it so I bought this one to replace it based on the reviews and the fact that it should handle deeper water.  Unfortunately the latches in the FRiEQ case are far less reliable than the Aquapac and the first time I used it I had to keep checking the ground every time I opened the bag because one of the latches would fall out.  If I hadn't been so careful about that the phone would have drowned for sure.<br /><br />Now I know why the Aquapac is more than twice the price but it's well worth it.
I give it a one star because the screen couldn't even survive shipping...it was broken already.  by the time I got it
"I've been through many headphones and these are by far the best I've ever used.  They fit great and comfortable too.  Used them on a 15 mile training run then, came home and mowed and did yard work for several hours and they were still going strong when I finished.  Great battery life!  I've purchased a few things from this company and the customer service is beyond first class.  If you have ANY kind of problem they will make it right, no hassles and very quickly."
Just as expected. My toddler uses my phone to play games and it is holding up nicely. The stand is a bit difficult to get out but I would recommend this product.
"It's a nice iPhone 6 Plus Case and appears to be a good quality product. I think I would use it on traveling time. has slots to put your id and credit cards. Nice that it has a hand strap so when taking pictures if you drop your phone, you have the hand strap attached to your wrist to save your phone from falling to the group. And the magnetic snap to open and close it quickly. I love  the look of it and the feel. It is easy to clean and appears to be durable for long lasting. I love this vintage look. It's made of PU leather which is also described as split leather. It is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term &#34;PU leather&#34;) that is applied to the surface and then embossed.<br />I think this will be durable enough to last a long time, but I will have to determine that over time.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
"These cables are much lower in cost than the apple brand,but they work wonderfully!Apple certified.Work great!!!!"
"This is a great case for the price. OR, it's a great case that is not insanely overpriced! The soft/hard two piece design is very good for avoiding damage.  I like the kickstand, wish it was about 1/2 inch longer, making the unit stand more vertical.  All of the small holes line up just right. Don't spend $40 for a hip dude case, unless you just really like paying too much."
"Saved my phone, cracked the screen protector but glass was fine."
"The i-Blason Galaxy Note 5 Case, Clip Holster Combo with Kickstand comes in two main parts: 1) Note 5 case with folding kickstand, and 2) Slide-in holster with belt clip.<br /><br />I will concentrate my review mostly on the case, as I will not be using the holster. The reason I stopped using holsters long ago is that my job requires physical labor - and in my past experience the holstered phone will always get caught/hooked on something and my expensive cell phone smart or not - will come flying off in a slow motion death crash!  I will say that when I tested the holster, the cased Note 5 slid in and out quite easily.<br /><br />The black case and holster are thin rigid plastic with an attractive but subtle texture design. I was attracted to this case mainly because of the option to use a stand.  I had another smart phone that had this feature built-in, and it was nice to use this when the need came up. The case fits nice and snug, snapping nicely around the Note 5. Instead of cut-out holes, (as used for the lens and light) to accommodate your volume and power buttons and plug-ins, there are open-sided cut arounds that work just fine. I prefer a more grip-pie soft feel that harder plastic feel, but it's not a deal breaker or anything - just my .02 cents.<br /><br />I like/dislike the KICKSTAND - it pulls out into position nicely using the 2 recessed indentations and snaps into locked position without much hassle. However, when you want to fold it flat, remember to use &#34;finesse&#34; as my normal (argh) gorilla pull tactic felt like I'd snap the stand in two. When the stand is used in horizontal or landscape position, the stand is off center axis and any slight push may knock your phone over.  Using the stand in the vertical or portrait position, the Note 5 feels a little more balanced as the stand is centered. As to be expected it is top-heavy using the vertical stand-up mode. As long as you are careful touching the screen, and using your other hand to support your phone the tip-over problem should be kept at the minimum.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&#62;Quality build, looks good<br />&#62;Case slides and rests easily into holster<br />&#62;Stand is very useful<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#62;Stand is not center balanced in horizontal/landscape position, may easily fall over<br />&#62;Stand snap back into flat position needs gentle touch<br /><br />This review is my opinion - and your experience can be totally different - depending on your applications.

Like the cover so people to my left can't see what I'm looking at!
"While I love the design, the plastic on the bottom where the speakers and plug-in fit were sharp and I could not hold the phone when texting. It was as though it needed to be sanded down during the finish product stages."
"Been using OtterBox on my past few devices and notice quality may be falling. The soft case of the Commuter I purchased for my Note 4 seems a little misshaped and distorted, as if it was removed from its mold warm or too soon. The dust covers for the earphone and USB won't fit tight even if I attempt to &#34;massage&#34; them into place. - This may just be my last OtterBox purchase... Sorry guys."
This is very much worth the money. This case seems like it should be about $50. One heck of a deal. Mind only took about 3 and a half days to come and came with no problems. The design is good and feels great. The screen protector is not so good but are very cheap to buy the good kinds. I highly recommend this case to everyone.
Great product. It's nice to be able to have one place to charge all of our devices without the need to use individual bricks for each device.
Great price! Great case! Perfect fit. Rugged but not too big. Easy to hold and easy to use phone. Provides a solid grip. Beautiful color.
Fits my phone great and can hold some bills and my ID and credit card.  I just wish it had a wrist strap and it would be perfect!
This case is so cute and it works well. It does what it is supposed to do only problem is the fit is a little too big and there is no hole for a camera so to take a pic you have to take the phone out.
"I have already tried several types of screen protector and all of them are a failure. A friend have used this and I thought I should try it. Im glad I did! It offers dust free screen, no marks and bubble free!"
Great. ! Mickey very adorable cute.
My case arrived when they said it would and the quality is great. I love my new case.
good for adventures and being out for long periods of time.  Use it to charge my speaker when out by the pool or beach.
With in two weeks of it being installed by a professional repair shop screen has white spots and in it. Also appears that glue is peeling away from side of screen.
Love this case !
"Cover was easy to put on and it seems to fit tight  All holes line up accordingly so there are zero problems with my Note 4.  I will use this cover as my everyday cover now that I put it on, I also bought 2 other fancier covers but like this one so much I haven't even tried them yet."
Great product and great service!
The pockets for credit cards are a touch too narrow.  I had to force in the driver's license and one credit card; which are both standard size.  Doing so kinda felt like this was defeating the purpose for these pockets.
I t works as ecpected.  It is larger than I thought.  It size is similar to my galaxy phone so it is awkward to carry around but will give a couple of charges to the phone.
NOT VERY BAD
"Awesome band, easy to install and I get alot of comments."
Do not buy this item.  Thin layer and does not look like anything the ad represents.  Ripped off  And the seller owes me a new phone because the hammer test is clearly draud
Very high quality. The price is higher than the cheapest but the quality is unmistakeable. The cord is heavier and the connectors are more robust. I like the extra length.
Great protective case!<br />I've been using mine for 2 years now and had multiple oops I dropped my phone incidents and no damage!
Very good product. Does exactly what you said. It literally doubles the battery. This case is amazing.
I love the animal print. I was a little unsure of the case but i love it. Very good quality and my phone is safe from harm!
This cable is poor very poor quality cheap made
"The case is wonderful, I did not receive the stylus pen.It will be great if you can send it"
Wrong size. No good description on the website
"I have a hard hearing with this.  I only use it in an office so it is not back round noise.  My hearing is very good, so it is the product."
Works great.  I have different types of devices plugged in and charges as expected.
Cable was a little short for what I was in need for
"This little speaker works so well! I don't like the weird voice that talks once you turn it on, but that's super minor. Great sound from such a little speaker!"
"Bought this as a gift for my daughter that is always losing her phone. Awesome deal. Bluetooth works great, easy to sync. Great for people that's are always working with their hands and she is always busy doing something. She loves it! Very inexpensive and now I'm the coolest mom ever."
Great conversation piece. It's not quite protective but it's pretty and crystals all around and the wine flows all over. It cracks me up personally. Looks just as pictured. I received this at a discount for my honest review.
Fast shipping just as described
hold phone nice and tight the rubber band stop phone from moving easy to attach to bike daughter love it
"Went on easy and works great! I have my phone in a wallet case and the credit cards sometimes indent the shield with letters, but it always heals itself. Also the day after I put it on, I noticed a bubble but remember reading that bubbles will disappear...and sure enough it did in a day or 2!"
Works well so far.  Will update if anything goes wrong with it.
"Needs to improve touch sensitivity, when i press for voice notes rec. only about 8-9 sec. Even pressing really hard."
Great when using GPS works great you can read you screen with no problem and 100% waterproof my phone had never gotten wet
"Showed up in a bag, not real packaging.  The case it's self is really nice, but the glass screen cover came broken across the top, probably because it was in a Baggie not a box."
"This DOES NOT stick at the edges. I was extremely careful while putting it on, followed the instructions carefully, and I have successfully put on 5+ glass screen protectors on other phones. It DOES NOT stick at the edges. There is a noticeable halo effect around the edge of the phone, even though this protector doesn't extend past the flat areas of the screen.<br /><br />Also it developed a hairline crack through the middle in the first week or so, without me having dropped the phone. Probably because it doesn't stick at the edges..."
"Purchased 2 of these cause they stated they were Adaptive Fast charging for my Note 4. Plugged them in, no notification that the &#34;fast charger connected&#34; came up... after about 30 min only charged 6%. An &#34;adaptive fast charger&#34; would of charged at the least 30-50% in a 30 minute span. My original has the adaptive fast charging logo on it. This one did not. Returning for refund."
"Protects the screen, scratches minimal so far, but shows fingerprints and smudges terribly."
"Feels incredibly durable, I got this to keep my phone protected and well I am very certain that no harm will ever happen with it in this case. The only problem I have is the latch that covers the headphone port it's a little inconvenient when you have headphones in while it's in your pocket. But honestly you can take it off so I don't really care. Great case very satisfied."
Love this. Charges everything for my tablet to my wireless mouse.  Have it set up at the computer and it works as advertised. I would recommend  this for anyone needing a USB port for charging.
This product does not work. I bought two and both of them broke within a few uses. It does not mount on to the vent well. The phone falls from it all the time.
Great case! Fits nicely on my Space gray iPhone 6 (4.7) and the cut outs for all the plugs and cables fit well. My only complaint is that casemate cases aren't necessarily worth 18-25 dollars but it seems to be pretty durable quality. My cat likes it too.
"The case meets the expectations , thin, elegant , and the price falls within the range of the competition. I am satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!!!"
Came as promised.  This replaces one that I've had for a couple years.  Really like the UP app with its Smart Coach!
"This mount is simple, portable and sturdy and well built. Its highly adjustable and I consider it to be a very good product for the money! It clips on and is very tight so it does not fall off. I use it for my iPhone 6 and move it between 2 vehicles and a boat."
"Excellent protection for my Samsung Galaxy phone.  The case is made of durable plastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've dropped my phone and the case has saved my phone from damage numerous times.  The only thing is, once it's on, it's a little difficult to take off.  You have to remove the white case first before you can remove the black case as it is in 2 pieces.  I guess this is a good thing but a bit of a pain if you have to remove it as I have, in order to remove the battery to reset my phone."
I just used the glass had a professional installation of the glass. Still have the rest of the set.
Flimsy product
"I purchased three different styles of the elago brand cases for my iPhone 6 at one time. Loved the color and slim fit, however it offered very little protection especially along the top and bottom of the case. Hard plastic and very smooth leaving no grip at all. Definitely would not trust it being protected if it was to be accidentally dropped."
"I love these belt pouches. I had one for my iPhone 4s, and couldn't live without it when I got my iPhone 6. I found that this 6-Plus pouch works perfectly for the iPhone 6 inside an Otterbox Defender. (The one for the i-phone 6 was too tight, contrary to reviews and answered questions there.) I like the way you can slip a belt through the loops, and also hook it on the waistband of your pants. I bought several of them, to facilitate switching between pants from day to day. By the way, I would think that the iPhone 6-Plus inside an Otterbox Defender would NOT fit in this pouch."
"Screen protector at it's best! This screen has a silky smooth feeling, easy to install and clear clarity. I don't notice a difference with the screen on, it feels and looks the same.<br />#1 Before applying the screen, clean all dust and debris from your phone. Use the alcohol pad and dust absorber. I took my phone in the bathroom then turned on the shower to settle the dust. The process took about 2 minutes  to complete.<br /><br />Good investment for your cell phone. This can save you the cost of repairing a cracked or severely scratched screen. I recieved a discount for my honest Opinion."
"So I have been buying Auvio headsets for years. The only time I have to replace them is when I loe them because they never break down. Auvio is a  quality brand with quality products. My only complaint is not with the product but rather with the seller and its packaging. Typically, when I purchase an Auvio product, I receive three sizes of earbuds. I use the smallest ones because my ears are small. But the one thing that could ruin such a great product happened which was that I didn't get the sizes of ear buds. So as I am writing this review, I have to periodically push in the ear phones as they slowly slide out of my ear. This is especially frustrating as I begin my first semester of college. First world problems are hardly problems but seriously D:"
"Love it. Great clear image. And the case is sturdy as while. Only one problem, the button above the power button is so hard that I can't push it and have to shut my phone off another way. Besides that, this is a wonderful item."
This is a great product.  I have used it for both my Note and my iPhone 6+.  It charges fast.  This is holding up better than the one I bought from Brookstone.  I've only used the wall unit.  I haven't used the car charger.  We've had this for about 8 months.
"So much better than the old versions of playing iPhone over the radio. Clear sound as if it was hooked up to the iPhone. Occasionally, it drops the connection especially when I use Siri. I just re-pair the device and all is good."
Case feels solid and fits the phone perfectly. Have not dropped the phone so I can not attest to the protection. The clear back is nice if you want to put a sticker between the case and phone
"Pretty good case but I feel that when I put my screen face down it will still get scratched, there's not a lot of room between the screen and the table. But gorgeous case. Design hasn't scratched off(yet)"
"This case did not protect the phone enough for me. I'm use to the bumpers covering the phone a little more. However the case arrived quickly, and was a gorgeous color and really showed the beauty of the phone. It just wasn't as much protection as I would have preferred."
"works well. comfy, fits the case too! iphone 6"
"I just came back on a long 6hr oceanic flight and the battery lasted the whole flight.  It's true that these, as labeled, are actually less mAh than the original battery.  I was initially concerned because I charged both the new battery and an OEM battery in another nook, then ran a looping video player on both, and after a few hours the new battery seemed to be a few percentage less than the original OEM.  I was thinking of returning it if it couldn't even keep up with a 5yr old nook.  However, after about 3 hours the original OEM took a quick nosedive whereas this one kept going with the same level discharge curve.  This is exactly what we found on the flight as well.  The only problem now is that I have to upgrade my wife's nook as well!<br /><br />I googled for a Youtube installation video and that was very accurate.  No problems following the instructions.  The OEM battery has a small buffer around the battery to fit the opening a little better but I haven't noticed any problem with this battery in the slightly larger opening.  The only trick I found with reinstalling it is that the triangular cover with the rubber straps sometimes won't fit; it's easier if you pull the cover out completely and then after it's closed use a small screwdriver to push the rubber straps back in - they fit one way and won't pull out.<br /><br />I think any 5yr old nook can probably benefit from this battery, but before you do that you might also take a quick look at your battery cable and connector.  On one of my nooks the battery wasn't charging so I bought this replacement.  It turns out that afterwards it still wasn't.  Upon closer inspection both the cable & port on the nook were damaged.  That's why the cable felt a little weird plugging it in.  In the end, I had to give up on that nook because there's no way to repair that port.  Fortunately I had another nook to put the new battery into."
Poduct seems to be of good quality but doesn't lay down all the way on my phone and leaves an air pocket on the uper right hand corner.<br />the screen is super clear other than that.
"Larger than I thought, but to be able to power items up to a laptop is a fantastic deal here."
They really mean that this product is a cracked LCD screen. Somehow I thought this product was to replace a cracked screen.
"Great fitting case, and clear enough to show the Lumia casing's brilliant color!"
"I use it with my Microsoft surface 3 to watch movies on long plane trips. I start with the unit plugged into the surface, runs movies with volume up for over 18 hours. YES OVER 18 HOURS. What can I say other than I love it. I don't write reviews, but just had to share my joy with this product."
"Pros: Great that its water resistant, back up battery , answer phone calls with it.  Good back up speaker.  Cons: sound quality"
Absolutely love the quick charge of this charger. Charges my moto x in about 40 minutes. I couldn't live without it now.
"Excellent quality and design rolled into a secure case that looks good too!  I really enjoyed the ease in which the case could be assembled/disassembled, but still felt very secure in how it fit together.  I feels like complete protection from the built in screen protector to the built in port covers, this case provide a very good amount of protection for the average iPhone 5 user.    After just a couple of days of my using it, my 17 year old daughter pursuing me so much for the cover that I finally gave it up to her to test.  She loved it the customization covers and, surprisingly, her biggest excitement was that the Apple logo shown through the rear of the case!  She said it added a little bit to the size of the phone, but after an hour or so she couldn't imagine her phone without the case - and this coming from a 17 year old girl!   Great design, excellent quality and customization.  What else do you need?!?!"
Works well and reliably. A basic dual USB wall charger.
"I use up battery on my phone like no other. I love having a couple of backups. Batteries work fine and charger works great too. No issues. I have charged the Anker batteries in my Samsung charger, and charged the samsung battery in the Anker charger. It is awesome to have a spare battery and backup charger all the time. Super pleased with this product."
"The silicone pink cover is a little loose, but this is a really good tablet cover for the price."
Right after I was accepted for the review I got my calling card credited to my account and the card works great. Would recommend to anyone
"i pulled it out of my ear and it snapped at the earbud, but it was okay while it lasted."
"The new watch band fit my 42mm stainless steel Apple watch perfectly, pretty much like it came from Apple itself.  I had to remove four links from band, which I did with the tool provided.  There were no instructions included so I used a video from the web, which was probably more useful than printed instructions anyway.  I was very pleased with the entire transaction and the watch band looks like it came with the watch.  It's also easy to change back to the sport band that did come with the watch.  Impressive quality at a good price."
"Product came when it was supposed to, which to me is very important.  It seems to be working well.  I've had it 4 months and it stopped working for some reason.  The return policy ran out.  Buying something else.  Enough of Anker!"
"Super fast shipping and it fits my phone perfectly. It was kind of tricky putting it on (it has the rubber case part and the single hard cover piece fits over the back of it and covers the side pieces a little) but after i managed to get it placed properly, it fit great."
Received sooner than expected and the product was good quality. Highly recommend
"It stopped accepting a charge after 2 months. When I plug it in to replenish its stored energy, the lights no longer come on and blink as they did when I first got it."
"I am really impressed with this phone case and holster.  I previously had one of the plastic shell cases and belt clip and that thing broke within 1 month having never been dropped once.  I work in IT and I'm always bumping into stuff while holding equipment with both hands, so the case needs to hold up while on the belt clip as well as the occasional drop from your hands.  This case has strong protection of the phone and it doesn't &#34;bulk up&#34; the phone at all.  I mean seriously, the iPhone6 is wafer thin anyway, so a little extra protection doesn't hurt.  The only drawback is the belt clip will swivel a little easily if you bump into things, but I consider that minor vs. the protection and ease of use.  I'm really enjoying it and I expect to have it for a long time to come.  Nice job BUDDIBOX."
"This charger does what it is supposed to do - charges my devices and charges them quickly. My favorite part? My cat doesn't like black cables, so I don't have to worry about having them chewed up on me like I did with the white ones. I would definitely recommend these to anyone else who owns an a-hole of a cat who prefers chewing on white cables like mine."
"I bought this phone in November of 2014, hoping that this would be the answer to my wishes (being able to keep all of my apps as further updates would surely follow the purchase).  Unfortunately, my wishes were smashed to bits. Let me preface by saying that I don't know how to nor do I ROOT phones. I have purchased several so-called 8GB internal memory phones only to find out that there isn't enough room to update the apps.<br /><br />And YES, I did experiment with moving (a percentage of ) apps to my added on mini SD card. Like every other phone, you can't really add the &#34;app&#34; to the SD card, but rather what you use for that app (photos, music, book prefs). I did all I could to avoid updating bloat apps (HTC, GOOGLE, etc.) to no avail. Before the last update that I put off for over a week, I went from 0.63 GB of free space to 0.37 GB of free space. That means that I can't update any blessed apps that I want to, like AMAZON, KINDLE, AVAST, SKYPE without either moving something to the card or removing app(s).<br /><br />It would appear that I'm not shooting high enough. Perhaps I need more memory, like what galaxy phones allegedly have. Problem is, I don't want a contract and can't afford the S6. That leaves older phones with older batteries because they are no longer made. Most of which won't allow you to remove the battery to replace that.<br /><br />I just can't win."
"I have had this phone for close to 2 months.  Up until a couple of days ago I would have rated the phone a 5, but the ringtone speaker stopped working.  I contacted Asus via eMail to find out how I get the phone fixed.  The customer service representative's response was illiterate and totally  useless information.  Now I'm faced with a dysfunctional phone as well as a seemingly dysfunctional customer service department.  I will update this review once I have resolved the problem to my satisfaction."
"*Updated Review* We had an FM transmitter I loved, but had to use an adapter and I was tired of it. We purchased this because of all the great reviews and I am shocked. There is constant static and sound when using this. I have literally tried every station from 88-107 and never found a clear station. I'm back to using my old one with an adapter. I know it can't be where I live, as my other one is crystal clear. I'm not sure why this one didn't work for us. ________ I was contacted by the manufacturer based on my review above. They asked if I would be willing to try a different product to see if it made a difference. I was impressed by their customer service--they came to me, I didn't even complain to them directly. I received the new unit yesterday and it is a completely different experience--nice, clear transmission. Also, I am impressed with a company that cared so much about my individual experience that they did so much at their expense to give me a better experience. Well done!"
"For the price it was the exact quality I'd expect. Looks good, fits great. Excited to how long it will last!"
Battery was weak giving a spotty signal to my Vivosmart but once the battery was replaced it is spot-on now.
worked good for a week and then intermittent for a day and then no output.  I opened the sealed charger section and could see where the capacitors spewed oil on the inner case.  Ended up just cutting the end off and attaching it to a 12 volt car adapter.  It charges that way so it must not have been any fault of the Xoom tablet.  Get yours from motorola and save yourself the aggravation.
"Perfect, covered nicely my phone with glass protector on the top."
"Fast Charger! Works well with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and S6 cell phones, as well as my Samsung Galaxy tablet!"
This amp right here is a good amp i love this one it play real good on some 12s and on some 15s if you are look for a good amp this here will be the best one..
if you have a garmin for your motorcycle this is the cable you need to hard wire it to the bike.
"Nice cellphone. The display is easy for your eyes, since it has an automatic brightness control. The camera feature in great. work excellent for Movistar. Very satisfied."
"Though delivery took a while, the case fits the phone very well, providing good protection without the bulk of some cases."
"Very sexy looking, well fitting, and good looking case. Only thing it could possibly do better is be waterproof.<br />Survived a few falls already."
"These headphones can be fine as an entry into the foray of wireless headphones, though if you are looking for a value purchase that will last for a while this may not be the option you should choose, especially because this is purchased via an independent seller in Japan who will make it difficult for you to replace your likely broken headphones, as they have made it difficult for me.<br /><br />It's very easy to enjoy these headphones when you first receive them, as the packaging looks great and they work decently enough when you first begin to use them, after figuring them out depending on if you have past experience with bluetooth headphones or not. If you do have past experience, you probably won't like these as much.<br /><br />The sound quality is ok, though it leaves much to be desire compared to other competing headphones. I immediately noticed that the sound was inferior to previous headphones that I had purchased, though it's not as if these headphoens have terrible quality. The price is good as well, but once again compared to other competing brands you would be able to find a superior product in the same price window. The earbuds don't fit too great depending on ear sizes and I have noticeably small ears, especially for the size of my head, so these can seem a bit taxing to wear after and extended usage.<br /><br />The overall look is nice, but at the cost of having uncomfortable plastic material that always feels like it is going to snap. As a matter of fact, my headphones did snap on one side, and it's not as if I employed heavy usage to these things to try and test their limits anyways. On top of the snapping, all of a sudden my headphone stopped functioning via the included wire, which is a crucial feature to have, as naturally the sound quality is better with a wire and I don't always have battery because of the somewhat poor battery life for these headphones. Because of the product trying to look &#34;cool&#34; like other popular competitors like Beats Headphones (which are an even more horrible investment) they sacrifice more sturdy and logical alternatives to make these headphones long lasting and high quality headphones.<br /><br />Even after all these problems, I hoped maybe a warranty would be able to fix something or try to at least get some help. Until I purchased these, I wasn't aware that I got them through Japan, though that is obviously my fault. Even after realizing that information, I wasn't aware how difficult it would be to try and set up any type of help with repair or warranty. I would contact audio-technica trying to get information, and they would tell me to contact the individual seller I (and you would/will have) purchased them from, and that they couldn't help me in this situation. Then I would contact the individual seller and after responding way later to my questions about warranty, they would try to tell me to contact audio-technica, ultimately proving to not be of any help. The confusing back and forth really rubs me a wrong way as a consumer and leads me to believe that I have been set-up a little bit in terms of warranty, but that is what it is, just wanted to warn anyone who was planning on purchasing these and thought they would be secure if problems occurred.<br /><br />All in all these wouldn't be the worst purchase to make, there are just better alternatives currently available on the market that will be less of a headache to deal with on the customer support side of things so I'd say stay away."
When it states wireless i was expecting something you charge and use to  charge your phone. Still needs a wire
"Over all exactly what I expected, I knew I would be purchasing a knock off life proof and that's exactly what it is. Overall functions just like a normal life proof. Only bad thing is you have to take the case off every time you need to charge your phone."
"Works great, I use it for my Microsoft Surface 3  2 phones and a Samsung 12.2 pro tablet  . Non of the plugs even get slightly warm. thank you Anker for making a great product that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
"Yes. It met my expectations.  I love it, and I like your services.  Your company is good for whatever services you offer to the general public."
"Unfortunately, although this cable worked perfectly, it comes in my a-hole cat's favorite chewing color so it only lasted for a couple of days. If Samsung could make a white one that would shock my cat into the kitty underworld, I'd give this 5 stars. :)"
"Multiple people, multiple products, everyone happy.  iFlash 4-port USB car charger is a life saver.<br /> No more fighting over who gets to charge their phones or ipads.  I have regular cords and two 6 foot cords so that people in the back can charge at the same time.  This is a must!!<br />I have not noticed any charging concerns. Everyones phones and ipads charged at regular rates.<br />https://www.amazon.com/review/RSK4FZJ5TIIEQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"
"Cute case. Can hold ID and a couple cards, but not cash and cards and ID because then it won't close. But overall, exactly what I wanted. Perfect for nights out on the town. Love the wristlet attached to keep hold of it!"
"Works great!  Very clear reception, and good enough distance (picks up about 15-20 feet away)"
"As much as I would like to give it 5 stars, it deserves a 4 (just because I'm nice), but maybe even a 3. The reason is that is uncomfortable to wear, as the phones weight brings the cardboard down on your nose, making it an annoyance and actually hurts my nose. So to fix it, I just a napkin to somewhat cushion it, though I am now looking into other products of better quality. This was a good introduction, and I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Though for the price range, I would look at other products that offer nose support, and I honestly believe they are overpriced and should at the most be $5, or less!"
Love the waterproof design and the capacity of this case bag. It can be used during beach day or for travel. Nice case.
can't believe the deal I got. I received a discount on my order for a fair review. this is great!
Great value.  Cover goes on easy and stays on.  Can't beat the price compared to more expensive versions
Great Product!!!!
"&#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&#34;  That being said, I believe the price of $8.95 would be a good deal as well. The case comes safely packaged in a molded plastic container that is actually easy to open. It contains a neck strap and a belt clip so that you can wear it on your person either way. I believe both are sturdy enough for moderate physical activity. The case itself is a squishy plastic pouch that closes at the top with two plastic locks. It seems to lock tight and keeps the water out; although I don't know that I would want to keep it submerged for long periods of time. It is designed to float and I think that would be safe unless it is damaged. I plan on using mine mostly to guard against rain when I am out in bad weather or in the shower if I am expecting an important call, etc. The case I ordered fits my HTC One perfectly and allows me to operate the phone while it is in the pouch. It has a clear back window as well in case I needed to take a picture. Operating the phone a lot in the pouch may result in the phone heating up, so use it wisely. It also came with a small micro fiber cloth to clean your phone. The only slightly negative point is that the case is not yellow; it is more of a very light green. That is no big del for me as I mainly wanted it to be brightly colored to locate it in the dark, etc."
"Was a gift for my dad for Christmas, and he loves it!"
"VERY tight fit - I can barely slide the phone in. Also, the holes at the ends of the window opening don't line up with both the phone jack and the power button.  You have to slide the phone in upside down to be able to line up the phone jack. The circle &#34;home&#34; or &#34;wake-up&#34; button is pretty much covered up, so It's hard to hit that as well once the phone is in the case.  It was cheap, and I got my money's worth - NOT WORTH IT!!!"
"I bought one of these for my iPhone 5 and then when I upgraded to my 6+, I got this one.  I love this thing.  I use it mainly for my RFID access card at work.  I gave the iPhone 5 one to a fellow worker and he's completely given up carrying a wallet now.  He loves it too."
"This item holds the phone for a selfie, but does not come with any means to take the picture from afar... uggh"
I am still using this product!  My only complaint is that after months and months of use and being bitten on by my son; the rubber has started to bend easier and lift away from the hard shell.  It still works great!  The softer portion just becomes easier to pull on after a while.
My favorite case!  This case has endured hundreds of drops on concrete and tile with no damage.  My only issue is that the blue started to look dirty after awhile and I couldn't get the stains out.  I bought this same in case in grey so finger prints were not as noticeable.
It was a really comfortable fit but I couldn't hear anything that was coming over the walkie which is kind of the point.
not happy at all with OEM I had to get one of my batterys replaced because one of them never worked when I received it then they sent me 2 more battery's and again one of them did not work I will not buy another battery from OEM again
This is the best phone holder I have seen in a long time!! Fits in cup holder and stays in place. Easy to use and holds phone tight!!
"Awesome looking case, makes the phone standout more than your average, cheaper cases. The one star off is for the case being a tad loose, it allows debris to enter the case and traps it there."
"It's inconvenient to carry, so I only use it on days when I know it's going to rain. I am personally fine with the fact that you can't really hear anything when the phone is on the case because that means its pretty much waterproof. It's perfect for concerts and festivals because then I don't have to worry about ruining my phone."
"Great hardware, but android 5.0.2 is horrible. I wanted to love this phone because of the value it provides, but it's just a miserable experience with 5.0.2 and motorola is not clearly communicating when the phone will receive 5.1.x. It can take 20 seconds to switch from app to app or open apps due to 5.0.2's memory management bugs.<br /><br />I bought a used nexus 5 and I'm MUCH happier.<br /><br />Nexus IS android. Everyone else is just a middleman vendor that will end up frustrating you with non-support for your phone (be it security patches or just OS upgrades).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get a used nexus 5."
"I used to buy and use oem micro usb's often and I would usually get either the 3ft or 6ft because as much as I like the short ones, sometimes you need it to be longer for my portable battery chargers. When my portable chargers are not in use, I usually wrap my cables around it so I don't have tangled mess...for some reason these &quot;oem&quot; cables end up going back. I'm just glad to have that piece of mind of it not breaking, especially when I need it in an emergency. Not only do these look great, they are strong and durable as well! you can tell by just looking at them."
"The screen protector that I had on my tablet before was great and did its job well.  I dropped my tablet and the screen protector saved my devices screen from damage.  I was looking for the same screen protector that I had purchased before, but they are no longer available on Amazon.   I decided to give this product a chance and so far I am happy.  The screen protector arrived quickly and in great condition.  I opened it up and it includes an alcohol wipe, a dry wipe, and a sticker for removing small particles from your screen before applying the screen protector.  The quality is just as good as the more expensive one I had previously if not better.  It looks great, the cut outs are where they need to be, and the Samsung stylus works as it is supposed to.  I am happy with this purchase and I am confident that it will protect my screen in the event that I drop my tablet again."
"Looks really nice.  Matches an aluminum Apple watch sport 42mm pretty well.  Comfortable to wear all day long, and seems pretty secure.  Very impressed."
Holds phone firmly in place.
Worked perfectly for our Kindle as well as our Verizon ellipsis tablets. Best price I could find.
Used these to replace some junk ones on some chargers I bought.  Tight reliable connection.  Highly recommend.
"I have always bought Spigen cases and so far the case has been great! It is thinner than the Tough Armor case.  It seems that it will protect my phone if it's dropped.  I see some of the issues that other people could have about the plastic breaking.  I don't take my case on and off often, so I hope I don't have the breakage problem.  Not bad for the price. The only complaint is that the color I chose was a bit darker than I expected."
"Loved the case and holster. The only drawback was the screen protector, did not lay flat against the phone so I removed it. Now it is perfect!"
"This is probably the best phone mount I've ever owned. Solid, sturdy, and fits a Nexus 6. Would definitely buy this again."
I really like this. It reminds me of the Outer Box but at a lower cost. The only thing I wish they had would be the plastic guard for screen.
Best buy for its money ! Came with screen protection film. Love it !
"Best screen protectors ever. I accidentally put it on upside-down the first time, but once I tried the second time it wrnt perfectly. No bubbles, and is very smooth but not a weird matte like feel to it. I have only used one for several months and it doesn't look like it's coming off any soon. Would definitely buy again if I needed to!"
Real nice n sturdy. My wife really liked it. I did too. Should do the job n keep that $500 phone safe.
"I have very small arms and was pleased when I put this on and it fit comfortably. I was able to put my phone in the pocket with the case on which was also nice, as they can be difficult to get on and off. I have not gone on an extended run yet but so far am pleased with my purchase."
"Bought my second one last week for my wife's car. So far, these cables seem to hold up much better than the other cables we've purchased online and in stores."
I like the easier access when I'm charging my phone. BAD THING IS ONE OF THE 2 I ORDERED WORKS. Wish both did.
I've used this a few times already since purchasing it. It keeps the phone dry and I don't even notice it's on my arm while running. Thanks!
This product does not function properly  https://youtu.be/AoBPZm8xcys
Doesn't have an opening for the off and on and the volume other than that it would have been fine you literally have to take the device out of the case just to turn it on and off.
"GOOD: Really good quality rubber on the inside lining and good non-slip hard outer cover. Last case I had my phone slipped in every surface, luckily this one is sticky enough but not too bad for pockets and very slim. Although, if wearing slim or skinny pants, you will prefer taking the phone without a case, with normal pants I can't feel it there.<br /><br />BAD: The only drawbacks are the lettering on the side &#34;Lightning Knight&#34; sounds like a 8-year-old wrote it, and the top and bottom sides where the ports are do not  have the hard shell protection, only the flexible rubber protects it from a straight-down fall. The hard shell does cover the sides and all the back of the phone."
"This thing is hard to put together. I mean, granted, I didn't read the directions, but how hard could it be? unscrew some stuff, clip it on, put the base holding the phone on. 1. it doesn't lock the base on. 2. it moves constantly. 3. once you remove the ball that allows you to adjust the angle, you can't get it back on. Not as great as people made it out to be, but it's a decent purchase and if I had to do it again, I would have liked to know that the thing actually holding your phone doesn't actually lock onto the rest of the apparatus.  Update: 9-21 about a year after purchase It broke clean off where the suction cup is glued to the plastic. How unfortunate. It wasn't a great product to begin with and now because it is not sturdy or long lasting, I've downgraded from 3 stars to 1 star."
"I have been privelaged enough to actually sample quite a few products from Joto and all of their products are great quality and nicely priced. I did receive this G4 phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. This case is for the LG G4, the case itself is clear so you can actually show off your brand new phone. A lot of people don't like that most cases actually hide your phone and people do care or they wouldn't make phone color options like white, black, silver etc...So this allows you to display your phone while adding that much needed protection that all phones need. Snaps on nice and easy, no modifications whatsoever are needed. All functions of the phone are uninterrupted, so all in all this is a 5 star case in my opinion.<br /><br />I did receive this phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review!"
"detector works very well, and looks like a premium model."
Not a bad case. Feels good in my hand. Doesn't slip out of my grip. Looks nice and thin but still provides decent protection. Fits the edge screen nice. Only issue is that when removing phone it's a little tough and the metal band around the case  will occasionally pop off but is easy to slide back on.
"These are great Headphones! I wish I would have invested in the earlier. I workout with these every day and I have had no problems with them. I usually cannot keep earbuds in my ears for the life of me, but these stay in regardless of what I am doing. I keep my phone in a backpack in the corner of the gym and can move about everywhere and not lose signal. I have also used these on a plane and they do an excellent job of blocking out any noise. Sometimes I don't even realize the flight attendant is talking to me. I would definitely recommend buying these."
"I love the case that replaces my wallet. I like the look as well. Unfortunately, just like so many other reviewers, the plastic that is suppose to hold the phone in the case has been cracking and falling off. I see some reviews where this happened as soon as one month and some about two, I guess I am not as hard on my case because I have had mine for about 5 months. I doubt it will last much longer, the last piece hold one side on is actually held with superglue currently. I might actually buy it again, ten bucks for something that works for 5 months isn't too bad in my opinion. Just be warned, if you are tough on cases, drop your phone, sit on it, or even plan to take it out of the case often, this will not be a long lasting option for you."
"Wow, now have a phone without contract and it works great."
best  selfie stick
"This provided me the charge to fill up my phone's battery many times over, and it will last a long time if you don't need to use it, so you don't need to worry if you forget to charge it"
just as described.  arrived like 2 weeks before the delivery date provided
My wife loved it!
"It's pretty. It's light.  But it only charges my phone one and half times before dying.  If you want capacity, don't buy this."
"Great price - the case seems very secure, and the iphone is easy to use with it - don't have problems with the volume control, etc., that other people have commented on.  My one complaint is that there were no instructions, and I had a hard time getting the case OPEN so that I could insert my phone - there were no instructions on the website, so I googled it, and finally found a you-tube video that explained it.  Otherwise I'm happy!"
"after the second use it stopped charging via the sun. And since I didn't use it immediately, it's ineligible for return.  Fairly useless as solar products go. Don't buy it."
"Best headphones. It has 3 buttons that let you switch between calls and music with one touch at ease, and controls the music as well. I don't need to touch my phone when I am running outdoor work. I got it as free though. I am having nice experience with it."
"Feeling stupid.  Reading the description and doesn't state these are sold in pairs.  It states &#34;speaker harness&#34;, which I took as one.  So, I definitely have extra now..  Great product overall!!"
Works great.  Very sticky surface.  Hopefully it won't leave a residue on my car dashboard but will need to leave it for a while in order to be sure.
"I have been using this product, for a month now and it works really well. I have had lots of charger cables in the past but this is the best hands down"
"Brought this for my husband and he loves it. I held it a few times, and the case makes the phone feel nice in the hand."
"This battery is amazing!  Even on the very first charge, I got over 36 hours usage out of this thing.<br /><br />After my first full discharge and recharge, I got 65 hours usage out of it with my normal habits that involve regular amounts of youtube, texting and other programs.<br /><br />The included case is of relatively high quality as well, comparable to the Otterbox case I had on it with my stock battery.<br /><br />Instructions are clear and this thing will turn your phone into a thick heavy brick (approx. 1 inch thick) but the sheer amount of power you get out of this is well worth it."
"When it comes to easy to use, durable, and amazing phone mounts the Spigen Stealth is AMAZING! I use it every weekend when I drive for Lyft, and I get compliments at how sleek and out of the way it is compared to other phone mounts (and I have dead center in the car). I am able to mount and unmount the phone with a single hand, so there is never a sketchy moment where I am not holding the wheel (I never manipulate the phone while driving... SWEAR!!!). The only downside I have experienced is that some apps just don't have landscape mode, but Google Maps does... so yeah, this is a small downside."
"We have owned this charger for five months. It works great with our Apple Products: iPad Mini, iPad Retina, iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. It charges our devices as quickly as the chargers that came with them. Never have had any issues with it.<br /><br />I do wish I had read other reviews about the insanely bright blue light that emits from this charger when it is plugged in. I wish that it did not have this, but it does remind us to unplug it when not in use."
"i received this product free for review and it works great. i love that i can still see my screen on teh front, but the back is still protected by this case! it was easy to put on and fits perfectly."
"The battery is a little weak, but all else is working properly and in good condition ."
just what I wanted. Nice fit.
Great deal on multi colored charms. They hold up well and don't break too easily. Lots of bold colors in the mix.
"Fit the Note 3 fine, but doesn't hold a charge any better than the 16 month old OEM battery. Should have paid a little more for a higher quality replacement."
Saved my iPhone 6 from a disaster. Great warranty service as well. The protector does not have the best coverage.<br /><br />EDIT: Looks like the newer version has a better screen coverage compared to the pre release versions Tech Armor released
Nifty little product!
I keep my Garmin in it at all times when not in use. Fits like a glove.
"Ports seem a bit tighter than the stock part, but they work just as well. Installation was fairly easy by watching videos on YouTube. Just be careful when removing the screen. I wasn't as careful as I should have been and it seems as though I may have damaged some of the ribbon cables - now my home button doesn't work and there are horizontal lines running through the screen. But now my phone charges so at least I can use it. By using jailbreak/Activator I have been able to get around the home button issue."
"pretty good product, as a Soldier that just used this in the field recently this came in very handy. Product was durable as it was banged around in the vehicle.  No issues with the seller and I look forward to dealing with the seller in the future for future field product.  I actually have Army buddies that are interested in purchasing one for themselves.  Guess whole squad will have one then the platoon.  That's how good the product is.  I guess you can say its Soldier tested and Soldier approved."
"Tech Armor<br />Easy to apply, clear, no bubbles, no hassle. Let the protection begin."
I strongly advise taping your cord so that it doesn't bend near the microUSB port too much. I bought 2 and the first one bent too much and broke after 2-3 months. I've taped my second one so it won't bend (see picture)
"Good stylus, arrived as expected.  Other tips provide a slightly quicker response, but this is pretty good."
"I love this elegant, no-fuss, portable sound amplifier for my iPhone! It's easy and durable. When I don't need it to amplify, I prop my phone horizontally across the top of the sound pod to use it as a phone stand."
"awesome backup battery charger. I've put this charger through the test. I live in the Desert  (92254) and out here it gets warm. this device keeps up with me, iv taken it on road trips, office use, recreation, camping, fishing (in Zip Lock bag of course) and every wear in between. my kids get it from me to charge their cell phones and tablets. this is the second Anker charger I own, first charger is the Anker Astro 5. oh and I charge them with my Anker 14W folding solar panel. and they go every wear I go. I put them in my little Bug out Bag. I recommend this to the average traveler on the go."
A bit disappointed that the screen protectors do not completely go to the edge of the screen. There's a gap between the screen protector and the edge of the screen and every case I have put on pushes the screen protector back up.
can still see the original phone color come through yet provides good protection. Nice tight fit and slim I have watched my kids drop their phones on concrete or asphalt multiple times with this cover doing its job.
Product does a great job at protecting my ipod. Great feel and fits good. The cover does come over the edges all around which is great. Would have 5 stars if it was a lil tighter fit.
"Received the free samples,we are so pleased with this waterproof phone pouch/case.It can work for iphone6 plus and fits perfect, we are out on a boat, that will go fast and bounce and things can fall off even if you are taking care. So we trusted this pouch to protect the phone if it was to have a fall over into the water. No one wants to think there phone will fall in water or get dirt all over it. So it is best to be prepared, It can also hold a credit card or some cash too, It has a strap that you could tie to something or hook on your wrist as well. It is easy to put the phone in and out is just slides in or out, and there is two locking tabs on the top that seals it.<br />I received a free or discounted product for a honest and unbiased review. All statements are true.I received this product for free on exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Works just as advertised.  Easy to use, fits both Galaxy 5 and iPhones.  Charges quickly and is a great gift for children or adults.  Plan to purchase several for Christmas Presents."
I love this case...especially the fact that it wraps all the way around to the edges. The graphics are clear and look quite good.
Hasn't broken on me and they offer a lifetime guarantee so far I'm happy with them
It works perfectly.  I love it.  delivery was quick and I am fully satisfied.
"I had the Jawbone Up 24 for about two years until it finally died.  I loved it.  I called Jawbone and asked for suggestions.  He recommended the Jawbone Up Move this time. I ordered the clip and the bracelet.  I've had it for about three weeks now.  I have not used the clip but I use the watchband which is quite cheesy.  Aside from the looks, I know I'm going to lose it!!!  It keeps falling off; luckily, I found it!!  If I lose this, I'm going to switch to another brand.  I really don't want to lose it!!!!"
This did not work with my iCarez privacy screen protector. This works on my iphone but I would not recommend. Spend an extra few bucks on an adonit brand stylus. I borrowed a friends that works great.
"Great Silicone Case for the tablet.  Does make it a little hot while on, but not too bad that it affects it in anyway."
"It is TINY and came all bent up in an envelope, so it's pretty much useless. You get what you pay for.... when will I learn that??"
I am happy with this charger. Charged it first in the house and plugged it into my phone that night.
Absolutely love this case
i like it but it kind go. off the screen some time hv to stick it bk<br />but its okay
I recently purchased the 2 gb RAM version of this phone. The HD display is beautiful and it takes great pictures but when I discovered 1.5 gb of the RAM were consumed by google play and the other bloatware it came pre-installed with I sealed it right back up and returned it.
"I have gone through plenty of cables during my tenure with iPhones. Most are flimsy and poorly built and do not last long. I purchased this cable after buying other Tech Armor products and seeing that they are quality built and designed to last and do what their designed to do, PROTECT! I have used this cable for about 2 days now and you can feel the quality in the cable braid and the ends. I feel this cable is going to be with me for some time but if it ever fails, Tech Armor has a lifetime warranty. I have already had to use the warranty with my glass protection which absorbed the blow from a remote control that was thrown towards me but landed right on my phone. It took the blow and saved my screen!! There warranty is truly hassle free! You can't go wrong with Tech Armor!!<br />(Update) 9/7/15 After using this now for over a week I wanted to add that my charging time on my iPhone 6plus has decreased dramatically. It takes about 20 mins to go from 15% to 97% using my iPad mini charging block. I attribute this to the high quality materials used."
"Amazing, I put them in my 2002 Jetta and they were able to kick some decent bass. For about 30$ a pair, they were really impressive"
"Great receiver, especially for the price, only wish it had come with the mounting bracket and wiring harness from my vehicle.  The information wasn't quite clear on what was included and/or required for he installation.  Regardless, the receiver works great and easily pairs with my phone for IM, phone and musing control.  The Aux and USB interfaces work great, and the USB port charges my phone at the same time - great benefit!  The interface is fully customizable, to the point where it may be overwhelming to some.  I enjoyed the vast array of configs so that I could make the interface my own.  The receiver does a good job of pushing out a high quality audio experience which on it's own is quite loud enough for my enjoyment!"
"Pros:<br />-This is an interesting device. Great for school age kids, not allowed to carry cell phones in school or are playing out of immediate adult supervision.<br />- GPS live tracking software is very accurate.<br />- Calls like a regular cell phone.<br />- Downloading the app was super easy.<br />- Device usage simple for kids.<br />Cons:<br />- Product description DOES NOT speak to: impact durability, sweat or water resistance, or temperature extreme limitations (important when purchasing a product for active school age children).<br />- Battery comes connected. DONT accidentally disconnect the battery while removing the battery packaging. It is VERY difficult to reconnect.<br />- Use CAUTION when removing the battery packaging as it contains the IMEI & ID number. (NEEDED to activate the SIM card).<br />- Setting the time was a small chore. ALL EST zone folks, you will need to manually enter (-4) in the time zone application set-up. This info is not in the directions.<br />- Directions are incredibly vague. You will have to trial and error with the phone and software.<br />- CHARGER is NOT a micro USB 5V. I repeat, the charger is NOT a micro USB 5v!!!!!!!! It is a two prong connection and I am still trying to find out what it is called."
works perfect
The case did not come with the bow and the rhinestones come off very easily.
i really like this case it fits very well and it has a cute and cool design to this case its a very soft silicone thats very protective.
"RECIEVED THE COVER TODAY,I LIKE IT VERY MUCH"
Thanks.  Sk8Maui.com MauiStyleAloha.com
"Overall, this a great screen protector. Fits the iphone 6 as advertised, slightly smaller than the screen leaving a 1/8 inch of screen exposed around the edge. The protector I received had some slight defects with the beveled edge, but they are tolerable."
Exactly as described.  The camera hole sets this protector in a class by itself.
This broke instantly after fitting it to my phone. Terrible quality.
"The first unit I received had been used.  You could tell because there were smudges on the surface and what looked like bits of plastic on the sides.  I contacted Mogix because I was concerned that it had been a returned product and within a day they had shipped me a new one, no charge and even let me keep the first one!  Customer service could not have been nicer and continued to check that I had received my new unit and was satisfied.  After dealing with under-performing customer service reps before, this was a pleasant surprise.  AND I love my Mogix charger.  It works perfectly."
It works great except the cord didn't hold up. It serves as though it's pulling away from the source. Wires address now exposed. Other then that it works!
"Great instructions, easy to install with the alcohol cleaner, dust removal, etc. for two glass screen applications. Thought it's a great product at a great price. Best thing is that the glass doesn't negatively impact the touch sensitivity!"
I have always been and Otterbox user for many years. I tried this product when i found it on amazon. this product for me has been stronger than the otterbox. i have dropped this product on numerous occasions and even ran over it with a riding lawnmover. other than minor scratches it was in perfect working order.
"bad the pouch were you put cards has a pictire window which leaves mark on phone, plastic were you insert phone cracked after a week don't waste your money"
Charger doesn't work after 3 weeks.
I ordered this item for.my husband and he absolutely loved it...thank you very much.  Works great
"I really like the Silicone rubber texture feel<br /><br />- Keep in mind there are multiple sizes for whatever your need may be<br />- 10 inch size is great for some applications and frustrating for others to keep in mind what you will use this for! Works great for Portable Power Chargers and plugging into Computers or USB Hubs that are on your table or desk<br /><br />- Seems to be easier and is more flexible then some cable<br />- MFi Certified, no error messages, charged my iPhone 5S completely even tested flipping the cable back and forth, worked great<br />- Cable is a thicker, hopefully this is for added protection, but also the ends are thicker and may make it difficult or impossible to plug into slim or special cases"
"Great screen protection, very easy to apply. Just make sure you don't touch the sticky side with your fingers might leave a bit of a print. Touch sensitivity goes from 10/10 to 9/10 But nothing thats really bottersome. Screen smoothenes 10/10, and look 9.5/10. Great buy would definitely buy it again! !"
This product is awesome! I've been using FRiEQ with Polar Flow on my iPhone to record my swim workouts the past three weeks. My iPhone has been kept dry and I can check it between laps to check my heart rate and calories burned. Very satisfied!
if you like 17 bubbles this piece of junk is the one you should buy
"Nice 200 watt marine head unit with FM, AM, WB aux in and a USB port. Dose NOT have a CD player and that is okay for me. The weather band is a very handy feature to have, I am surprised that more marine stereos don't come with it. I bought this to replace a Clarion M235 and it sounds way better. I have this radio hooked up to four  5.4&#34; Blaupunkt MSx542 marine speakers and they sound great together."
nice and match the space gray colour of my sport watch.......the only is the sharp edge of the bracelet that causes some itchiness and mark on my skin......
this phone cover was for my neighbor girl. she likes it. the color is nice. and fits good.
"I have purchased both these and the 6 inch version of the same cable.  I have had no bad cables and no problems with them.  the Magnet and holder help them fit nicely in a laptop bag.  I can grab the black, white, and grey cables and give the kids the colors.  I have them both in my laptop bag and in my car in the Texas heat all day and have had no failures.  I was a bit worried about the open design getting dirty and causing problems but have not experienced that yet.  Seems to be the perfect solution for the need for a bunch of cables around the house to charge various devices."
The only thing that I would have to say about this case is that the wrist band to hold the cell phone broke fairly easily I only had the case for two weeks in the wrist band broke
Works well.  Item exactly as expected.
"Nice quality, worked great,"
it did not look like wood at all like the photo it was a bad print as soon as i received it i had to put a sticker over it.
"This was purchased for my husband's phone. He's rough on his phone and I needed a case that will help protect it. He likes the look of this case and it is thinner than the case we had on his phone before. I think I am going to purchase this case for my son's phone as well. The kickstand on the back would be perfect for my son because he likes to watch videos on his phone and this kickstand holds the phone sideways and not straight up like his current case.<br /><br />The 4 stars may be a little premature, but I'm not sure how the phone will hold up when it is dropped on a hard surface like the sidewalk. The other case he had was both hard and rubber and I know that it protected the phones when dropped."
I've had mixed results with this FM transmitter.  It works perfectly with my iPod Nano 1st Gen.  But I can't use the dock (30 pin) connector with my 3rd Gen. iPod Touch without it pausing constantly.  The connector just isn't a good fit for that iPod model--or this particular iPod (though other 30 pin connectors are fine with it).  It DOES work with the iPod Touch if I only connect it via the audio cable.  But the volume is lower that way.<br /><br />The 'transmitter' part of the iClever works pretty well; the signal is often nice and clear.
I received the screen protector on time and in excellent condition. It was very easy to apply to my screen. Absolutely no problems or complaints from start to finish. Thank you for a great product.
"Awesome slim design.  Slips in and out of my pockets very easily.  I've dropped my phone a few times since I've had this on my phone, once on pavement, and it has protected my phone very nicely."
Love the bumpers and the color choices. The back is clear with the color along the sides of the phone. I hate bulky cases and a bumper is the perfect choice for me.
Good quality and nice finish. Though its little bit heave for its material but good to have such a product. Kids will love to play with it.
"I only bought this Samsung phone case to see if I would like it better over the Samsung Galaxy Ace Style S765C Stardust s766c Case Wydan (TM) Hybrid Studded Diamond Rhinestone Case but I did not, so I returned it. The color's on the case I loved but, did not keep it long enough to really try it out."
"This case has far exceed my expectations. Not only does the case give my phone a classy look, but it also protects my phone very well. The case it two-fold; the first comes is a soft rubber like material that covers the entire phone, then you finish it off by enclosing it with the bottom and top part that come together. Surprisingly durable and complete access to all ports."
"issues because of the curved screen, I hope they make a hard glass version with the edge curves soon"
"REALLY hard to put on and take off, I broke the front trying to take it off the first time and had to superglue it back together"
crystal clear.  much better than the flimsy peel off protectors.
"Light, thin yet a durable case. I bought the teal one but the color is not as bright as it in the picture :( but I still love the case. Thinking of getting it in different colors. :)"
Had the screenprotector for less than day and already cracked with barely hitting it.  I do not recommend this product whatsoever!!!
Too bulky and sticks out too far from the vent.  I like the cradle design.  I just don't like the bulkiness of it.
The first two I bought for my grandkids worked great. The last one I bought says Google Play is not compatible with this device and I can't load the games I bought for them on it.  The other two worked fine with Google Play and I have 40 or 50 games on them for various age levels. The last one I received did not come in the manufacturers Contixo box as the other two I purchased did so I'm not sure if it was a refurbished one or not. It was supposed to be new but came in a plain white box. I had planned on buying one more for my grandkids but now I'm hesitant to purchase anymore.
Definitely does NOT fit the ballistic nylon phone... Cannot even use the side buttons because they do not line up properly. Wish it actually fit my phone though. Depressing and false advertising. Will change rating when I hear why you lied and said it actually fits my phone. -Droid Turbo Ballistic Nylon
"exactly what i was looking for, not too bulky, good protection.  fits my needs at a great price!!"
"Good Product if you are just looking for depth and water temp, I was . It does work for fishing but I think a die-hard fisher would want one of the bigger models. Easy install."
It didn't work well with my OnePlus One.
This is the best phone case I have ever had.  I am a very clumsy person. I would say I drop my phone on average at least 4 times per week. I have dropped my phone where it has actually bounced off the side of a table and then hit the floor and my phone still worked. I have also dropped my phone in a puddle of water and my phone was fine. While I don't suggest trying this at home I would suggest this for any other clumsy person out there. For this price you can't go wrong and it's not bulky like some others out there.
"The pens are wonderful,i really like the colors and the s smooth way they write"
"Awsome case while it lasted, to bad it was only 2 weeks."
Just ok.  I bought a few & 1 broke so it doesn't hold the cell phone in place.  The other one takes rapid fire pictures when it feels like it off & on.
"This, like everything else I have tried from Anker, works exactly as advertised!"
It doesn't  protect you phone it cheap and unsafe could break easy don't by this piece of plastic
"This case is a piece of garbage.  My daughter received it for her birthday to &#34;protect&#34; her new iphone 6.  The second time she went in the pool with the phone and the case, the phone suffered water damage and was rendered useless.  Now we own a worthless $70 case for a $600 broken phone.  These cases are a complete sham."
"I love wooden cases and this is exactly what I look for. The only thing I would suggest improving is the fitting, maybe a small hook at the lower corners would improve."
"Works great on Miata, Acura RDX, and PT Cruiser, with various versions of iPhones.  I use it ever day and it's showing no sign of falling apart."
"Didn't use it that long because it is really bulky, and makes a lot of things difficult to use on your phone.. So I just took it off."
"Previous versions are better. Look like Jawbone are not interesting to continue developing headset and they prefer go with the activity tracker, very disappointment"
Great protector.  Fit as advertised.  Customer service checked in to make sure I was very satisfied.  I am.
Amazing phone & for the price that I got it for (69.99) I surely cannot complain. Love it....Thanks PCS Wireless...
"This case is okay. It did protect my phone from multiple drops. I think the edge is raised just enough so that when you drop your phone face down, it doesn't land on the glass.  It is a very low-profile, slip case, easy to slip in and out of your pocket or purse, and allows the beauty of your phone to shine through.  That being said, the case really isn't very durable or long lasting.  I've been using it for a little over 3 months now and the pink rubbery edge has separated from the clear plastic and really this case is about to fall apart.  However, at a low price point, the case suited my needs for a while and I don't mind that it's time to buy a new one.  You get what you pay for, right?"
there very fun but they do not fit the fitbit as well as the original band but with that said it has latch keepers so it will not catch and fall off like the original fit bit band
"Got it today, its going back tomorrow, its that bad. This is something you would find at the thrift dollar store only nobody would buy it for even a buck so it would be on clearence for .50 cents! It is that cheap feeling. The fabric is probably the cheapest stuff ever produced and the &#34;bean balls&#34; inside are so light that they dont hold the phone worth a crap. This has to be the worst product ive ever purchased on amazon. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY REVIEW HIGHER THAN 2 STARS, because nobody in their right mind would think this is a good product for more than $1 at the dollar store."
Great product! Charges quickly and for someone like me who is always in a hurry and always on the go Who doesn't have a lot of time to wait or waste.  And I lose a lot of chargers and cords.  Sometimes they grow legs and disappear.  I will Buy this product again in the near future.
Received product and it was exactly as described. The charger is well made and very easy to use. I am very pleased with my purchase. This is one of my 3 Ravpower products. I have never been disappointed with how well they work.
Had this armband for less than two months and the right seam split apart the whole way and my ipod fell out while I was cutting grass. Would like manufacturer feedback on replacement.
"Yup, I should have taken the other low star reviews seriously.<br />I have never put on 1-star before, but this is the worst product I've purchased through Amazon.<br />This headphone, after working for about two weeks, would not work on the LEFT ear bud.<br />I really like the fact that the battery lasts over two days of on-off usage - so I won't complain about the Amazon not having the option of &#34;0&#34; star.<br />$27.99 and my time to write this warning review just went down the drain."
"Black is always my first choice. After buy this headphones i was so excited to get a black headphones, as well as it was my first buy in amazon. Now i am using this super quality headphones which has many nice features. I like their sound system, specially for crystal clear sound,never cut out during listen to song. It fits to my ear comfortably. Battery life much better than other headphones. Happy to get this headphones."
"Although I ordered the wrong phone (this is GSM but I found out later that I really I needed CDMA 450 MHz)<br />but nevertheless, I love the phone. The volume is enhanced, so that if you are hard of hearing this perfect. I gave it away to a friend who lives in a rural town in Yucatan, Mexico, actually it is for his elderly mom, who finds in hard to operate a small handheld cell phone. This is a fixed wireless desk phone that works great with a SIM card from the Mexican cell phone company TELCEL."
"S pen works accurately, battery last for well over 24 hours and that is with listening get to Pandora and tunein radio for 10 hours. Graphics are crisp and clear. Camera works well. If I needed a phone, I would buy this again."
"I received the charger very fast, and am pleased with the contact the seller has made to ensure I'm happy with my order. They seem eager to please, but I doubt I'll have to contact them, because I'm happy with my charger.  I like that it is slightly illuminated, so I can easily find it in the dark.  Note:  I believe the port labelled &#34;iPad&#34; has more amps, which is necessary to charge an iPad, but you can also use it to speed charge your phone if you have a quality cable."
Securely holds my phone (Galaxy S6 Active w/ a case) and the suction cup is amazingly strong.  To the point where I have a hard time getting it off the window when I want to move it to a different car.  I was completely unable to remove it until I found the tab in the back and even then it was not easy.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that the tab to remove it is tucked away underneath an overhanging piece of plastic (see the product photo) so it's hard to get a good grip on it.
"The protector does do a good job at protecting the screen, but I'm not overly happy with it's ability to adhere to the screen well."
"I received a promo code to give a fair review of this product. The case is fairly strong, and it does protect my phone without adding bulkiness. Overall I am pleased with this protection case. I would recommend this item."
I have bought many screen protectors in the past. This is the best one I have ever installed on my phone.
"It took a little while to get here, but it's super cute! I love it. I hate carrying around big purses, so this is perfect since I don't carry around a lot of things. I definitely recommend"
"Realized after I bought this that it was for an android phone, stupid me. So I gave it to a friend and he told me the lighted cord only lasted for a week...maybe a fluke?"
I am pleased with the product and the view that it gives. I would have given it a five star rating if the information that came with the kit dealing with installation and operation was more complete. Although tech support was right on.
"This is a little bulkier than I would like but I like that it has a replaceable battery. I put this on my Son's iPod case since he keeps misplacing it and it has helped us not leave it in restaurants and find out if it is still in the car or his room. I have used the sound emitter from the app several times. The distance tracking is not that accurate, but the play sound ability makes up for that."
"I am a regular shopper of Amazon, and never leave reviews.  But this is worth a review since it has none prior to mine.  I ordered two other cases before this one, and they weren't to the level of this one.  The phone case fits very nice around the phone and has a soft leather feel to the back.  It has strong magnets that keeps it in place in the wallet, but still makes it easy to remove when you want to use just the phone for pics etc. without having the bulk of the wallet.  This was what I was looking for in a case the most...a wallet that still allowed for the phone to be easily removed if needed.  The card holder having 9 slots and snaping together so that your personal info isn't viewable when you are using or checking your phone is wonderful and surprisingly hard to find in other cases.  Having the card slot designed this way also prevents the cards from scratching your screen.  The only thing I would change about the case would be to make the strap that holds the entire case together a snap instead of a magnet.  I haven't had any issues with the magnet, but it would feel more secure if it was a snap.  I would recommend this case to anyone that has the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus."
"Terrible quality pieces of garbage is what these are. Stay away from this screen. Ordered one, did install, screen faintly lights up black, no color, no picture, no usability. Tested the flex cables coming from the screen, they connect fine, and appear to be in overall good shape, more than likely the pins on the lcd cable do not line up properly with the pins on the actual phone...per usual hong kong handmade style. At this time though, unknown cause of  the issue. Took off and ordered a replacement from the seller. Second one arrives after several days of waiting. It should have been sent with the original two day shipping, but instead they sent it at their own pace. Did the install, and voila! Same exact issue. not a difference at all. Clearly these screens are pure garbage, they are not tested, and they do not work. The price of this product might make people think it is of quality, but it is truly a rip off......Buyer beware...."
"Does not work well if your CD slot has a curved face. Many factory CD players have a curved face and this mount does not stay securely in place because the nGroove blade has a straight edge, so the outer parts of the blade don't fully insert into the drive. Other reviewers indicated this still works on a curved slot, but it fails miserably in my car. Stays in place for about 20 minutes and then wobbles and pops out. Sending this one back for refund unfortunately."
The edges peel up. Tried to reapply multiple times. The fit is really bad. Buy a name brand and save the frustration.
"the the diamond look (bling) part that traces around the case,came off on day 2. the 2 pieces of stone that is on the closure came off as well. it was not worth the money. if I should you all a picture of this case and I haven't had it a month you wouldn't believe how quickly it fell apart..very disappointed"
"Case is ok. Good build, but the silver looks a LOT brighter on the Amazon photos. In reality, the color is very dull/boring/gray-ish. I was expecting more of a bright silver finish."
"Can't beat the price, but this product broke within three days of purchase. But I don't feel bad since the price was cheap."
"I loved this particular case for the way it fit and the fact it actually feel like a case, not a piece of rubber I found in previously owned ones."
Great case. Very protective but not too bulky. IR blaster works great with this case too. I've dropped my phone a few times (on concrete too) and not a scratch to my phone.
Good phone protection. easy to clip on a belt. maybe a little too much velcro but that's an easy duct tape fix. just cover some of the area with a small patch.
Received in a timely manner in condition described. Happy with the quality of the product. Haven't stopped using it yet! Love this thing.
I love the idea of the case but mine and my husbands broke within a week the plastic by the power button cracked and now the door wont stay closed
"Perfect fit for my Bose unit, the handle makes it easier to carry without dropping it."
Arrived with corner of glass cracked. Wet wipes included in kit did not do the job in getting phone clean. Worst screen protector I've purchased thus far.
very good protection. fit very tight. makes swiping from the sides a bit difficult and the power button becomes incredibly sensitive.
I guess its my fault for breaking it but the connection could have been more reliable leading up to that
"My 10 yr old loves this cell phone cover.  It is stylish, and I am pleased at how well it protects her phone."
"Delivery was early, so that was great! Protector goes on very easy, no bubbles whatsoever. Protect doesn't go all the way to the sides, but that's to be expected. I dealt with the same thing with every protector for my iPhone 6 plus. So that wasn't a deal breaker for me. Cut outs our dead on, so no problems there. But smudges!!!!!!! Smudges are ridiculous! Even with clean clean fingers the oil Smudges are pretty bad. For the privacy part. It does a very good job. If it wasn't for the smudge issue, I would have given this protector 5 stars. But I'm OCD and it bothers me."
Feels nice and slim. Really adds no bulk but the case started peeling off on the back. After about 2 weeks. Not happy. Especially since the color really complimented the original gold of the iPhone 6
Love it so far! Had an IPhone before. Like this better so far. The price I awesome!
This was cute but I returned it because it was not what I thought it was. The item was okay with no problems but I cannot say more than that because I did not use it.
This item worked great...once!  When I used it again (after the return period had expired)...it would no longer hold a charge...or is not fully recharging even though the lights indicate it is has completed charging.  Garbage!!!
After about a week of having it my wife showed be that it started to rip where it bends. The case looked nice till this happened. I guess you get what you pay for.
Rapid charger! Charges very quickly which is what I need!
"1 inlet port and 2 outlet ports keep this 11200mAh Portable Charger External Battery Power Bank simple and easy to use. Included in the package is a USB charging cord. This device has 2 ports to charge your phone, tablet, or other devices. 1 Port is rated at 1 amp and the second port is rated at 2 amps of charging capacity. This Charge Pack has a lot of muscle when you need it most. Fully charged this power bank should charge a iPhone 6 four to five times. Priced right and simple to use, get one today and stay connected.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this item was purchased at a discounted price for reviewing purposes."
Great case! It is sturdy. It has a nice design. I've dropped my phone several times and the case only has a few minor scratches but at least none are on the phone. I will definitely be buying cases from this company from now on.
"I've had this case for more than 6 months, no scratches so far even after multiple drops."
"I receive so many compliments and wonder that I am going to purchase another in another color.  It does make the phone slightly heavier, but well worth it."
The part where IDs was okay but there was no room for money how to put a small change purse in there very tight not what I expected.
"I bought this so I could simultaneously charge my Android phone, my wife's Iphone, and supply power to a car Dash cam.<br /><br />Because of the power draw of the three devices, as well as the length of wire needed to reach the dash cam, I really wanted to be certain that any three or four port charger was going to deliver high amperage and consistent to spec voltage to every device.  This works perfectly for my three devices, and I'm confident that I could even charge a fourth demanding device on the spare usb port!<br /><br />The build quality is reasonable for the price.  The device doesn't have an internal fuse, which may or may not give you pause; I would have liked to have a fuse on it preferably of a lower amperage than the fuse in my car's fuse box, but many prefer chargers without.  The reasoning I've heard for not having a fuse is that there is one less piece to break or lose if you continuously plug and unplug the charger.  That isn't my use case, but I respect that judgement.  Since it is a toss up as to whether this detracts from the device quality, depending on the tastes of the user, I can't deduct stars for it.<br /><br />It fits snug in the two 12v power points within front armrest and rear passenger cabin in a 2014 Chevy Volt, and is very awkward to use in the top of dash cubby 12v power point.<br /><br />Since I live in central Texas (aka 102 F summer weather,) I want to especially note that this device doesn't run noticeably hot, even when burdened with full charging loads from 3 2 Amp devices.  Every additional input of heat into the cabin of my car can make a difference, so I'm glad when something doesn't burn with the fury of a tiny 12v powered sun."
"very nice, love the colors, just wishing there were more choices for those of us, who own droids; not everyone has an I-phone!"
"Pure crap.  ive spent literally hundreds on zagg screen protectors over the past several years.  And I've largely been satisfied. But when it comes to the glass for iPhone 6 I'm on my third protector in less than a year.  The edges seem to chip almost immediately upon install.  I even had the last two &#34;professionally&#34; installed but it made no difference .  Yes, zagg warrants their products but frankly dealing with warranty claims is a hassle.  At this point I've got a hundred bucks in protectors for this one phone alone.  All in a span of about seven months.  I will probably file a warranty claim this time and when the fourth one fails (and it will) I'll try another brand.  I'm not going back to a poly protector after experiencing glass.  But I'm not going to keep putting these crappy zagg ones on either..."
"At 10 feet, I can plug my tablet or phone in at the charging station in front of my tv and sit on the couch and play clash of clans. It charged up my Samsung tablet albeit slowly, it still kept the tablet charged up while in use. This was by no means a lightning fast charge, but I was in no rush either. A cable this long requires a clip or twist tie to keep it neat and organized when not in use. Because of its rope like material, it does not kink easily like the traditional silicone/plastic style cables. But it can if pressed, squeezed, or pinched. If you have a family van, this works great if you don’t have access to a charging port in the middle of back of the vehicle. Now we don’t have to sit right next to the outlet to charge our gadgets.<br /><br />These come in bright colors so there’s no mistaking or stealing of cords in the same house.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for my honest review.<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/13/15<br />I recently noticed that for some electronics it did not charge at all. I had a small battery pack plugged in overnight to charge and when I remembered to grab my battery, it was not charged at all. But for all other items I use it for, it works well."
I love this case.  I followed the instructions and tested the case prior to using.  It's great for stand-up paddle boarding and I appreciate all the color options!
"It works, but It doesn't fit with a case. I used it for 2 days maybe."
I am very pleased with this case although it got dirty fast it's a cute case I would totally recommend this case it fits my iPhone 6 perfectly 👌🏼👌🏼 AMAZING CASE!!
It was just what I wanted they fit perfectly the quality also was great
"Great case especially for this price. Soft case with a hard case feel. Case extends around bezek to protect the front, keeps the phone nice and slim, clear so you can still show off the sthle of the phone. No complaints from me"
"the cables look like USB 3.0, but they aren't. I connected my cell phone to my Computer and didn't get the Use USB 3 message."
Love the design and the case but it's not flexible at all so it broke when I took it off once
"Good coverage, great color, not too thin or thick, fits in & out of belt pouch with ease! Color is true to pic!"
"Case fits well. Does not add too much in the way of size but still provides adequate protection. Case easy to handle, no slip."
Neither  cord worked
I love this charger. I went from 1% to 3% in less than 30 seconds. I would definitely recommend.
Works great and looks good too. Uses your existing Apple Watch charging cable and allows a convenient stand to prop your IPhone or other device to charge overnight while your watch is charging.
This is a great solar panel. It is thin and very light which makes it easy to put in a backpack without making it heavy and bulky. I was impressed that it could charge my smartphone and a 2000mah battery that I have. I will be getting another panel for some other solar projects that I have in mind.
"This is by far the best screen protector I've ever had.  It feels, looks and acts like a normal screen.  It was a breeze to install, took just a couple of minutes.  Also, it fit my LG G3 VIGOR perfectly.  The people who reviewed this saying it doesn't fit didn't order for the right phone, there is a difference in the LG G3 and the LG G3 VIGOR.  This is for the vigor, it is a different phone and size.  Edit: I had to come back and add to the review.  A few months after owning this, I had the &#34;ultimate test&#34;.  I dropped my phone, screeched when I saw a crack.  Took off the screen protector and my actual screen was fine.  It did just what it needed to do, the protector cracked, not my phone.,  I immediately ordered a second one, which was just easy to install as the first"
"Awesome phone!!! I gave a shot to this phone based on reviews seen online and I love it! Fast phone, screen looks sharp and the phone looks great. The shipping was extremely fast. It arrived before the expected date. I recommend it..."
"this case is ultra thing. i love it. the back has a texture that makes it not slippery but it is not sticky at all. had it two weeks, love it."
"I love this case. It fits perfectly and holds the phone in securely. The only thing missing is a belt clip/protective front cover which if included would make this the perfect rugged case for the Moto G. I don't use my &#34;phone&#34; as a phone. I purchased it for the sole purpose of using it as a backup camera and a link for a Sony action camera so I can use it as a viewfinder. I needed a rugged case that would take some abuse while out in the boonies and this thing delivers. It has a secure grip when my hands are wet and dirty and has taken a few good drops without issue. I do wish it had a front protective covering so when it's in a back pack or bouncing around in the jeep the screen itself would be protected. I did purchase another brand case which came with the belt clip/front cover. Come to find out this MoKo case holds the phone in much more securely and is built a bit tougher so I am just using the front cover from that other case on this one. MoKo, if you read this, please make a front cover/belt clip to go along with this case and I'll buy it. I don't even mind spending more for it since that would make this the perfect combination for the Moto G."
"For the price this is a fantastic cord. For the price it's great, and it's nice that it's a little longer than the standard Apple cord. It feels like it's made with decent quality pieces and parts, and all the connections fit snug, but not too tight.<br /><br />But I'm knocking it down a single star because it has the same issues the Apple cords have, and the end of the wires near the lightning adapter begin to fray after a few months."
"Elegant, high quality, real leather. In summary: What you expect from a BlackBerry case. Really recommended.<br />Now on the other side (nothing to do with the product, but important to mention), I think this case is on the expensive side considering the value of the Cell phone itself. But worth it any penny."
Great case. It's slim and doesn't add bulk like other cases I've tried. The only bad thing is the clear silicone edge has discolored to a orange color and can't be cleaned (I've had it 9 months now) . I've experienced this same phenomenon with another clear case form a different brand. I'm just assuming that clear silicone isn't the best if you want a truly clear case. I just ordered the same case from i blason except with the black silicone egde so I can still showcase my white phone but now have to worry about the egdes discoloring.
"This is a very sleek looking band!  I was a little surprised that it required &#34;some&#34; assembly, as others I've ordered, didn't.  However, that is NOT a deal breaker in any way!  This band looks great!  I love the black color.  Show's up very nice against the contract of the watch rim.  Also looks good to match the watch face.  Simple to install and includes a tool to remove unwanted links.  All in all, a great replacement band at a REALLY great price!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased/honest review."
"Delivery of case was sooner than promised! Case is very sturdy and tough, versatile too."
"Loved it!! Was as pictured n described! Arrived on a Sunday, was a huge surprise that it arrived so soon!!! It is perfect!!!"
"So far so good, had it on now for a few weeks and no issues. Keep my phone in my pocket and it isn't collecting dust or anything.  It is rather tight fitting, so getting it onto the phone was a bit tricky.  It actually sent my phone into recovery mode cause it was pressing buttons down while I stretched it on."
"Sturdy, durable case. Love how thick the screen protector was. I've dropped my phone 200 times and the case and screen protector has withheld it!!"
"I was curious how much Base they would produce I was greatly surprised for a 4 inch. Great sound overall, large magnet does it. For the price great drivers."
Didn't even stay on a week.  Kept popping off and was lost.  Don't waste your money.
"As described, works well with my Samsung S4 phone, fast charge."
"Bought this for my son's birthday because he wanted a great case for his iPhone and this is the one he chose.  It shipped promptly and came as described.  Within two weeks my son dropped his iPhone in a shallow bowl of water and it was submerged for about 5 seconds.  Water had gotten under the case, even though the case &#34;appeared&#34; to be tightly clamped.  iPhone was immediately removed from the case and placed in a bag of rice for the next 5 days.  No dice, iPhone is ruined.  False claim on the water resistant description.  If you want a case that looks nice, then go for it.  If you want a case that actually does what it says, then pass on this one."
make my life so much easier with a crazy cat that chews cable....recommend to anyone who has a monster pet
I love how this case looks! It is super lightweight does not add any bulk or weight to my phone.  That being said I do not think it offers very much protection either.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
Excellent device. Bit my phone like a dream and makes my phone look very cool. Thank you very much.  I would recommend this item to anyone that asked.
"I would recommend this product to my family and friends. It have been used almost 4 weeks with no problems and it charged very fast. I am very happy with the product, very good price and quality. I will buy it again from the company."
Best car charger I've ever had chargers so quick everyone that has quick charge on their phone should have this charger. Especially if your phone supports quick charge 2.0.
"These headphones have been life-changing for me! They are so comfortable to wear because you don't have to stick them in your ear.  They are perfect for any kind of activity, they stay put very well.  They are defintely sweat proof.  They charge quickly and the battery lasts for a lot longer than one would think.  They are easy to use and even have controls for volume, play/pause, next/previous tracks right on the ear! Whats more, they coil up and fit into any pocket or bag."
Now I have someplace to plug in all those USB devices without having to take up space on the power strip
"This product saved an Amazon Kindle Fire HD when Amazon themselves would not support the device or offer a replacement after one of their updates left the device in an unbootable state.<br /><br />My daughter has a tendency to fill her kindle with videos and junk.  This causes a known issue where if the File System gets too full it can actually corrupt, crash, and become unbootable, especially if an update is pushed and not enough space for a proper install remains.<br /><br />Amazon has not fixed this issue (HTC used to have a simialr issue on one of their phones but they did fix it).<br />So the Kindle was stuck on the screen that says it failed to boot and gave the 2 options of try again or reset to factory defaults.  Neither worked.<br />Amazon, when called acknowledged the issue but said since the Kindle was out of warranty even though the issue was known there was nothing they could do beyond offer a lousy 10% off on a new Kindle device.<br /><br />Hop over to XDA, look up issue, find solution, requires cable, and download of a fresh ROM image.<br />Use fastboot cable to boot device, use Amazon's own stock image file to restore device.<br />Reboot device, fixed and just like new.<br />Sign into account, restore apps, done.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing Amazon.  At least users at XDA and this cable helped."
If the price had of been any lower the seller would have paid me to take it. Great purchase
Plugs into the wall (with adapter) and then plugs in to the device. Charging/Syncing happens. Goal achieved.
It didn't work for my Zune device but the cable looked pretty new to me.
I've had this phone case for a while. I'm constantly dropping my phone and it still has never cracked the screen or anything with this case on.
"I love Caseology cases. This is my second case from them, and I couldn't be happier. My only concern happened on my first case: the brand name wore off after being taken out and put in my pocket so many times. Besides that, I love it! Would recommend to anyone looking for a plain case."
"This is far and away the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned for the purpose of working out. Let's start with the most important attribute for this niche: does it stay in your ears? I guess there are individual differences, results could vary, but in my ears at least it is as though the creature from Alien has attached itself but probably a little more comfortable (I don't know about wearing them for hours and hours but for a typical 60 minute workout they are more than comfortable enough). They stay in place even when running, even when getting very sweaty, perfectly fine in dynamic moves, functional fitness suspending upside down, whatever.... You do sometimes need to fiddle with them a bit to get them to sit properly at the start but once they are in, they are in.<br /><br />Next factor is audio quality: it is not audiophile level but IMO the best wireless sound I have experienced (though I have never sought out Bluetooth headsets primarily for sound quality) and more than enough for the kind of environments it would typically be used in: Bass is a little heavy but not overpowering, sound is clear and there are many wired headsets that would fall short.<br /><br />Noise isolation: simply put: very good. Possibly too good: you won't hear them coming. I personally prefer more ambient noise to be allowed in to make them better for running. Also you do get that &#34;internal sound amplification&#34; when you are running because they do make a seal with your ears. Therefore, they are definately better for workouts over jogs, but functional for either.<br /><br />Bonuses: spoken feedback &#34;Power on&#34;; &#34;Connection Successful&#34;; &#34;Battery low&#34;. Battery power indication on the iPhone (never seen that before, maybe I am getting old but seemed very nifty to me). That power indication is a little optimistic though, unlike the voice-nag that will start telling you &#34;Power low&#34; every few seconds about 10 minutes before the battery runs out (it is not the worst in this department though).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this headset is the button placement and function: firstly both sides have the same grooves, so that by feel you can't easily tell which side has the buttons on it (should I be able to remember that the buttons are on the left? Sure, there's that getting old again. But if, like me, you can't remember what side of the car your gas tank is on after 8 years, you will struggle with this). Secondly, it is hard to locate the gap between buttons such as volume/next-prev track and stop/start. As a consequence, I find it fiddly to control volume and tracks from the unit itself and I tend to just go to the phone to do it. Depending on how easy that is for you, the button position could get annoying. I can live with it, but it is not &#34;the best&#34; in this category.<br /><br />Waterproofing: tested once by putting it (accidentally) in the washing machine. Alas, my unit did not survive this, but personally that was not within expectations. So that is the limit. In terms of rain/sweat seems fine. But I wouldn't use it while paddling or anything.<br /><br />Battery life: is excellent and is as good or better than advertised.<br /><br />Finally, it is a possibly a poor hands-free (so says the only person I ever called on it). But I didn't care enough about this feature to really test it extensively (I like hearing that I have a call coming but happy to switch to the phone at that point and not use the headset while driving). Read other reviews if you intend to use it extensively for making phone calls as this possibly a serious shortcoming (if you need this).<br /><br />Well done Photive for a great and very well priced headset.s not the worst in this department though).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this headset is the button placement and function: firstly both sides have the same grooves, so that by feel you can't easily tell which side has the buttons on it (should I be able to remember that the buttons are on the left?

"PROS: Minimal and easy snap on protective case. Love the clear. iPhones are too good looking to cover up with a bulky, opaque case. The plastic is good quality and has some flexibility, so case buttons are easy and will not stick. I rely on this case and a protective tempered glass screen protector to breathe easy when I drop it. And I do drop it - and my phone stays safe and brand new looking! (I used this same case style and my last phone looked mint for years). CONS: Only 1. The case will slowly start to yellow over months, most noticeably around the 8th or 9th month in use. I like to replace the case every 5 months."
Easy to install. But about a week later my wife dropped the phone and the screen cracked. I did warn her that it was not gorilla glass. Wont bother replacing it again.
"Looking at this device as insurance, I see its appeal, having lost keys a few days ago for the first time in years and losing many hours in hopes of finding them, only for my daughter to find them by accident. This device lasts only about a year and cannot be recharged; the company offers a recycling opportunity that includes buying new devices at discount. I found the fob itself a bit bulky and doubt how useful it would be to attach to everyday devices such as remote controls. However, the idea of throwing one into one's luggage and/or backpack appeals to me, and it would certainly be a smart investment for one who tends to misplace particular items a lot. It works as advertised, as well. Just don't look at it as a one-time purchase. It isn't."
It was great.  Good quality and easy to slip on phone.
"I own a 2005 Equinox and it was one year shy of getting an aux-in. And 1 year too new to get a cassette player. So I have been stuck using FM transmitters. I have gone through several in the last ten years and they never worked very well. My car was great at picking up radio stations from mexico but it could never get a good signal from the fm transmitter. A few months ago I bought this and it has blown away all the other fm transmitters I have owned. The sound quality is great, I can hardly tell the difference between it and an aux in.<br />The good:<br />Sound quality is fantastic. Very clear strong signal far better than any other’s I have tried.<br />Bluetooth connects right to the phone once I get in the car and start it up.<br />Dial on the top makes tuning stations easy<br />No need for batteries, has a usb slot for powering device.<br /><br />The anti-good:<br />My car has the accessory-power jacks between the seats so that puts my fm transmitter in a bit of a hole. So for my car the neck isn’t long enough so a passenger is needed to manipulate it while driving. If you car has the jacks in a normal place, than you are fine.<br />No auto-scan. But that’s ok cause I haven't ever been impressed with those. The tuner on this works better.<br /><br />Update:<br />Recently it stopped working. Had a short or something. So I emailed the company and they sent me a new one no questions asked. Fantastic support!"
"I bought these for traveling on the bus to keep people from talking to me.  It worked.  I also have issues with ear buds staying in my ear.  These stayed on my head nicely.  The sound is quite good.  The buttons are solid.  I give it 4 stars because the power button takes some getting used to.  Otherwise, you can't beat a great pair of headphones for this price."
"So affordable, fits the screen perfectly, and came with instructions that made it SO easy to install perfectly. 10/10 would buy again."
For 20 dollars these are outstanding speakers! Well made! Quality looks better than my much more expensive speakers. BUY THESE! At this price its a steal!
So tiny yet so useful. I don't like carrying a wallet most of the time so this CardBuddy stretch allows me to carry just the essentials a credit card some cash and Id and bus card. 5 stars works great and gets the job done. Attaches to phone or case. I received a discounted sample in exchange for an unbiased review.
"So far, so good. I'm really enjoying all the features on my new phone. I looked at a bunch of reviews online before purchasing, and decided that this was the best phone for the money. I have had zero issues with it, and it does everything that I need it to. Camera even takes pretty good pictures! I'm impressed, but then, I already was a fan of ASUS."
No complaints -- tested all 3 and they work as expected. Will update if any quality issues crop up but so far so good.
"Incredibly thin and cheap feeling, the image is awesome but there is NO protection at all. Also let the package air out a few days, the fumes coming off these has got to be toxic."
These are solid. I love the cloth style. I forgot my first one in a hotel room so I got another one. That's how much I love this product. I use it all the time.
I received it in a timely manner and the fit is perfect. Nice product. Thank you
Great product for maximizing the lighter outlet in my car and allowing me to charge 2 things at once.  The iSmart power control is great.
Received it promptly a very solid case and looks great on my new S6 edge plus no issues at all
"The case works, but stays a little open. No big deal anyway. Doesn't seem to be a great protection, the back is too hard."
This case is incredible!  I've dropped my phone many times and the screen is perfect!  It is lightweight and not as bulky as other cases.  Easy to put on.  Just snap it on!
My wife loves the case!
Easy  to hold & charge the watch.
"Great case!  I've had mine for a few months now, and it looks and performs great!"
Case does not fit phone. Just lying around
Got this for my wife.  She really likes it.  The only issue is that the case is too think for the wireless charger to work correctly.
Item as described.
"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  This is a really nice quality leather wallet case.  It was easy to install and I was able to successfully put in a drivers license, debit card in a couple folded bills.  I really like how the lower pocket is see through for my license, something I haven't had with other wallet cases.  The magnet strap works well and easily slides in and out of my deep front jeans pocket.  My one suggestion would be to have the inner case that actually holds the phone, extend a letter farther to serve more as a bumper,  just in case it drops face down, while open.  Overall, very satisfied so far, And this will be my go to case when I go out and don't want a bulky wallet in my back pocket"
"Fits phone great! Love color and the Como .... my problem with it is it looked worn down, old, and peeling on back from day 1 .... thought it would look new for a while, but I have droped it a couple of times and phone was not hurt, phone being safe is more important than looks in my opinion."
I love my new phone case! I have had lots of compliments on it as well! I have had only had it for a month or so....how long it holds up is yet to be determined!
Love using it to watch tv on my phone. Clamp slips under the weight of my phone (iPhone 6 Plus). Would be nicer if it had a clamp that I could adjust at the base...but it wasn't very expensive...
I got this for a discount for an honest review.<br /><br />I like that it sticks to things that you can put a suction cup on. It so far has seemed slightly more reliable connection but it hasn't taken the water test like another speaker that I have. It seems pretty sturdy to kids for instance as mine like to walk around with it maybe throwing it a little around listening to things like &#34;teen Beach&#34; songs or &#34;Phineas and Ferb the Musical&#34;.
"Review:<br />The outer shell of the case is reminiscent of the Incipio Dual PRO iPhone 5 without the plastic backing. It feels very fragile and like rubber when touching the outer shell. I'm not 100% confident this will protect my phone when dropped (I guess we will find out overtime). The case is slightly heavier than the Incipio and almost feels like the weight of the morphie with the battery pack.  The design is a little too thick on the outer shell also. Would have preferred a thinner profile design on the outer case as this reminds me of the 1989 bulky phones. It doesn't compliment the elegant thin profile design of the iPhone 5 and does alot to hide it.<br /><br />For installation, contrary to what the instructions show, I felt like the case was going to break when attempting to peel off the soft outer rubber. Installing it back on was slightly difficult also. Took about 5 minutes to install the case and I missed one of the adhesive pieces so it peeled off my existing screen protector slightly.<br /><br />One thing I was very excited about was that it had a built in screen protector. Case is $15.95 and a screen protector alone is $5-7. So your basically getting a $10 case with a screen protector that will last you forever. I'm definitely not a fan of how the screen protector feels though. It feels like hard plastic and is difficult when you want to swipe your phone left or right. You can definitely feel the resistance. Tapping works fine without any issues. This is probably one of the drawbacks to a built in screen protector.<br /><br />The rubber covers over the vibration, AUX and lightning port are great for keeping the dust out also. They are a little difficult to remove which can be problematic if you are driving and trying to plug your phone in for some music. A better design would have been without the rubber covers.<br /><br />Now let's get to the part that I do not like at all. If a case is going to be both aesthetically pleasing and built to protect the phone, your better off building one for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. The interchangeable plates are great if you want to switch up the look of your phone. But if you own the iPhone 5 or 5S, you will have to look at the ugly camera circles on top built for the other version. In fact, there is a flaw design here. Why is there an extra circle to the left of the top one where the camera lens is? I checked the iPhone 5S and there is no camera lens in this position.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this case if you don't mind the nuisances that I have listed below. It's not a bad case but could be incredible if New Trent fixes the flaws that I have listed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Built in screen protector<br />+Interchangeable back plates<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Case feels like cheap plastic.<br />-Bulky<br />-Flawed camera hole design for both iPhone 5/iPhone 5S.<br />-Difficult to swipe left or right with built-in screen protector<br />-Rubber cover for AUX/Lightning port/Phone Vibrate difficult to remove."
"looks good, shows off the back of my (customized) phone. not sturdy enough to count on for too much protection, but better than nothing."
I literally had this product less then a month before every single one of the cables springs that keep the cord in the phone went out and now and the cord just falls out of my phone
This is THE best one I have come across and the built in aux cord is thick and sturdy. Great quality and the buttons to control the tunes are of good quality as well. The sound is no different then sliding in a store bought CD. Puts off the perfect amount of treble and bass.
"First let me start by saying I’ve purchased many Anker products over the years, however this PowerCore 20100 I am writing about was supplied as a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I buy Anker products because 1. They work as advertised,  2. They hold up (my first purchase was an Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh External Battery which has made two trips to Disney World, and I continue to use often),  3. Great warranty (18 Months) 4. The only time I needed their customer support it was top rate. (helping me diagnose an issue, sending me replacement, ultimately resolving the issue in a professional and courteous manner.).<br /><br />Now that we are carrying our iPads with us more often, my wife and I were looking for something with higher capacity than our Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh battery.The PowerCore 20100 appeared to be a good candidate, so I appreciate being sent the sample.<br /><br />My first opinions taking it out of the box are that it's smaller than I expected.  I mean based on the 2nd Gen Astro3's size and the PowerCore being almost twice the capacity I expected it to be twice the size.  While it is taller, it's skinnier, isn't any thicker and feels only slightly larger.  While the PowerCore is heavier (per Anker’s web page), it really isn’t that noticeable either.  Its nice if you need to carry it around.<br /><br />Anker's web site claims it can &#34;Charge an iPhone 6 seven times, a Galaxy S6 five times or an iPad mini twice.&#34;  Based on my usage, that is pretty spot on.  I was able to charge my 2013 Moto X about 8 times.  I was able to nearly fully charge both our iPad 2 and iPad Air 2 simultaneously  (which have larger batteries than an iPad Mini so its what I expected.).  The listing on Amazon has a chart reflecting the ability to charge an iPad Air 1.7 Times, so again, that claim reflects what I saw.<br /><br />Due to Anker's Power IQ technology, Voltage Boost, and 4.8A output, the PowerCore puts out the best current and voltage to charge all my devices at full speed, even when two devices are plugged in.  Charging my iPad Air 2 with the PowerCore 20100 (and an Anker Lightning cable) took the same amount of time as using the standard iPad adapter.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 does accept 2A input to charge it which helps with the recharge time. I can't say exactly how long it takes to fully recharge as I plugged the PowerCore into an Anker 40w 5 port Desktop Charger before going to bed, along with my other devices, and it was fully charged when I woke.  My estimate would be 6-8hrs to fully charge it.  While using the wall wart from my iPad Air 2 to charge the PowerCore overnight, it took a little longer than using the Anker charger (more like 7-9hrs).<br /><br />In the box you’ll find the PowerCore 20100, a 2ft MicroUSB cord, and a form fitting bag to hold them. Just as with the Astro3,  I put the PowerCore into the bag and left it there. I tucked the MicroUSB cable in side when walking around with it. The PowerCore has 4 LED’s to show how much power the battery has left, and two USB ports to plug in those devices you wish to charge.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 feels good in the hand and is easy to carry.  I used to to charge an iPhone 6, Nexus 6, 2013 Moto X, Samsung Galaxy S5,  iPad 2, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, Moto 360.  Unlike my Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh battery, the PowerCore 20100 did not charge my Nikon S8200 camera.<br /><br />If I had to state a “CON” or “draw back” it would be that I miss having the port for a 3rd device (the 2nd Gen Astro3 has 3 USB ports).  It was handy, especially when in Disney for my wife and I to plug our phones and digital camera in all at the same time.  However, since I would mostly use the PowerCore 20100 with higher capacity devices, like my iPads,  having two ports isn’t that bad.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 builds on the features that made me love my 2nd Gen Astro 3, while  increasing its capacity without adding that much size/weight. It provides higher output current (4.8A),  adds Voltage Boost,  so it charges my more power hungry devices faster and more often which is a major plus!<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 is a great External Battery for the road warrior who is away from an AC outlet for extended periods, or needs extra power for their higher capacity tablets."
I contacted Samsung customer service and I had bought the had I adapter 4.0 and they said I need the 3.0 and that didn't work with the Samsung tablet 4!!!! POS!!!
better to replace this then the phone screen. Yes will not go to the edges but covers the parts you need it to and is easy to put on.
"Save your money, a few dollars more and you can have a nice unit, lots of little things out of sync.like you have to figure out how to delet / add radio stations[ 3 week no luck], trying to get the right mounting kit is a frustrating exercise, instruction book is as clear as mud"
"Eh, it is better than a cracked screen, but like other reviewers noted you can only see the images head on.  If you are looking at an angle or tilting the screen you cant see anything.  Clarity is lacking.  But, it doesnt make sense to buy a high grade screen for a phone this old, when you could buy a whole new phone for the same price."
"Cons:<br /><br />- Sound quality is merely okay. A bit thin sounding--lacking bass. Not ideal for serious music listening.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Excellent phone headset (which is what I bought them for)<br />- Bluetooth stuff works great, with great range, and low confusion.<br />- They stay in my ears much better than other earbuds I've tried. I haven't tried running, but if I do, I'll update<br />- So nice not having wires everywhere! I like to pace when I'm on the phone, and now I can do it without wires everywhere."
"Practical, for keeping my phone safe with a beautiful print. Love it."
"Car Charger - Powerful 3 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Charger, Vano - Charge 3 Devices at Once at Full Speed - For Car, RV + Truck - DC Input 12-24V  FOR REVIEW<br />excellent multi purpose lighter port charger, you simply plug it in and plug it in it is that simple. you will find that this is  very high quality before it is ever removed from the box, i suspect you will not want to loose this device and will be angered slightly if such a event happens as well treat it with care my friends"
Directed electronics is very vague with info on install instructions but if you can figure it out this is a breeze to install. Just a few connections and your done.
Great product. Works well and we use it daily. So convenient.
"I bought the 16 GB and 2 gb ram, and it´s a pain in the neck, I´m coming from a nexus 5 with 2gb of ram and the difference is huge, the zenfone 2 got stuck if you´re actively using 2 apps ex: Google music and Facebook, the ram usage is almost all of the time over the 90% causing Lag, the OS drains really fast the battery(8 hours per charge) and that is really bad for a 3000 battery, and finally the latest update 40.61 bricked my cellphone(not rooted or modified), I have to say if you want this phone go for the 64GB and 4 gb ram because the 2 gb ram is a real pain in the neck..."
I love this case. It's saved my phone more times than I can count!
Cracked on the edge and cut my finger because it did not fully cover the whole samsung galaxy 6 edge. Used for 1 week
"I'm sure this is a good kit for other vehicles. But it Doesn't Fit the '94 S-10 pickup when installing a single DIN head unit. I have yet to find an adapter that works for this application on it's own. So I bought the Metra 99-4544, which also doesn't work. Going to Frankenstein the two."
This battery was a total fake! It charged but couldn't hold up a charge. I was so shocked to see that my old battery of over 24 months still performed much better than this junk I purchased. This battery is a complete waste of money and time. I charged it FULLY before I started using it and it still didn't deliver any better hope.<br />My advice: Don't buy this piece of worthless junk
"Nice case, fits perfectly. My son loves it"
"I found the IPhone 6 Armor Case not only attractive, a great buy but very duyone.rable.  I have dropped my phone several times and case did not suffer any damages, and the phone did not break or crack.  Well worth the money and makes a great gift."
Easy to install...no fuss...no bubbles
"Very functional, and makes driving and using the phone much safer.  Never have to dig into my pockets to get my phone when a call comes in while I am driving.  With a Bluetooth set up and the Macally, it is truly a hands off phone use."
These cases are great!!  They last a long time and don't show as much wear as some others.
Great fits my phone perfect.  Enjoy the just enough of the rubber it helps grip so my phone doesn't fall out of my pocket.
good Batt!
"The pink part gets dirty quickly but surprisingly the white part stays clean. I haven't found anything that will get the pink part clean again, a scrub with good ole soap and water doesn't cut it."
"Very handy, works great for a multiphone family."
"UPDATE September 6, 2015: Tab snapped off while inserting a new phone for use with this. It did not fall or get banged, It just snapped off with an iphone 5S. Also, it broke before we even had a chance to pair it with the phone. Therefore, lowering my rating to two stars. See picture.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: This monopod is almost identical to another I just reviewed but this one is about $5.00 cheaper and comes in this awesome hot pink color (my 12-year-old niece will go gaga over this) although the color is listed as red (it’s pink). The instructions are clearly printed on the back of the box and it’s a pretty straightforward set up. Assembly and pairing are simple and intuitive and you can setup and use this within five minutes of opening the box. The device has a charge already but comes with a USB charging cord and it’s probably a good idea to give it a full charge once it’s set up. That takes about an hour or so.<br /><br />The camera button is on the ribbed rubberized handle making it easy to hold and snap without much effort. On switch and mini USB charging port are o the base of the stick. The stick extends to about a yard in length. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver, FYI.  This applies to all selfie sticks, not specifically this one.<br /><br />It would be nice to add the port for a tripod but otherwise very nice.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
I've had no issues with this whatsoever. In his chores my son's iPhone five and my iPhone 6. I actually came to buy another one and cannot believe the negative reviews.
Love it.  Great quality. Shipping was fast too
"Cables work really good, the different sizes that you get in this assorted pack are a plus. I earlier got a pack of smaller ones, but having several cables in different sizes works better."
Excellent
"Now I can tell my phones from my son's...LOL It doesn't seem to be quite as securely on the phone as the original one I had, but I like it a lot."
"Otter Box makes great cases even though they are expensive. However i have noticed that if not used with the holster the rubber slip cover will stretch out relatively fast. In the case of this one, it took only 4 months. The one i had for my S4 lasted about 10 months. The Real Tree cases sold by Otter Box seem to have a better rubber cover than the standard Otter Box. That case lasted over 1.5 years, without any sign of wear and tear, until i got a new phone. The cost of the Real Tree case was $15-$20 cheaper but was a better product. I do not recommend these products anymore and have moved a better maker called Kecko."
I've purchased many screen protectors in the past and have always had trouble with installation. I had absolutely no problems with installation with this one. I followed the instructions and the screen protectors went on without a hitch on 2 phones. Great product!
"So, I had to get a replacement transmitter becuase the first one did not cooperate. But I send JETech a email stating that the transmitter didnt work and I wanted a refund. They offered to send me a replacement, once I got the replacement and connected it to my radio, IT WORKED! An amazing product, barely any static, just have to find a great signal on an fm station. BUY IT!!!!!"
"Thanks, UberZonClub.com"
after a few weeks of having this product I thought it was great although the discomfort on not being able to move the ear buds in the direction that you may like to make it feel comfortable. I rate it a 1 star on account after the first few weeks it died on me and no longer works...therefore all I need to say is thank you for the rip off.
Cases looked good and performed well - would suggest that the moulding to hold the phone be beefed up as the thinnest part breaks
They were delivered very quickly and looks exactly as pictured.  My only problem is I cant go across the room without the signal being lost. Probably will be looking for another pair with better range.
This is an adorable phone cover. It arrived in a very timely manner and I am impressed with the quality of the product.
Great USB Battery and wonderful value!
The color on the decal when I received it was dull.
"I am torn about this review because this wooden stand is great if you have multiple electronics as it solves the problem of how/where to charge everything without having your house look cluttered. Unfortunately, I have a few concerns which I will mention and perhaps the design can be modified for the future. If nothing else, I hope to help those who have multiple electronics understand what they can use this with.<br /><br />The first concern is that the watch charging stand is in an awkward spot. Because of its placement, it can't accomodate two nice long holders toward the rear (for someone with two iPods) so there is only one long slot and two short ones toward the front. This is fine if you are charging an iPod, Kindle and a phone, but not two larger electronics. This issue could be solved with just an inch more depth to the base. The slots could also be a bit wider to allow thicker covers on the iPad/iPhone. My iPad Air has a thin cover and fits fine, but my older generation iPad (which the children use) has a thicker leather cover which is barely able to be squeezed in.<br /><br />The second caveat is that the items you want to have reside here will need to be on their side in order to allow for the charging cord, and not upright like the stock photo shows regarding the phone. That isn't an issue for me, but I wanted to point that out.<br /><br />I manipulated the configuration to work for me by placing the smaller iPad on top of the second wooden wedge instead of in the groove (see the photo) and it seems to be holding up fine.<br /><br />Last of all, the silicone spacer protectors don't stick to the varnished wood. A little Super Glue would work to solve that problem.<br /><br />All in all, and the reason that I am torn, is that this is a decent, sturdy and nice-looking holder for a great price (I paid just under $16 for mine). There aren't many other three or four item holders out there that you'll ever see for a cost even close to this. So the bottom line is that if you aren't worried about a few minor modifications, this may be the holder/charging station for you.is that if you aren't worried about a few minor modifications, this may be the holder/charging station for you."
Give a four star FOR NOW ... BUT OVER ALL EXCELLENT (in Mr. Burns voice off the Simpson's) the package came LITERALLY in one week. Bought it on 23rd thurs. got it 29th Friday
Very good price.  Has excellent touch response and very clear.
"The Tronfy functions exactly as it's supposed to. The music quality may<br />not be the best, but for the cost of the<br />device, it just can't be beat."
Incredible case.
"on april 22, 2014 i purchased 3 of these items [via ebay]<br />1 is still working fine, i rarely use it.<br />2 of them just broke this month after a little over of 1 yr use:<br />-one of which i plug in and out often in the 12V cig lighter, the silver metal tabs on the outside of the unit broke. i was unable to fix it after opening. i find the design of those a little weak.<br />-the other i've kept in a car almost permanently. nothing looks damaged from the outside. so it's probably something internal.<br />i only use these to charge a Samsung galaxy 4 smartphone.  obviously for $9 bucks i can't really conplain.<br /> used it to charge a Samsung smartphone<br />Customer service of this company is great. Rma return process was fast and easy. They replaced the broke ones"
Great idea and design but the sticky pad doesn't support the weight of an iphone6 plus and keeps falling off
These headphones are uncomfortable in my ear the right one actually hurts  like hard plastic. They fall out of my ears frequently. Bluetooth connection occassionally cuts in and out but my biggest complaint is the battery life. It runs out of juice after just over two hours. I cant get thru two 75 minute workouts before the battery dies.
Product is as expected except for the color.  I ordered orange and instead of the darker shade pictured I received a much lighter shade of orange.  My daughter called it pink.
"This is a great phone.  Good Camera, great specs, works great, never had any problems.  I really like the Windows phone operating system, and this was about the best Windows phone you could get at the time for T-Mobile.  I got another one, used, for my daughter, and it works great, as well.  Nice design, too, and decent screen.  Fast.  I do wish it had an SD card slot, but I never ran into a space problem."
It never stayed more than30 seconds on my phone.  The case was never used because of that.  And the others that I purchased did the same.
"***IMPORTANT: DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN***<br /><br />Last swell Monday morning, I started the work week off by dropping my beloved Nexus 5 on the tile floor, and DESTROYED the screen.<br /><br />Groggy, unhappy, ordered a Nexus 6, my favorite case, and saw this tempered glass for sale for cheap on Amazon. Lots of reviews, didn't bother to read any of them (hindsight 20/20 this was my real mistake). I glanced over the notes and read that the screen cover did not go over the entire screen. Didn't read it fully, figured well ya, duh, cause if it did all the bumber cases would peel it?<br /><br />Fast forward a week, received the screen cover, and immediately thought they sent the wrong one. It doesn't cover a LOT of the edges. Went to the order page, and of course, this is supposed to be this way. I didn't knock stars off since it's my fault I didn't read. Initial impressions is this thing is very flimsy, I didn't even think it was glass, since I've never seen glass bend the way this does. Time will tell if it's any good. If I did it all over again I would get a regular screen protector so it covers more of the phone."
My boyfriend never uses a case for his phone but loves to use this one for obvious reasons. But deff a purchase to make if you want it for the same obvious reasons aha
I was sent the wrong size pouch.  I am looking forward to having the right size case.  It's just what I need to carry the charger and it's cables.
"In direct sunlight, the 8W version allowed my phone's battery to gain charge while streaming 4G video with the screen at full brightness. What more could you ask for?"
The only device that was able to hold properly my Nokia Lumia Icon phone.
"ship fast, good product and original"
It's a good case but it's hard to take off
Looks Great and works like it is suppose too. Great value for the price!
"I like the product very much. Having four sub ports and three outlet plugs is very convent when traveling. The bad is the USB ports require have a power button that spins a fan, which hums and annoys my spouse."
"I use this on my note 4 and my s6 edge plus and it works just like the factory charger.  I bought 2 of them, one for each vehicle. Awesome product. Would recommend for anyone that has a phone that can utilize the quick charge 2.0."
I tried the quick charge on my tablet an it work great. It gave me the extra boost that I needed.
"[[VIDEOID:b7d131804a5e4e6b5b74a31bbe162e3]] For the money, this dash cam is fairly decent. What I like about it is the compact size and high quality HD video. Check out the video posted with this review for actual footage taken with this cam. I was getting my car worked on at the auto shop, and it didn't occur to me until afterward that keeping tabs on what mechanics are doing with my car is a great application for this cam. I was watching the footage and wondering... when did I speed down the road like that, then run a stop sign while pulling a U-Turn??? Nope, my memory wasn't failing me, it was actually that dang mechanic driving my car like a jerk. So needless to say, I'm loving the auto record feature on this thing. I like that I can set how many minutes each clip should be, from 1 - 5 minutes each. The cam just keeps recording in these pre-measured increments, while continually deleting the oldest files. So the no-brainer, fully automated functionality is truly a bonus.<br /><br />Now for the stuff I don't like....<br /><br />The camera has a locking mechanism that attaches it to the suction cup windshield mount, aaaaand it really sucks. Every time I touch the cam to use any onscreen functions, or make a minor angle adjustment to the cam itself, it pops off of the base entirely. The suction cup sticks just fine, but the cam just falls off the mount waaaay too easily. The next quibble, is the user manual is terribly written. There's lots of sentence errors and jumbled words and confusion that just obfuscates more than it illuminates. The thing needs a serious rewrite, plus, some of the features aren't even mentioned, so I have no clue what some of it even does. Such as, parking monitor... um, okay, what's that? No clue. Sure, I could investigate, but why not just tell me outright?<br /><br />One saving grace, is the cigarette lighter power cable is nice and long. I was easily able to run a wired connection from my windshield mount, all the way to my center console where it plugs into. Cool. Then, after thoroughly testing it, I decided to pull the whole thing out in favor of a better dash cam that will be going up front instead. This one uses a mini USB connection, while the other uses a micro USB, hence the whole wiring had to come out. This one may get relegated to the back window; not sure yet. Oh, it's also worth mentioning that even though the screen is square, the video is indeed 16x9. The added screen space is for icons and onscreen feedback, which is actually a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good economy dash cam, but there's better to be had.  I was given this free in exchange for an honest review.Cool.

"This is a fantastic screen protector for my Galaxy S4! The screen broke on my phone a couple of weeks ago which made my old screen protector start to peel up from all the glass. So I took the old protector off, cleaned up the glass a little, and bought this new protector to put back on over the break. This screen protector comes with everything you need to get the protector sealed perfectly to your phone. It has the screen wipes, anti static clean sheets, etc. All the prep materials worked perfectly to clean and clear up my screen to get it ready for the protector. The protector was very easy to apply, and I love how I just had to set it in place and it attached quickly on it's own leaving only a few areas for me to smooth down. There isn't a perfect seal around the part of my screen that's the most damaged, but I wouldn't expect there to be, and it is staying on much better than my old one was. I love how thick the screen protector is as well! It's really a great quality screen protector and I am very happy with it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Great kit for camera repair.  Super easy to use and high quality.  I had my camera lens fixed in just a few minutes.
"Fits the phone perfectly. Sleek; not bulky. Great for price.  Negatives: one side was warped at arrival, and it is hard to push buttons on side if you don't have fingernails."
"Seems like a good sturdy case. Tested it for waterproofing and looks good. The problem is that the screen cover is plastic with a dotted grid pattern on it (I assume for transmitting touch).  The plastic doesn't fit tightly, so there are bubbles (more like high and low areas) and not every place you touch is recognized. For me, it's the space bar area, so that's supper annoying. I have to press super hard for it to recognize. The dots are not too noticeable when inside, but if you're in direct sunlight, the grid is overlaid on everything and the plastic has a dulling effect on the screen, so everything looks dingy and terrible. Inside, the screen causes a rainbow effect like you'd see in an oily puddle on a street after a rain. I want to protect my phone, but at what cost? In this case a severe reduction of screen resolution and of texting ability."
This cellphone is my best decision. I was comparing for a long time to select it and now I'm very happy for my decision
Loved this otterbox! Dropped it so many times and phone was in perfect condition. Only bad thing is that it got dirty so quick and it's hard to clean.
Worked as advertised. Need to charge an iPad while on holiday and did not disappoint.
"I debated with myself on whether I should do a 3 star review or a 1 star review, settling on 2 stars.  This phone is essentially great. It arrived in great condition, everything works and with an octa core, great sound, a nice design similar to the Galaxy S5, this phone seems like a great deal at 1/5 the price of the S5. There's only one flaw,  but it's so horrid that or makes this purchase not worth it.  It's 16 GB (or maybe 8?) with my own 32 GB micro SD and only 1 GB can be used for applications on your phone.  This is not enough for the apps you need, much less all your favorite apps. A lot of apps require being on your internal memory and you can't change how much of your internal memory you use for apps, unless you wanted to root your phone with a CHANCE of it working.  I returned it promptly and just got a Galaxy S5. The phones are close to the same size,  but due to slight differences, an S5 case will not work well with this phone."
"Great product. Works exactly as it's supposed to. Even comes with a warranty, which is nice. No complaints!"
"I've used a few cases for my galaxy note 3 but i've never tried a soft rubber case that felt as quality as this. the rubber is fairly dense and can stand up to a fair amount of abuse, specifically concrete. i've dropped my phone many times on concrete with this case and neither the phone nor the case received any noticeable damage. Another feature i really enjoy about this case is its ability to keep cool on the outside. my biggest issue with the note 3 is its tendency to heat up during extended periods of use, this case keeps the phone at a fairly cool external temperature making it very comfortable and pleasant to operate. The overall feel is good, the rubber feels dense, if i had to compare it to compare the rubber to anything id have to say it feels like a car tire, and high quality. If you like soft cases and want good protection for your phone this case is a definite candidate."
This is literally a photocopy of this case. It's not glittery or sparkly.  Do not waste your money because you have to pay for shipping there and back to return.
"Haven't tested it in the &#34;wild&#34; yet but after the test I put it through I'm 100% sure it'll hold up.<br /><br />Filled it with paper and held it down with weights underwater overnight. (Weights were necessary since it floats, which is another huge plus)<br />Next morning opened it up and confirmed it's totally waterproof. It's not exactly pretty but it's a bag so, whatever."
Bought this for my husband he loves it and it really does protect your phone- I got one from my daughter for Christmas last year and love it really protects my phone I have a tendency to drop it now and again- no damage so far- knock on wood
"It was wrong cases, I ordered white and black but I got black and pink ,now I can't use it."
It's a great phone case! It protects your phone and has an amazing fit. Thank you for the fast shipping 😘😘
Lots of fun.  I get comments on this cover all the time.
"I'm absolutely amazed that somebody figured out an intelligent and reliable way to apply screen protection to a smartphone. I have two S6 Edge+ phones, and I applied this protector on each one of them right before I went to bed. Zero bubbles and much fewer issues than any other protector I've used. Wraps perfectly around the edge and feels pretty good. Not as smooth as the ultra smooth glass on the Edge+, but definitely very high quality."
I love it and it came in the mail fast and I was just so happy an d yes it was amazing
Does what it's intended to do: kkep the Nuvi charged
Phone was shipped in a timely manner.  Looks brand new and works like a champ!  Very happy with this item!
BUY NOW !!
"I am forever forgetting to charge my cell phone, and nw, no matter were I am, I can charge it..  Stays charged for more time then all the others I checked out....  thanks."
I love this case!!  I had the bigger Otterbox case and it was too bulky for my taste but this is perfect.  It has even taken a tumble down a flight of stairs and there is only a scratch on the phone case and my iPhone had no damage.  Will be purchasing more.
It is an awsome product. Protect your iPhone well and the material feels great.
"Holds 2 credit cards and 1 driver's license. At first I was skeptical about it's ability to hold these 3 items without them slipping out, but they do stay in the holder. Sometimes it is hard to get one of my credit cards out, but that's a good thing. The back does scratch easily, but I don't view that as a problem or a defect. It is a natural part of wear-and-tear from my perspective. And it's purely cosmetic."
By far the EASIEST screen protector to put on! It comes with everything--the wet wipe and microfiber cloth AND sticker duster helps make adhesion easy and quick with NO bubbles. Protects the screen and still makes it easy to swipe and touch as if nothing were on it at all.
"Best phone case I've ever owned, and classy. Only problem is the little band is made out of the same stuff as hair ties, and my band has entered the final stages of it's life. I recommend the magnetic one instead (Search for magnetic genuine oiled leather case for nexus 6)"
I love having this power charger!  Does a great job charging my Droid turbo !
"The only thing I can review at the moment is that the case looks as described. I only plan on using it during the 4th of July.  I do wish it had a snap on front to protect better, my bad for not reading description better as the one I had originally seen was front and back."
"It came in a timely manner, and is durable, but is a little hard to get off your phone once you put it on. Also, the picture is starting to peel off already, but it is serving it's purpose."
this was the worst purchase I have made with Amazon yet.  it worked for one charge and that was it.
protects the phone against the hardiest/toughest of tests.  brutal ownership by teenage boys is not enough to thwart the magnificant protection of this beautiful and functional case.
Complete garbage!! Can't someone make a screen protector without having to spray some liquid on it and make it look like crap?? Waste of $$
Charging space is way to small and overheats if you are able to find that sweet spot and actually get your pho e to charge.
"Screen protector is very different, but other than that it fits perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy s6 edge. I love how it protects the edges too."
"The screen cover was very well-packaged, had all the items in the box needed to do a good job, had clear instructions, was simple and easy to install, and so far is working very well."
Very clear plastic. Seems to be a quality product. Fits well and offers added protection without the bulk of some phone cases.
The Soundpeats are great for listening to music when you're running or working out.  But when you're talking on the phone they pick up all the background noise and it's sometimes hard to hear or understand what they are saying.
"Awesome case,  just as good if not better then otter box."
It had good reviews so I bought it.  I've tried to tighten it hard but it won't stay upright.  Little bumps make it move and I certainly can't use it on a mountain bike.
Works as expected. Unfortunately the metal clip may give your skin a rash if you are allergic to certain alloys. Even with that I can't complain at the price.
otter box  said it is a fake......will not warranty this
"Great case, I accidentally ordered this one, but needed the 6 not the 6 plus. my exchange was quick and easy."
"I had a problem with the holster where the end broke shortly after I purchased the product. I notified the seller and they were very professional. They replaced the holster with no additional charges. I do recommend that any individual purchasing this product to be cautious with the holster. If the phone is not attached, the ends of the hoster can catch on to the ends of desks, chairs, etc when you stand from a seated position. Other that that, I am fairly satisfied with the product, and my purchase experience with the seller."
This is fantastic.  Tunes in the shower are the best.
"This is actually worse than the battery it was ordered to replace.  From some back of the napkin calculations, I'd guess this has ~60% of the capacity that it claims. I would not recommend."
"I bought this AC charger because it is UL listed.  A UL listing means that the design and manufacture both meet safety standards for protection against shock or fire.  If your adapter is not UL listed it could shock you or damage your phone/ipad/mp3 player.  A listed product has a UL file number printed on it. Verify the listing by looking it up on the UL website.  Listing by CSA, TUV, VDE, or ETL are just as good as UL.  Unfortunately, a CE mark means nothing as far as safety. BTW, this charger works great !"
"This is a pretty standard aftermarket third party Apple-Certified MFI Lightning cable for iPhone 5/6 and newer iPads.<br /><br />This is 1 meter long (3.2 feet approximately), the same as the factory Apple cables. I have this in Yellow color.<br /><br />Plugs on both ends feel secure. This has worked fine with each of my various Apple products, with no issues. It's also worked with both my car charger and wall chargers.<br /><br />The MFI plug on this is relatively small, like the original Apple plugs, so I haven't had any difficulty getting it to fit into my various iPhone case port openings. That's convenient.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. This just works, and works fine. Seems well made. No complaints.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop around. Happy travels, everybody."
"works good but you have to have the space for it to sit, could not use it in my 2014 ford van nor my 2007 explorer"
I like the look and feel of the case. The only reason for the two star rating was the camera flash halo. Once you place the phone in the frame there is a distance between the frame and the case. This small space creates a shadow (halo) when using the flash for pictures. It renders this case useless when taking flash pictures. I ended up having to cut a small piece of the case off so the halo could be eliminated. I only did so because I do like the case. I'd save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a case.
I prefer this band over the Misfit branded one. The Shine slides in through the back and it's more secure. Versus the Misfit band where the Shine constantly pops out all the time!<br /><br />Only thing that bothers me is that the buckle is silver and not gold like the face ring. The black straps also have a tiny 'M' pattern on it. Overall good quality and I know I won't lose my Shine!
This is by FAR the best charger i have ever purchased. it feels and is very sturdy. and i love how fast it charges my iphone. 5 Stars no doubt.
"Great case, for the price I love it. My son has dropped it several times and my phone has not gotten any scratches on it"
I ordered 4 cases for our summer family vacation. Each case worked GREAT!
I'm not too happy with this case...its mad slippery...the back feels a sticker on cardboard. When I put the phone in the gummy part of the case does not sorround the case because of the hard shell...in a couple weeks I will put my old case back on...this is garbage.
"Took a minute to get used to it, but it works very well.  I have played three rounds since it has arrived.  Shot 89 and 82 respectively.  Very accurate and it has seems to have all of my local clubs downloaded.  Would make a great gift for the avid golfer."
"The seller is amazing, the product, not so mych, I bought 2, the 1st one was replaced immediately, still waiting on this one to be processed... Not a great tablet at all, I am thinking I'd rather have my money back rather than the replacement, but let's play it out and see how it goes...don't But this tablet if you want durability and longevity, neither of them lasted a week before they went out... Very dissappointed in these tablets"
"It only work for 2 days, sent back and was able to receive my full return without any problems from the manufacturer"
It's clear. It was cut correctly. Good job makers of cut plastic thingy.
Excellent device for taking selfies on a selfie stick. The Bluetooth pairing is superb. Once paired to a device it can't be paired with another unless it's reset. This feature is good in a way since it always connects with the paired device instantly every time. I'm really happy I bought this after I've used the cheap Chinese makes which keep disconnecting all the time and add to the frustration. Just wish it came with a long around the neck sling...it's so small I'm afraid I might loose it. 😁
This is an exact OEM part to update my 2014 Ford F-150 Nav. system. It has the most up-to-date information available from Ford at this time for the in-dash map.  Simple & easy to change out the old SD card & replace it with the new SD card at less than half the price of the dealer price.
Truly fit my device.  I was afraid that the size may be not right.
"Great product, fits my cell in it's case, which will make it easier, and protect my phone better. Camp on time as promised."
"The speaker is a little bit on the tinny side, but for the size and price of the radio one can't complain.  A couple of things I don't like about it is the default setting.  I bought it for the radio, and I have to hit the FM button after turning it on in order to get the radio to come on, and at this point often get blasted by sound or have to turn the volume up.  The volume control is too sensitive.  But all in all it does a great job."
good phone<br />really good looking<br />...sometimes it gets really hot
Product as described.  Bluetooth hooks up to my cellphone for hands free driving.  This device actually attaches to the sun visor of your car.  So it is out of the way.  It is a little bit thick.
"Got this for my Samsung S6.  Easy to install and hoping it does the job if I drop my phone.  However, the instructions within the packaging require a magnifying glass which is really annoying !!<br /> I agree with other posts that its easier to install it horizontal instead of vertical.  Within the instructions it tells you to put two red sticky tabs at either corner to help with alignment which was not useful at all.  This screen protector isn't that hard to put on the phone."
"So far I've been very happy with this adapter.  I have used all of the different USB variants that this cable provides and have been very happy with it.  I've not tested the charge speed since typically I am just leaving the units overnight so I can't speak to that.  I assume that when you are charging multiple devices at the same time, the charge rate will decrease.<br /><br />About the only think I can complain about is the length of the adapter.  It is extremely short and so I had to buy a little 6&#34; or 1' extension just to get it from the plug to our counter top.  Would buy again!"
Broke after 2 weeks. The cord is still fine but the metallic top that goes around the male piece slides off. Bad glue
Great supplement to any Garmin bundle.  Price was better than I could find locally and it got to the house in a reasonable amount of time.
Looks perfect and fit well.  The trouble is the material it was mad with somehow negatively affected the reception of the phone.
"Using the Tough Claw together with a ball Diamond base, Garmin Nuvi Cradle, and double arm socket to mount GPS in a RZR UTV side by side.  System is very solid and offers a great range of adjustability.  Can mount to roll bar or on the passenger &#34;T&#34; bar and adjust so driver or passenger can see and operate the GPS."
"I was beguiled by the many positive reviews to believe that this was possible. I consider myself fairly handy with most things and have played around with electronics before. Having now destroyed one phone, I may be able to fix one in the future but I doubt I'd try again.  With great patience and care, I think that the LCD/Digitizer had cracked before I'd even begun to get the screen separated.  I'm sure this is a fantastic kit, but unless you have absolute confidence in your abilities and some experience, I'd recommend against this unless you are fully willing to trash the phone.  At the very least - back up anything you may want to say. Lulled into a false sense of security, I neglected to do so.  As of 9/8: Upon reflection, while my experience was far from successful, the kit itself was great. There were a multitude of tools for use and all of great quality. Further, the immediate response from the seller after I posted my review was amazing. While they aren't able to miraculously restore my phone, they have gone above and beyond all my expectations to make it as right as they can.  I would strongly recommend them as a seller.  And if you know what you are doing, then I can recommend this kit."
I really loved the case. The case is almost addicting and I love the thickness of it. It holds really well on the phone.
"I was very skeptical and used it this weekend to charge my phone, my wife's phone and friends phone.  (All iPhone 6). I went camping and in the beginning it charged my phone fine and fast however I would go back every once in awhile to check on it and it would stop charging even in direct sunlight and would say device is not supported.  I would have to keep unplugging and re-plugging it in to start charging again.  Later that day I tried charging my phone again and it stopped at 75% and wouldn't go beyond it for an hour in direct sunlight.  It looked like the panels were warping slightly.  I tried plugging my phone to my car and it's as if the unit did something to my iPhone where it froze from charging beyond the 75%!?.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone and luckily it started charging again.<br /><br />If I have to keep checking I it to see if it's charging and re-plugging it in to make it work leaves me with no confidence in a real world emergency situation.<br /><br />Sorry thought it was going to be great, but sending it back!"
"This is nice, however, didn't fit everything and didn't organize it as well I was hoping. It's a well made product, and very reasonably priced. I was looking for a travel case that could organize all of my electronics, chargers, ear phones, etc. This fits my chargers and ear phones, but not all of the devices. I used to carry everything is Crown Royal bags, which I decided is not extremely professional at work, so this definitely a step up!"
"Worked great, used for mud riding on my ATV with no issues. Got soaking wet multiple times, was covered in mud multiple times, just washed it off in the water.. Still able to use the cameras without issue, speakers sound good, does make incoming voice quality through top speaker worse but it's expected. S-Pen latch feels weak, and the stand on the back is hard to get out and feels cheap - BUT that's not a problem at all, for the price and protection quality it's great. 10/10 would buy again.  **UPDATE** I put it in an ice chest with a couple inches of water and within 30 minutes the case had filled with water. I did notice that the latch for the S-Pen had broken but still functioned. I believe this is why the case leaked. I didn't mean to leave it in the ice chest and my phone is okay so I'm not upset. I've noticed in other reviews that the S-Pen latch is faulty and breaks easily. I will just silicone it shut, I only intend on using this case on weekends when I know I'm going to be around water and rough with it."
worked great for vacation. didn't have to carry wallet and phone. Only minus is you can't carry more then a few dollar bills but if you're like me and mostly carry cards it is fine.
"Right after delivery, I opened the product box and found there's some scratches touched up. Also, because the ear speaker sealing is put inside, sticking side can be seen from out side and it's looking bad. maybe because of those, it was quite big discount.<br />However, moreover such cosmetic issue, display response became so bad, it doesn't even my pass code to get in to iphone.<br />I need to press display very firmly but still hard to make it work so that it became too much stressful/annoying using iphone with this case; structure isn't bad but iphone display response became too bad to use. I decided to return this item."
"I wear it everyday and it really provides incentive to keep up the number of steps taken each day.  The sleep tracker is very interesting to analyze sleep patterns as well as give a little &#34;nudge&#34; to help you get your goal amount of sleep each night.  I do not use the food/calorie counting aspect as I find my diet too difficult to track due to erratic eating habits. The battery holds quite nicely for approximately two weeks.  This style is worn easily and without fear of losing it as happened to me with a new Fitbit that I had on for less than three hours - gone!  Unfortunately, however, I believe this style is being discontinued which, IMO, is a mistake on the part of Jawbone.  Get it while you can."
Update:  Since my last review Amazon replaced my unit And the new unit is working like an Anker should. Am updating the rating because of both Amazon as well as Anker's stellar customer support.<br /><br />Well guess its my luck this baby will not take a full charge. Left it overnight still only 3 LED will light up and charging a phone will drop it down to two ....feeling a bit let down specially with my upcoming trip ...
I'm not comfortable with taking over a radio station someone might be listening to but then again at least it works lol
"This is a great case, it has a good snug fit on my phone without limiting access to anything  on the phone. All of the buttons are still functioning and the case doesn't block my camera. It was very easy to install on my device, it also came with instructions to help you out. It hasn't blocked any reception, I still hear crystal clear on my phone. I ordered a clear grey phone case because I like to keep things simple, but there is alot of other color choices to choose from. This Phone Case by COLLEN is a quality phone case.<br /><br />(I purchased this phone case at a discounted price in exchange for my fair, honest & unbiased review of the phone case after using it.)"
"If you wear hearing aids, this device is worthless. Even with telecoil, the volume is lower than normal and it does not separate background noise, obviously. Can't speak for normal hearing users."
"This is adorable, but the rhinestones to do stay on the phone. I really like this phone case, but pretty soon it will be all silver.  The rhinestones started falling off the first day I put my phone in it."
Purchased this one for my son.  &#34;Most awesome phone case ever&#34; is his remark.
Works great but the bad side is that in sunlight you barely see anything on your screen. Also there is no cut out for the light sensor so you have to change the background light manually. Customer support was great though
"This product was advertised as flush mount, but it sticks out of my car lighter socket by over an inch.  It would have been nice to get actual product dimensions on the selling page, but the only dimensions were the packaging."
These preformed very terribly. Barely covers the screen company responded with responded with asking for photos and saying there was nothing wrong.. That's how the designed them.
I replaced a leather band with this strap and very happy.
"battery performs as needed, but it's not the Official Genuine battery. It does not match the battery that came with my phone, which was purchased new from a Verizon dealer."
"Beautiful and functional ~ pockets are large enough for Galaxy Note 4, bluetooth, ID, cards, cash.  Very soft and flexible."
"At first I loved this case, it was exactly what I was looking for.  It had a good fit and the kickstand worked perfectly.  After the first couple months, the thin plastic broke off above the volume buttons, no biggie.  6 months later, this case is like a 20 year old car in Arizona, the plastic is extremely brittle and new pieces seem to break off every time I use it.  No longer happy with my purchase."
I had an adapters similar to this one that I bought at Walmart; I had it for 3 months before I broke it out of frustration and anger. It did this annoying thing were it would continuously skip and create the most obnoxious noise. Ended up throwing it out of the window. So I had to buy another so I could still listen to music. This is a huge improvement! I've had it for 3 weeks and I am very happy with my purchase. It doesn't skip or make weird eerie noises. It also doesn't randomly eject when ever it feels like it. Has great audio. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has anger issues. Might be two bucks cheaper at Walmart but it'll save you a lot of frustration in the future.
"So I was reluctant at first to get this phone.  Though I got the best deal and price for it from amazon.<br /><br />First, the screen is amazing! The edge to edge screen makes it a lot better than any scree. And with the edge, 5 phone callers can be assigned in different  colors.<br /><br />Second, I like the metal back,"
"Phone keeps over heating and shutting off, even when not in use.  I know it was a refurbished phone but it obviously wasn't checked before sending out."
"Seemed to work well for two days.  Then seemed to be intermittent.  Then stopped charging, although indicator lamp stayed on.  Lamp showed blue constantly once it stopped working."
Not excited with this one.  It has a cheap rubber I feel to it and it slips off too easily...made a mistake in ordering this.
much thinner than i expected but still appears to be good protection for my phone.
"Beautiful, powerfull and everything in nicely designed box. This is the best looking power bank I had. Express shipping. I can recommend it to anyone who's got bigger smartphone. I'm using Nexus 6 and it can be charged almost 5 times. My personal hero ;)"
"THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE MOUNT THAT MATTERS.  SLEEK , STRONG and USEFUL.  Portrait or landscape.  All phone sizes.  Just stick the magnet on the back of your case (not the back of your phone) and  you're set.  A+"
The bag that was supposed to hold everything was broke when I received it not to mention one of the flowers was already broke as well.
"I bought this several months ago, still working great!!  I like the fact that both USB's are 2.1A."
"A little on the flimsy side. When I received the mic,  the built in speaker was loose and rattling around in the plastic case. I had to disassemble the unit to fix the issue. Works fine otherwise."
"This product doesn't seem to be working properly with my Kindle Fire.  It takes about 2 days for my power to reach 100%, I'm not very pleased with this product."
It works as expected.  Fast charging for my Notes 4 cellphone.
The overall looked the mount is good. Sleek and easy to use. Definitely holds my iPhone 6. The only problem is that it keeps falling off of my dashboard. Not sure why since the base is very sticky and I lock it in place.
Hole for the camera is too small.  When you take night photos the flash bounces off the case and ruins the photo.<br />Chinese Junk.
I think it's very nice but poor quality. After having it only a few weeks and not even putting it in my pocket it's starting to fall apart!!! I'm not to happy about it
"Fits my Note 5 perfectly. Yeah... It doesn't go all the way to the edge of the phone but like the description says, the screen on the phone rounds off so that's not really possible. In my opinion, the fit is perfect and the glass is super clear. I was able to install it within 5 minutes with no issues and I am very happy with the purchase."
"It does the trick and holds my iPhone6 tightly to my arm while exercising, but it was very frustrating trying to change my music or check my running app while in the armband. It seemed the sleep button was constantly hit from the pouch while attempting to navigate through my phone causing me to unlock it several times before I can do what I was intending to."
The phone remains slim unlike other cases. It comes off easily when needed to replace the phone battery. Great case!
"Despite the item description, this case does NOT hold an iPhone 6 Plus with an Otterbox Defender cover on it. Wasted my time. I paid for one-day delivery as I really needed it    Update: If you have an iPhone 6 plus with an Otterbox Defender case this one works great. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NTURFJ2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
Such bad quality. Did not protect my phone when it fell. My phone shattered completely as well as this cover. Have to pay $150 to replace the screen
"Fits amazing, looks amazing, but the back is a FINGER PRINT MAGNET. Which I can not stand. Might be returning."
Excelent 100%
"This is a great deal for anyone who needs a spare phone for emergencies.  Or if you are a spy with not a lot of money, and you need a cheap &#34;burner phone&#34; to make calls without worrying if the NSA can track your location, the LG-305 is an excellent choice.  But, all kidding aside, I purchased this phone because I misplaced my Samsung S5, and since I was leaving for NYC in a couple of days, I didn't have time to look around the house for my cell phone.  The LG-305C is very small and I was able to purchase a small holster style case in Manhattan for $5.00  My only issue I have the phone is that a &#34;voice&#34; repeats every command I use for this phone.  Now if I really was a spy, that would be a dead give-away if I was hiding from my pursuers.  Other than that, the LG-305C is a great little phone and the &#34;Triple Minutes for Life&#34; an added bonus."
"I’ve been using stereo Bluetooth headsets for listening to the music in the gym ever since the first such device came out and the mp3 players started including Bluetooth as an option. In my opinion there is absolutely no other way to unobtrusively listen to the music while you exercise. However, all the headsets that I’ve used so far have one major problem: they all fail due to the moisture within a very short period of time. So far I have not had any such problems with these headphones, but only time will tell if they manage to be an exception to the rule.<br /><br />The sound quality of these headphones is one of their main attractions. First of all, no wireless headphones of this size will ever be able to deliver the deep, clear sound that you expect from some of the higher end headphones, but these headphones sound richer and more vibrant than almost all the headphones I’ve tried before. They were on par or better than most brand name headphones.<br /><br />These headphones seem to feature passive noise canceling technology. They are pretty good at minimizing the outside sound while in use, and even when they are turned off. Several times I was in a situation where someone tried to talk to me while I was wearing them, and I had to take them off in order to hear what the person had to say.<br /><br />These headphones are probably one of the most reductionist ones that I’ve seen. They are just made out of two oversized earbuds and a connecting cord between them. This is the ideal form factor for the sports headphones. The earbuds are pretty large and stay firmly in my ears even during the moderately fast runs. The extra sports ear cushions make the fit very snug. The connecting cord loops around the ears but they weren't as tangle free as I expected, which gives the headphones extra stability. I’ve used them while running for several days and they stay firmly in the position. They score high on both the form factor and the comfort level.<br /><br />I have not used these headphones much for phone calls. In general I find Bluetooth headsets to be quite inadequate for voice phone calling. The mic on these headphones also seemed below average, but then again, I was not going to use them for telephony anyways, so this aspect of the headphones neither bolsters nor diminishes a case for them.<br /><br />I will be monitoring these headphones for the foreseeable future. If they manage to survive a year of use in the gym, and their battery power does not significantly diminish over that period of time, then they might be the best overall sports Bluetooth headphones that I have come across.<br /><br />**** Product provided free for review purposes. ****e not used these headphones much for phone calls.

"Quality and super fast shipping. Product is plain black which is fine with me figured I could decorate it my own way then. Very good quality with a nice fit, doesn't slip around at all. A little bulky but not bad at all and you will get that with any phone cover. I am so pleased with my order. Definitely would order from this company again without hesitation."
"Purchased this charger because the usb connector on my nexus 7 (2nd gen.) became loose and the usb cable would not stay connected to charge the unit. It took around 4 hours to go from 5% to 100% charge. It doesn't come with the adapter, but I had a 2.1 amp 5v adapter that I had purchased for another device and it works perfectly. It does exactly what it says it does and is a good value for the price. This was a lot less expensive than fixing the usb port on the tablet and I can use it to charge any qi enabled devices I buy in the future. It is also conveniently portable."
Two of the Chargers work great. One is loose and will not stay plugged in. It falls out of the receptacle.
"NOT WATERPROOF!<br />Do not buy this case! I bought this case to take my phone with me on a white water rafting trip. I made sure to test the case thoroughly before actually trusting it with my phone. It was in the raft the entire time and never got wet except for the occasional splash. The case didn't last at all and soon the case was trapping water in more than it was keeping water out.. Afterwards, I took my phone out of the case asap and it was completely drenched. There was even water inside the camera underneath the lens! It's truly a miracle that my phone is still somewhat operational. I would not recommend this case to anyone!"
"Magnet is super strong.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the strength of the magnet, it sometimes unclips from the vent when I go to pull my phone off.  Otherwise a very good product."
Exactly what we wanted. Sturdy.
"I own several items by Cyverlandtron and they have all been great. So when I had the opportunity to test their dual (2.1 amps & 1 amps) port USB car adapter at a discount for my review I jumped on the opportunity. This adapter is made of plastic but are very well built and strong. I dropped mine on the concrete driveway and it did not break. They are also nice and small in size so it does not take but to much extra room.<br /><br />I tested the car adapters against my house charger to see how fast these thing really were. To my surprise the estimate charge time my phone (Samsung Galaxy 6) gave me was within a minute of the house hold charger that came with the phone. When I plugged a second phone in (iPhone 6) the estimated charge time only dropped by 1 minute. So the quick answer is these car adapters are just as good as charging in the house with the chargers that came with the phones. I like that they have a blue light that lets you know when they are plugged in and charging.<br /><br />Quick pros:<br />Fast charging times<br />Charge 2 devices at once<br />Blue light to let you know it is working<br />Strong, well built<br />Small in size<br />Will charge apple products<br /><br />I Recommend this car adapters."
"This is a great gadget that is very important to carry while traveling.<br />I used it while taking a vacation and had no issues at all. it is shock proof, water proof and dust proof . it charges very well and though it took little longer to charge my note 4 but well at least i had backup. I had no electricity outlet for miles and miles but that didn't worry me.its a  high capacity rugged 10200mAh power bank (2.1A Power Output) that is perfect for smartphones, tablets and portable electronic devices.<br />This is cute looking and has  built in flash light , compass and Carabiner. Perfect for people like me who love to spend most of my time outside.<br />I was provided this at discounted price in return for my honest opinion."
"I absolutely love this case. I like that I can use the case to prop up the phone in order to watch videos without holding the phone. I am satisfied with this purchase. The texture of the case took a little while to get used to. Overall, this is a sturdy and protective case for my phone. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Perfect. Recommend it highly. Fit my iPhone 5s to a t. Easy to install. Love especially the High Impact Hybrid Armor Silicone material. I give it 5 stars because it is such a great case. My only wish is that it would be provided in more than the red color. And after two other tries with buying other VAKOOS &#34;suggested&#34; cases in the same ad by the seller as having the same silicone material, I can tell you for a fact they do not."
This product has helped in my travels across Europe not only did it charge my iPhone 6+ rather quickly (30/40 mins from 10% charge).
I like this headset and use it regularly.  They connect easily with my phone and sound good (not great)  They are fairly comfortable to wear for long periods.  Good value for the money.
My first impression of this case was that it was sleek and modern looking. However I had this case for less than 24 hours and when I took my phone out of my pocket the gold bumper was cracked in half. This case is not meant to protect a phone what-so-ever.
"Don't waste your time or money. Purchased through Amazon, the original and the replacement one never worked. Even went to my local Best Buy and tried to buy one there, the Geek Squad couldn't get it or another one they opened from the shelf to work."
My wife loves it. Helps keep it of the counter and saves space since you can place items closer to it without worrying about getting burned.
Works great! I have dropped my phone twice and this saved the screen. Only issue is bubbling a little on the right side of screen
"Looks great, BUT lasted a little over a month. The lightning port broke while I was unplugging it... I'm never buying Aduro products again."
This case broke in the first week.  It also did not protect my phone and my Iphone cracked.  The other Incipio cases are better.
"I own 4 Anker products and have never been dissapointed. Their products are over-engineered and are built to last. I was contacted by customer service a year or so ago about an issue some customers were having with one of the multi-port charging adapters. Mine was fine but they offered, and delivered, a free upgraded versionhe charger. How are you going to beat that?"
"Perfect fit for the Samsung 1900. This also fits the 1700, this is my secind one and worth the price."
"Never written a review before, but after reading so many others, figured I had to post as well.<br /><br />This 100% does not work the way it is intended, I'm now looking for a new radio that has an AV jack so I can just plug my IPhone directly into the radio.  This product is beyond frustrating, could not find a single station that would play music without a ridiculous amount of static.  Paid $30 at Target, will be returning this product ASAP."
nice quality fit great. how much it will protect not sure. had for over a month still in super shape. prob. ships from like china takes a long time to get. but it was worth the wait for a fan who was at the last 3 shows!!!!!
Works great with my ATT Note 4. Has a large coil that my Note 4 see's as soon as it's placed on it.  The size gives my Note a sturdy base to sit on so I can tap anywhere on the screen and not knock it off the charger.
Way too big for my S6. Extremely disappointed
"I was fortunate enough to buy this while it was in its promotional launch, but now I'm buying a second for my other car. Great quality, simple and easy to use, and extremely convenient. I've used other similar phone holder devices that either slid around or the magnet wasn't strong. This one is great! Thanks!"
"This is a great quality product.  There is not a lot of protection on the front side of the phone case, it has a low smooth front profile, but the wallet portion is great and holds a great deal very securely.  Despite the low profile, it is a great design.  We will definitely be purchasing another one."
"Good product, not perfect, but none have been, to date. A hint about separating the well made halves would have been helpful for the age and experience impaired ;)"
Excellent
Here we are five years after I bought this phone and I'm still using it as a back-up. It's been all over the world and keeps on ticking like it was brand new!
"So far, I love my speaker. Out of the box it was almost fully charged - it was great to be able to use it right away. Incredibly easy to install and setup, and day-to-day connecting and playing music is a breeze. While I didn't like the next/previous and volume buttons being the same, I've gotten used to it and actually appreciate the multiple use of the buttons."
Works great I got it for my moms iPhone 6 and she enjoys the style and protection this case offers
Got 2 in today. Very Please so far. The Magnets may very well be stronger than the Pebble Cable. Charged my watch no problems
"VERY GOOD CASE JUST ONE PROBLEM UNABLE TO USE YOUR FINGER PRINT TO LOG IN WITH THIS CASE, HAVE TO REMOVE CASE OVER ALL VERY NICE CASE"
"Everything is good except that the Glass doesn't lay flat all the way, leaving some air pocket at the edge. It doesn't matter too much because it's in the edge of the screen."
Upscale quality.  Excellent value.  No worries on this purchase!!
Terrible product. I was initially impressed as it worked as it should but it quickly stopped working and I had to purchase another product from another vendor.<br /><br />Stopped working in less than 4 months.
Definitely worth the money!  I haven't really pushed it to the limit but it charged my phone pretty quickly!
Just received my  case about a week or so ago and seems  very sturdy.  No problems so far.
no problems<br />arrived sooner than expected
Good quality with cheap price. I always charge 4~5 phone & tablet but it shows me good performance every time.
Very happy with this product.
"I love this little speaker! It has better sound than other speakers in this price range, and I like the way it functions better too. I had an older version of this very speaker which went bad on me, and Noria reached out to me after my bad review, and sent out a newer version to me free of charge. This newer version has a gentler &#34;speaker on&#34; sound, and doesn't have a &#34;speaker off&#34; sound, which I'm really glad of."
Just as I expected. Terrific phone. I'm sold on HTC phones.
"Great product, very durable. The only issue I have is that it is not easy to take off and put back on. Still worth it though for the money."
Took it to our Europe vacation and loved it. It was sturdy enough for our SONY camera and worked great to take photos using the camera's self timer.
"Great, but if you use wireless or NFC a lot, this will block those features since its made of metal."
"Item came in the scheduled amount of time and has worked well for me. I can see where the armband would be small for people with bigger arms. My biceps are about 16 inches around and it fits nicely, but people with arms a little bigger than that may have trouble with the product fitting. That being said, I have no complaints or any problems with the product."
loved this case! I didn't like the flap at the bottom that covered the charger port. But other than that it was great
Gift for my husband. Perfect fit.
"Unfortunately this has the halo effect around the edges where the glass is to big and goes over the curves of the screen, which i did not mind the look of because it was such a nice feeling protector. BUT this lifting of the edges allowed dust/sand to get in under the glass, and cause it to get several cracks that crossed the screen after only a few days. Skinomi says they have lifetime replacements, but i filled out one of their claim forms on their website, and after a month of no response, i sent another. Still no response. As far as i can tell, their customer service is non-existent, two months of waiting and nothing. Extremely disappointed in this company, and a waste of money."
Very handy charger. Note Edge eats up batteries. I need at least two full charges to make it through busy day. This charger always allows me to have a charged battery handy or quickly charge a backup. Works off 12V too!
Fit perfectly ! The array of colors were very nice.
"The screen protectors were find and the stylus, but the phone snapon case was very cheap and did not fit.  I threw it away."
It just sticks to stuff.....great product!
Wifey here. I got a coupon for this so I wanted to leave feedback in return. This is a great little device. It plugs easily into the car and has two USB charger slots. Does exactly what it's supposed to do. I may get another one for our other car.
Great case I love the kick stand very sturdy also
"Great case as usual. This is my third phone with a Diztronic case. I keep buying them because they always fit great and look good. Button covers are good, too."
Excellent case!  Really good quality.  I have to say that I was surprised at just how well made it is considering it's so cheap.  It feels nice - not as if it'll fall apart quickly.  It's protected my iPod very well (I've dropped and bashed it a few times already!).  I would definitely buy this brand again.
"My wife somehow managed to break the USB port on her Samsung Galaxy S5, so we ordered this replacement, which costs dramatically less than taking her phone to a repair shop.  Our original shipment was lost but the vendor quickly sent another one, once notified.<br /><br />Installation involves removing the phone's back, using a tiny Philips head screwdriver to remove the single screw and plastic piece that retains the USB port cover, replacing the broken port with the new one, reinstalling the plastic retainer, retightening the Philips screw and replacing the phone's back.  With the proper tool in hand the entire replacement job takes only two or three minutes."
Works great other than I don't know how to set it up to turn on and off with motion. And also has a bunch of lines running through the display but doesn't effect the video.
Love this case.. Great colors and protection!! Have dropped phone twice in this case No Problem.. 😍
Very attractive looking product. It is extremely easy to use. Works perfectly as an alternative for the original Samsung battery. The charger is a no brainer; charges original Samsung battery very fast (do not expect it to do it in five minutes).
After the wite area of the case get dirty and kind change the color.  Mmmm. I try to clean it but the dirty doesn't come off.
"High quality cord, thick and durable. Recommended purchase."
Beautiful case I ordered as a gift. Beautiful color. Would definitely buy from seller again.
"We can charge all our devices at once. No more arguing over who gets to charge. Great color. Plug folds down for travel. WHen plugged into wall, doesn't block the 2nd outlet. Very pleased with purchase."
"I bought this item because I was looking for something I could use when attending events with family or friends. The set up is really quick with this item and I can't imagine anyone would have trouble using it. What surprised me the most was how sturdy this selfie stick was! I also like that it came with a GoPro compatible attachment. Overall, this is a very nice product if you are looking for a quality selfie stick for a reasonable price. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"Case fit and worked but did not notice a change in the battery life, also every time I dropped my phone the case fell apart and all of my batteries came out"
Decent holder.  Easy to use.
"I love my new case! I previously had a similar sloth astronaut case, but when I got my new phone I wanted to get a new animal. I love this. What I did not know was that this case also has a grip on the sides and unlike the sloth astronaut case I had before it is a flexible rubber to come off much easier for wireless charging :)"
Didn't go damage free for 30 days. The case chipped the first time I dropped it and every time since
"Replaced my Soundpeats with these Tacoon.  Loved my Sounpeats, they looked identical, but that is wear the comparison stops.  The voice is not English, no idea when on, off, pairing, battery low, etc.  but mainly the sound quality is often poor, crackles, disconnects, lowers volume with no prompt."
It seems to work fine so far. I haven't got way far away from a station yet to see how it works.
No complaints. I like the flat back of the case
"These are equally as good as Apple's bands and a fraction of the cost! Just wish I could get more colors. I have tried several with the metal ends and they are nothing compared to this! Yellow, red, grey, brow, navy, royal blue are just a few of my requests! Please!!!"
"Excellent product, quality color monitor including night vision at a bargain basement price.  The only downside is when mounting to the license plate, the width partially covers the existing inspection stickers.  Installation was a challenge, more so for my Toyota 4Runner then with the VW Jetta.  My first thought was to use Geek Squad but I decided to do it myself.  About 2 hours for each vehicle to get connected to power and cable run to the receiver.  The video cable wasn’t long enough for either vehicle so I purchased 15 ft cables with adaptors.  You’ll may also need additional power cable depending on where you tap the reverse sensor cable.  Great product, great price and I would highly recommend."
Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
The sound is very good however I am facing a problem with my iphone 6 plus (IOS 8.4). The sound on the other side during gsm calls is very low and sometimes the other person could not hear me well. I hope that anybody can share with a solution for this problem.
"We just got my step-kids cell phones, and needed an extra charger so they could have one at each home. These were a third of the price of the chargers at the store, and work just as well as the OEM ones. Incredible value!"
"It was a little confusing because I thought it would be the size of an iPhone 5 but it was huge because it was actually for an iPhone 6, it still works, but the description is confusing."
"I’ve been using this external battery charger for a week now and it has been working great as I’d expect from any Anker product! I’ve used it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S5 and my Acer Tablet a few times and it works as expected. This is really not a complex product, it has a micro USB input charging port so that way you can charge the battery using a USB charger of some sort. It’s a 13400mAh capacity battery so it does take several hours to charge it, just plug it in and leave it overnight and you’re good in the morning.  It has 2 full size USB ports to plug your devices into and charge, they’re standard Anker PowerIQ USB ports so you can plug anything in and charge it without having to worry about anything. It can output 2.4 amps per USB port so it can charge your phone/tablet in a hurry.  There is a little button on the front of this external battery that you can press and it lights up a circle of LED lights to indicate how much juice is left in the battery, it’s a nifty little feature so that way you know when this external battery needs to be recharged. This battery charger is about the size of a wallet, very portable and heavy for its size of course since it’s packed full of battery cells. I like the look and feel of it, it’s certainly not an eye sore. I think it will fit right in sitting right next to your phone/tablet/whatever device you have. So bottom line, this external battery charger will charge your phone multiple times and it’s very easy to use. Anker backs it up with an 18 month warranty as well so they got you covered if the unfortunate should ever happen. I attached pictures of my unit to this review as well, it’s charging my Acer Tablet and Samsung GS5 at the same time."
Purchased this for my son an he loves it use his kick stand while watching movies an clips to his hip when we're out perfect for a nine year old or adult
"Love this product but it stopped charging after a month. By the time i had a chance to return it the time had expired. The company still honored our return and sent one without us sending the broken one back yet. I love the size of this product verses different shapes. This works best with my iPhone due to them being about the same size.<br /><br />I would recommend this company to anyone and will be giving these as Christmas gifts.<br />Thanks PowerAdd,<br />Joe Beniche"
They work as you'd expect a USB cable to work. The connector on one no longer sticks in my phone but I think that's because I dropped it and it landed on the connector.
"It is great.  Easy to use.  Works.  You can just leave a battery sitting on top of it and it will charge it.  I am doing this because the charging back has arrived yet.  I am sure that will work just as well.  Too bad Samsung didn't put on in my Note 4 when they designed the thing in the first place, just another example of them falling away from what consumers want."
I replaced the boston acoustic in my camaro with these and it has been a different world.  Def way better.
"The band was OK, but way to large for my small wrist so I had to return. A description of sizing would have been helpful. If you have a small wrist, I doubt this will work for you."
Bow fell off and we had to glue it back on. Not the greatest quality.
"This is a great opening tool. The thin metal makes it easy to get into many tight spots that other opening tools can't get into. The vinyl coating that makes the handle makes the tool reasonably comfortable to use as well as providing adequate grip on the tool. The tool is flexible but still stiff enough to use effectively. I'ts thinness as well as its, shape and size makes it ideal for getting under the glass for removal. I have used this on phones, tablets and laptops for the purpose of glass replacement and it has proven extremely useful in all situations.<br /><br />This tools is metal and can damage the bezel and or the LCD. Caution is required to not scratch or damage the LCD. However, this tool is often the one that I use to get an opening started so that I can get other tools that are less likely to cause damage to the LCD between the bezel and the glass. If I'm careful I can use this tool to get around the entire glass without causing any damage from the tool."
Would not hold the phone firmly in the case. Allowed it to come out breaking the screen. Had to purchase a new phone.
"I am not one to usually write amazon reviews but I felt compelled after putting this product on...  I can say, without a doubt, this was the single easiest screen protector installation I have ever done. Wow... I was shocked how painless that was.  I have always had a love hate with screen protectors and more recently opted to stop using them for about a year. Of course, though, since getting my Note 4 a few days ago I was having new phone jitters so I caved and ordered one. I have never tried these tempered glass variants before but heard good things so for the price of this one I thought why not.  I got to say... again... Wow. The installation... flawless. Just immediately goes on and works itself onto the screen with no air bubbles or needing any sort of credit card smoothing for 20min.  Instructions on the screen protector was really easy to follow and it comes with everything you need to get it installed.  *You're Awesome Thank You card *Dust-absorber *Wet *Dry *Glass Screen Protector  ************************************************  The correct order of application is: 1. Use the WET cleaning pad on the phone screen. 2. Use the DRY wipe to completely dry the phone screen. 3. Use the Dust-absorber to remove dust which may have settled. 4. Remove the label &#34;①Step&#34; from the glass screen protector. 5. Gently press the middle of the glass screen protector, then ensure the protector has no air pockets by pressing gently but firmly against it from the center outward.    In terms of the actual feel and look of it? It feels great. I am really pleasantly surprised by this protector (granted it has only been about 10 min). It truly feels like nothing is on the screen but at the same time feels like a great layer of protection. It is clear, with no noticeable deterioration of screen quality.  Another point worth mentioning. The packaging of this brand of protector is fantastic. Comes in a hard cardboard book style inclosure. Provides 1 screen protector with a anti static wipe cloth as well as a alcohol prep tab. 10/10 for packaging. Well done Yootech. I don't think I have ever seen better packaging for a screen protector.  I may have found a rejuvenated love for screen protectors now because of tempered glass, and especially this brand. The purchase of this protector is a no brainer. You cannot beat the price for what you get."
"Within less than 3 weeks the print was fading and the card holder slots were ripping apart. It held the phone nice but as for the case itself, its a certified POS. I'm already having to order a new case. Definitely not going with this on again"
I bought one for my daughter and she loved this.  The compact design holds a lot of charges when you're on the go💥‼️
I am pretty sure that the 'screen replacement' is not glass and is plastic. Very miss leading and complete udder junk.
The only problem with this case is they send you a USB cord to charge the phone but no plug for the wall!!!! You may have to buy several till you find one with the right voltage or it will constantly beep at you. If your reading this life proof it is BS to spend over $100 and not be able to plug into the wall. Other than that the case seems to be excellent and the battery works great.
"Works as expected. I use it in my car, so I can charge multiple devices on the go."
good product.  The kit came with things (location tabs and dust sticker) that were not present in the last tempered glass cover I purchased.
"For one who's always nervous about my ability to completely remove the dust particles and push out the bubbles between any kind of glass surface protector, applying this tempered glass made me feel like a pro! The application videos are incredibly helpful, and the tempered glass comes with a clearly labeled 3 step application kit that makes everything very simple. And it looks AMAZING when complete! I'm a fan!"
Was as advertised.<br />Easy install.<br />Would recommend to others.
Counterfeit- not a real Kate Spade case. The design on the back is a sticker. The case is inferior quality and shipped directly from China.<br />Caveat Emptor!
It has no screen protection whatsoever.  I thought it may come up further around the edge to protect against dropping it but it doesn't.  All this is is a pretty case.
"Does its job, costs basically nothing. Good product."
"I had no problems with this cable.  It did what I expect it too, charged my Kindle in a timely fashion.  I do love the length. It allows me to not be so close to the wall when using why charging.  Glad for the freedom."
These have worked perfectly with the Lifeproof case I have on my iPhone 5.<br />Well made and much cheaper than paying 19.99 for just one through the original company.  Shipping was fast and packaged great.  Thank you.
The best cell phone case I've every had!  Precision fit and finish.  Great protection - front and back.
Very nice cover for my cell phone. Was as described and works great.
"Like the phone a lot.  This phone replaces the HTC evo 4 g.  The screen, and sound are superb and it is very fast.  I am suprised at how good my battery life is.  To my suprise I was impressed with how easy it was to convert my data from the evo to the desire 816."
IT DOES NOT HAVE CC SLOT OR POUCH!!! SO UR NOT GOING TO GET WHAT IS DESCRIBED FOR THE ITEM!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED
Poor material! broke at folding lines in 2 months.
The closing part is already wearing out but I do love the case
"[[VIDEOID:d900b5fc95ff333f5d63a0e92681ff04]]I brought this for navigating through roads without the need to constantly hold the phone in my hands. I have been using this for 4 days and this is a great product.<br /><br />- The materials used for manufacturing the device are good quality, solid and sturdy.<br />- Set up is very easy, attach the holder to the clamp provided and just push the suction cup on any flat surface.<br />- The suction cup is good quality and holds the device and the phone well.<br />- The device doesn't shake much when hooked in the car. The device holds the phone very well.<br />- The holder can be adjusted to any angle.<br />- The arm of the clamp also can be adjust to any angle.<br />- It can hold devices unto iPhone 6.<br /><br />Very happy with the purchase and would recommend buying this.<br />Disclaimer : I received the product for my honest review."
Lasted only 4 months and now will not charge.  Doesn't have a warrant or anything.  You would think electronic's would have a 1 year warranty.<br />I have always trusted Plantronics equipment.
Love it. Work great with my Note 5. It say fast charging on the display when you plug it in. Take about 90 min to fill it up from 5-100%.
"I've been using this case for a few months now and while I have never really dropped it enough to truly test it, I have no complaints. It's easy to slip on and off, while also adding minimal bulk to an already good sized phone (iPhone 6 plus). My only one small complaint is that the back plate feels like it isn't completely connected towards the bottom."
"Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. This product is special and different from the other iPhone 6 plus case not only because it is strong and of a very nice appearance but because has some extra value. It is very stylish and is built in Sliding Back for securely carry your Driving license, ID and Credit card. Slot will fit 2 cards and it is anti shock!"
"This case keeps my LG G3 protected from the outside.  It also covers up the t-mobile logo.  I don't use t-mobile for service and I don't need to flash their symbol around.<br /><br />The case isn't much larger than the phone itself.  It doesn't add considerable bulk, and you wouldn't really be able to tell I have a case on unless you look carefully.<br /><br />One downside to this case is it blocks some thicker ear phone plugs.  I had trouble with one set of earphones I use and had to take the case off in order to use them.<br /><br />I paired this case with a glass screen protector which I've been told does a superior job of protecting screens to the film one.

"Great stock replacement for my iPhone. I ordered this knowing that it is always good to have a back up cable, then the day after it arrived my original cable was stolen. Thank goodness I bought this. It works great!"
We tried other kind with bigger tip. We like this better (My husband and I).
I'm over whelm with joy! It's just what I needed for my iPod! Thank you very much for providing me with it!
"This  was a great fit, but the cover started peeling off."
"This is a nice temper glass screen protector. It does feel a bit cheap, but it has definitely protected my phone when it fell. It still has not cracked after all these times I have dropped my phone. Definitely a good tempered glass."
Works great.  Freed up a lot of space in the power strip since we don't need all the chargers now.
Works great on my Countertop hot water dispenser which I hadn't used for a couple of years.  Somehow I misplaced the old cord during my recent move.
"These work fine in USB 2.0 and in chargers but not in high speed USB 3.0 ports. Otherwise they are fine. They should just advertise them as not working in 3.0 and I'd rate them five. I had that issue when I first got them, contacted the seller and he sent me another batch which was nice but they have the same limitation which is no problem at all if you know about it. They will buzz and cycle on and off in USB 3.0 (the ports with blue inside and generally on the front of Dell XPS workstations) they work fine on all the others and with all the chargers I tried.<br />A major plus is they have small Apple style ends that work with Otterbox and LifeProof cases. With many cables, you have to take the case off. Imagine buying your son an expensive LifeProof case that he has to take off to use a different aftermarket cable with a stubbing end, only to have the iPhone fall into a fish tank! No, I'm not making that one up."
"I received this in the wrong size. Oddly enough I ordered two, one for a regular iPhone 6 and another for the 6 Plus. The protector received for the 6 Plus was broken and this protector was the wrong size, looking as if it might fit an iPhone 5 - big difference! I'd stay away from this vendor and order from the multitude of other vendors offering screen protectors for your tech toys."
"The second I used this screen protector, it cracks, very low quality and waste of money, try use the money to buy a better one. Luckily this time the phone did not damaged, but it is really the worst one I had ever use."
"i like the length, but the usb end tends to slip off from my car charger. also, it doesn't seem to charge my phone that fast."
"Works well.. paired up with my Android after taking off the charger and connect really fast. Charges pretty quick, phone connection is strong.  They do look ridiculous, like you have gauges in you ears. Do not try to jog or run with these.  As long as you are going to use these in your living quarters, they work great."
"I know styli can go from really cheap to really expensive quickly.  Frankly, these are cheap but they don't have the latency that I've seen in more expensive one.  For that reason and the price, I give them 5 stars.  They outperform more expensive models and if I burn through 18 of these (I bought 2 packs), I'll just buy more."
"This is more than I thought.  The convenience of the case, the look are very satisfactory and I would recommend it to all who buy the IPhone."
Screw broke off into my radio the first time I put it on and then I had to send it out for repairs. Pass on this one.
Nice case.  Thin adds little bulk to the phone.  Buttons do not have a tactile feel to differentiate them from one another.  Others have complained of difficulty inserting ear phone jacks but I have not experienced this with two different ear sets.
"Performs exactly as I would expect it to. I saw that other reviewers said that the life of the battery didn't last long and it looked like it was previously used, but mine looked brand new and performs as such."
Horrible product. Fits so loosely in the power slot that it would fall down immediately. Got stolen out of my car and I didn't really care. Would never buy again.
Disappointed. Even the thinnest cover keeps this from working properly and taking off the cover every time defeats the purpose of saving time.
"I like the minimal covers for my smart phones as I usually baby my phones and have not had too many accidents so far.  I am absolutely delighted with this cover from Otterbox and can't believe I have waited so long to get this for my iPhone 5.  I like the raised edge that protects the face of my phone.  Best of all, mine says &#34;Made in USA&#34; on the inside...can't believe the packaging didn't mention this.  None of the exterior buttons take unexpected pressure to activate the phone, volume, etc.  Very pleased with this cover and will get another when I update my smartphone choice later this fall."
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NWMI07S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
Affordable and sturdy case.  I've had no problems with screen sensitivity either.
Can't beat it best on the market so far I'm sure there's better out there but for the price it's definitely worth it the only thing I seen that goes wrong with it is the circular thing in the center that you have to press to activate
Love this speaker. Bought it to go paddle boarding and it works great. Can't believe the great sound coming from this little speaker. Very happy with my purchase. Just wish it came in more colors:-)
I will be returning both of the pairs that I ordered.  I will be listening with them and all of a sudden the volume shuts off.
nope!  doesnt work!  get a message saying this device does not always work!
This is a great item.  I use it on a daily basis and it has not let me down.  Very sticky... sticks to my phone case... and the material is great for fitting a few extra cards in there.
"This phone case is great for my 11 years old's first phone, he loves it!  It is easy to get on and off.  The only comment I would make is that the case is too think to keep on when the phone is on an iphone docking station."
"Beware if you think this is simply the micro SIM required for many GSM phones---it isn't.  The nano and adapters do not work in all phones (they get stuck).  And Cricket and the Gamestop stores that sell these have no clue about any of this.  Considering that the individual sim cards probably cost them a few cents a piece, I think it's ridiculous they don't instead include 3 sim cards, not 1 and an adapter.  They seem surprised to hear that nobody carries the individual micro sims any more, and when I finally did aquire one (off amazon no less) it would NOT connect.  They had no clue how to help me regardless of the number of rounds I went to them via phone, store, and online chat.  They finally threw their hands up in confusion.<br />They seem polite, but efficient and professional?  On that they get an 'F' !"
Love this wallet case! It's not to heavy but it's definitely secure.  You can't put too much stuff in the card holders or it will not close correctly but that's okay cause it serves it purpose for me.  My license  2 cards and a few dollars in the money slot.
This has been such a life saver! I've already bought two. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a screen protector.
It's light weight and perfect! So tired of bulky cases where the auxiliary chord didn't fit and I couldn't screen shot. This one's perfect.
"I just started using the stand. Nice design, very good cable way."
Takes forever to charge Kindles! I should have trusted the bad reviews.
"It comes with an easy applicator 'wings' that lets you align it without touching the edges - awesome.  Looks great, I don't notice any screen quality changes.  Just be 100% sure there is no tiny lint on the screen before you apply it.  It happened to me, I noticed 1 single strand of lint, so I lifted the edge of the screen protector with a knife and used a lint removing sticker they also include.<br /><br />Only problem I can think of is that it does not reach the edge of the phone, but doing so could cause it to have air bubbles around edge because the Galaxy S6's screen isn't completely flat."
"Installed sub this week which replaced my old RF Punch XLC 10&#34;  After tweaking the amp sub gain output a bit, the sound if perfect."
Slim and simple and relatively easy to keep clean. -1 star for the amount not covered at the top of the phone (only covers about 1/2 the width over the top edge of the phone).
"I was foolish enough to purchase this phone to replace my moto g,man what a mistake.The memory is awful ,but the quality of the phone itself is the worst.I have had this phone for just 8 months never dropped it or had it get wet and out of thin air I now have lines running across the screen.It started with 1 line right after I used the camera,after that every few days a new line would appear.Now I have about 20 lines running across the top half of the screen and thats after more just popped up while writing this review.I contacted Posh support when the 1st line popped up and they were quick to claim physical damage and suggested I send them the phone for them to analyze to determine if it was damaged meaning I would have to pay to send it back to China probably. No way was I going to do that,so I just let them know how defective their products are and that I will never buy another Posh anything again.It comes with a ton of bloatware it has no notification light even for charging,the USB is at the top of the phone.You can't even turn camera shutter sound off ,the battery life is terrible (a phone from 1995 probably got better battery life).the processor is junk Facebook stalls a lot especially if another app is running.The WiFi is awful,I step on my front porch and lose signal.My moto g I could walk 2 full blocks before I lost my WiFi signal from my home router.The sound quality is the worst of any phone on the planet,the front camera is garbage too.To anyone out there that thought about any posh phone do yourself a favor and just scroll to another brand .Please by all means spend not 1 dime on their phones.AVOID POSH PHONES AT ALL COST!Don't even buy it for a child."
"The charging pad was easy to install with only a slight bulge in the back of the phone.  It still fit into my Ringke case.  It does take a little time to find the best position on the charging pad, but one found works great.<br />The only problem I had was months after I installed it.  The screen on my phone came unglued at one edge.  I cannot say for sure it was from the constant pressure of the extra thickness of the charging pad.  It only cost $15 to have it reglued at the galaxy store and there was no apparent harm done to the phone.  To be safe I am not going to replace it and have ordered a complete charging back cover."
fits great easy to grip. best of all finally a case that covers the stupid apple on back of phone.<br />hate having a window there.
"This is a fantastic product! I purchased it to use while on a 2,500 mile road trip and it performed flawlessly. Sticks to my textured dash without any problems and provides quick and easy access to my iPhone 6."
"Very good quality!  comes with everything, very happy with them, sound great and exactly the same to the ones that they gave me with my Samsung galaxy s5(: would definitely recommend!!"
"So I bought theses covers right after I bought my Note 5, which these say they are for. No matter how you try to put these on, it does not cover the whole screen. For 6 bucks, I really wasn't gonna complain, but if they claim to do something they don't, then why advertise that. Other than that the cover is okay. It would have definitely been a 4 or 5 star, but because the whole screen isn't covered, I deduced some. Granted it is only a super small sliver of screen left..."
Stylus was great but there was NO INK in the pens :-(
"When the product works it is great. However, it has been a pain to try and figure out why the speaker won't work. Only have had the item 4 days. Worked 1 of those days so far."
Great durable phone case especially for a klutz like me. Only issue is that it increases the phone size by a quarter inch on all sides and doubles the weight of the phone
Very thin case. The decals on the inside of the case were pealing when I received it. Pictures come out blurry! Did not like it all!
"Terrible design. These earbuds will not stay in my ears. Tried walking with them but they fell out every couple of steps I took. I looked like a psycho walking down the street holding them in my ears so I never used them on a walk again. They only work for me if I'm sitting perfectly still and remove all the oil from my skin as the rubber covers get extremely slippery if you have the slightest bit of oil on your skin. I gave two stars because the sound quality isn't terrible, but for me these headphones are useless."
Screen protector was easy to apply and is cut perfectly for this hard to fit screen. Once applied it's virtually unnoticeable (except for the cutouts for the cameras / mic which are absolutely necessary). Buying another right now.
Great case!  A bit of challenge getting the screen cover on without any specs of dust being trapped on it.
"This kit does not come with the saddle clamps so if your speakers do not have the clamps to connect the speaker to the mount, then you will need to contact customer service at bazooka to get the clamps.  Otherwise, this is a high-quality product at a great price."
"Did not work with Iphone 6; apparently unlike Android phones, Iphone 6 does not support Qi technology.  For it to work I found out it needs an external plug hooked to the Iphone in order to receive the Qi wave."
Phone doesn't have a flash plus the memory on the phone gets full fast to the point where you can't download anymore apps
Works well he cord is sturdy. Lasted longer than Apple product but still split at the end after a long period of use.
Let me start out by saying that I drive a tractor trailer and deliver freight for a living.I've had other Nite Ize cases in the past and loved them but this is the biggest case so far.It lasted a year in a half before becoming unusable but then it was a big case that was constantly being subjected to rubbing the trailer walls as I was trying to get pallets off a trailer so I really can't say anything bad about it.By the way I still have a small Nite Ize case that's still going strong after 5 years.
Fits perfectly and I love that I could find a clear one so I can see the color of my Ipod.
Pretty sweet. The only thing is that I have a nokia Lumia 635. It doesn't work with my phone. If someone else found out please tell me thank you!
"When I bought this phone I loved it at first but it wasn't long before I changed my mind.  One thing all the other customers haven't informed you about that's a big negative is the fact that it isn't a very durable phone, not that all phones are in the first place, but this one particular wasn't.  I bought a protective rubberized case for mine with a glass protector as well.  When I went to pick my phone up off the desk I fumbled it a couple times in the process and dropped it.  The height was no more than a couple of inches but it was enough to kill the speaker in the back so that I started getting a static like sound out of it when it played and then cut out on me entirely."
"Beautiful Case. I ordered the incorrect size. Display shows like it will fit a iPhone 6 plus the new phone, but it doesn't."
"The armband is soft and comfortable when worn. The Galaxy Note 5 fits even with the case I have on my phone. The screen is responsive with the plastic cover. I would not recomend using the key holder if the key does not completely slip into the slot, otherwise the key may fall out during your walk or run. Also the openings for the bottom of the phone are not place correctly. The headphone  jack is covered. You can probably put a head set if you stretch the material where the hole is at. If you only use bluetooth headphones then this should not be an issue. Overall, it does the job of holding my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 while I run."
The case is perfect I got it for myself but my daughter has the same phone so she claimed it for herself
Great 'add on' find!  I bought it as a back-up in case my more expensive version of the same style broke and I've been using it trouble free for a while now so it's also a great value.
best BASS for your BUCK.<br /><br />amazing for short work outs where you need that music flowing through your veins for that extra push. BUT if you do longer workouts (2+ hours) the back end of the earbuds (the hard part) tends to irritates the part of the ear that secures the earbud itself from moving.
"Looks nice and fit perfect.  Everything is as expected.  This may not protect iPhone especially when it's dropped, however, I know it before I purchased this item, so not complaining.  The color turned from clear to darker shade after a few months of use, but with darker shade, it still looks good to me."
"All you would expect from a top-of-the-line Android phone. I chose the Galaxy 5 over the 6 because I wanted to use my SD card, and I wanted to replace the battery when it gets low of charge. Metro pcs offers a real unlimited data/talk plan (no throttled speed) for $60/mo. I upgraded from the Galaxy S3, and my only complaint is the high price."
This is a great product.  Easy to install and no bubbles.  Crystal clear.
"THIS IS A SUPER GREAT CHARGER SO FAR! I LOVE THE 3 USB PORTS, THE MOST I'VE EVER HAD IS 2! ALMOST EVERYTHING CAN BE CHARGING STUFF IN THE CAR INSTEAD OF FIGHTING OVER TURNS! EVEN THE ADULTS! IT SEEMS TO CHARGE FAST WHICH IS A SUPER PLUS!<br /><br />*DISCLAIMER: I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN RETURN FOR MY HONEST REVIEW AFTER USING IT,"
This product DOES NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy 5 as indicated! I didn't even use the case for 2 seconds and it's already damaged my phone!<br /><br />CHARGING AREA; Samsung has a water resistant cover for their charging port. The Empire MPERO IMPACT opening is not long enough to allow the samsung charging port cover to open which has caused mine to snap off and break!<br />OUTER BUTTONS; The volume and power buttons do not align properly from case to phone so none of your functions will work.<br />TOO BIG; The entire case is just too big in areas and too small in others...terrible design!
not the same quailty of what i wanted but this is a moment of you get what you pay for. its not very good for bass just regular toned muisc enough to get by for awhile but deff need to buy a better pair.
This is not a tempered glass screen protector. Seller should stop passing it off as tempered glass it's a cheap plastic at best I'll be sending this back. Buy else where.
Very suitable replacement for the original Samsung battery. Went from pulling barely 1 and 1/2 hours of screen on time back to upwards of 3 and 1/2 to 4 and 1/2 hours screen on time depending on usage.
"Cute,  convenient, inexpensive,  protective ....  BUT doesn't last long.  Had the case  for about 4 weeks when it started looking really worn out and cracking where is bends when you open it. Then after 8 weeks the seems completely ripped through where the wallet part is so it won't hold money or cards. I never overstuffed it or anything.  I'll probably order another because the price is right but as far as quality it definitely doesn't compare to the otterbox wallet case"
"Works really well. Love the length, can never go back to the short! I've tried so many non-Apple cords but this one is the best value for money!"
The phone is very basic as you would expect but the built in TV tuner is useless. It's a Analog TV. You'll be lucky if you could even find one watchable channels.
"Works well.  Fast shipping.  Some static experienced, but that is a result of driving in the city."
Excellent quality case.  Exactly what I was looking for...a clear case to protect entire phone from scratches but without adding to the size of the phone.  Just make sure you put the case on perfect because any areas that do not completely adhere to the phone will cause problems once dirt gets under it.  Would definitely buy again!
"Great seller but the quality of this ACEPower Cord leaves much to be desired. Have had it for 2 1/2 months and it finally stopped charging. Have been using it on my iPad since mid June. It worked well at the start although it was a bit difficult to fit into the charging area. It was almost as if the pin connector was a little too wide. After a couple weeks it started to fit easier but then the rubber coating over the wires broke where it meets the pin connector. Since July, it intermittently would not charge when plugged in. It finally gave out today. I've tried running Hard Resets, using other Power Adapters, and 30 Pin to USB cords and have found this ACEPower Cord to be at fault. My electronics are always well taken care of too. The only good feature is the length...it's 10 feet long. You may want to avoid the hastle and cost of purchasing this inferior product only to have to spend more on a better quality Apple product. I learned my lesson."
"Great case.  The only thing I wish it had had was something silicone to get a better grip of the surface, and a slightly raised front face so when you lay the phone down the screen down't touch the surface of whatever it is on.  Other than that, great case.  Very cute."
"As soon as I put it on, my phone feels protected while looking stylish. The buttons are a little hard to press but you'll get used to it. Loved that this was only 9$. And yes people it does protect the protruding camera. I feel my phone is better protected now because of this case and I have a tempered glass screen on it. Awesome :). I got mine in blue"
The screen protector is really thin and flimsy. Thought it would have been more than just a piece of plastic protecting the screen. But overall good case.
LOVE this speaker! The battery lasts forever and its actually pretty loud. It's very light weight and easy to store away when you are finished with it. I definitely recommend this speaker to other buyers!
Can't beat the price for such a high-quality product.
Perfect for taking on trips cause u don't need a wallet.<br />There's room for cash and a credit card..it's a.nice sturdy case. .
"Bought one of these and this model for my husband because I already had one and liked its performance, for the most part.  Wish it had caller ID feature but can't have it all.  He likes it just fine; uses it mainly for driving.  Mine is attached to my ear it seems sometimes.  Thank you for a good product and a good price point."
"Great case!  Fits my phone perfectly, protects the screen, looks and feels like expensive leather...I love it!  This is the second Juicy Case I've purchased, previously owned one for my LG G3.  I love that you can see who's calling, answer calls take photos, and more without opening the case. The stand feature works perfectly both horizontally and vertically when you I need to work hands-free.  There are lots more great features, but in summary, it's the perfect case for me.  I highly recommend!"
Have only had it for 2 months and the strap has broken off and the colors have dulled considerably. Did not last long at all!!!
After getting one of the brand's other product and decided to get another because of the good experience. This is a good product that give it a good boast. I use it every time I am on vacation or hiking. Give it a shoot.
Very impressed with product.  Super easy to attach to my LG G4 and so much brighter than the plastic protectors I've used before.<br /><br />Great experience
Pros: The case was easy to install and fits my iPhone 6 great and I love the color. The screen proctor goes on with fairly easy with just a little effort to get all the air bubbles out. Cons: the back of the case is very slick and easily slides out of your hand especially when using the phone one handed. The port to access the silence mode on and off switch on the side of the case is quite deep and somewhat difficult to reach and operate especially if you do not have long finger nails. I have not dropped the phone in the case to test its durability but over all it's a decent case for the price range it is in.
"The battery works fine, but I am still disappointed with the seller.  I accidentally ordered two of these batteries and the seller would not take back the extra and refund my payment. Now, by the time the first battery wears out the second will probably not be viable anyway."
These products work for a bit then stop working. The seller is also not responsive to feedback. Do not buy!!!
"Broke after 2 weeks of general use. Otherwise, this was the best case I ever used. I love the grip on the back, and it was very sleek. Even came with a free screen protector. I wish it didn't break tho :-("
"The sound is great for such a small speaker. It attaches easily and it doesn't get in the way. The controls could be a little more tactile (I have to stop and look at it to adjust the volume) but that's a minor complaint, all things considered."
Works good the only issue I have is the mute button on the headphones it does not match up with my Cisco soft phone on my PC. When I am on mute on the Cisco soft phone and unmute it from the Cisco softphone the mute stays on the headphones.Other than that they are very clear.
I tried this product out and immediately returned it.  The sound was very distorted. The headphones play an on off audio message when the user turns them on or off.  The play back of the audio message was also very distorted.
"I've had this charger for about 8 months now, and I am here to tell you, it is fantastic! It works well on my Nexus 6 with a dual layer case. Just set it down, and click, it's charging away!<br /><br />The only thing that been slightly odd over these months, is that sometimes when I take the phone off of the charger, the blue light will stay lit. I have mine connected to a power strip that has a switch, so I just do a quick off & back on with it, and the blue charging light stays off."
This fell apart after about 2 month of use. It says lifetime warranty but I have not been able to return this item.
Didnt came with the pink case offered. 1 week of use and the screen go bad damaged with strips.
"works fine, good price. no problems."
Wow!  FAST charging time.  Seems like a high quality product.
"I've had this Bluetooth transmitter for a couple of months now and has yet to fail. I use it everyday, and always works flawless. A great addition to your car if you have an older model vehicle that doesn't have AUX or Bluetooth. It comes with a 2.5 V USB adapter which enables you to charge tablets/iPads. I use this transmitter with an iPhone and have no compatibility issues, it even charges my iPhone to 100% charge in less than an hour."
The case was great for charging my phone. But when I dropped my phone - the screen cracked. Now I use an otter box and carry a charger with me.
So so very happy with this screen protector! It was the second brand I ordered because the first one I got was terrible and was promptly sent back.  This protector was the easiest one I have ever applied and it looks great! Thank you!
"I just had to replace my Motorola Bluetooth after several years of use, and got the same model because I like it so much.  It is easy to use and has great clarity."
"This case was a very tight fit for my phone which in return messed up my display, the people at Sprint said for me to take it off because it was also causing it to over heat."
"Worst case ever! I was using my selfie stick with the case on. I thought it wouldn't break so I was like whatever. So when it fell of my selfie stick and I saw it cracked, I was in tears!!"
"Great lightweight but protective case!  I usually don't like cases, since they seem to make the phone feel too bulky, but after I dropped (and broke) my old Moto X (with no case), I thought it would be a good time to buy a case.  This works well while staying out of the way. Thanks!"
The jetpack works great. I was disappointed with usb cord.  It was a cheap cord; got hot when used to charge so I got a better one.
"Thank , I really liked , shipping was fast ."
I just started using my solar charger on my bike rides. It hold the charge throughout my ride.  Throughout my ride  I also use map my ride and play pandora.  38 miles today.
Works very well and seems very protective but I don't like how slick the hard part of the cases in my hand
"I bought this last month. Used it one time, SHORTLY! I plug it into my iphone today and it doesn't even work! Very disappointed and it cannot be returned or even exchanged for a new one, because the return window just ended (of course it did). What a waste of money!"
Very cute snap on case with all the great lines from Fault In Our Stars. No image smudging or off center placements. Really cute case and I always get compliments
I'm returning it for a refund because it wouldn'the fit the tablet. I made sure I put in all the information on the Samsung Galaxy tablet 8&#34; and it didn't come close to fitting it on the width. I was very disappointed because this was for my grandson's birthday present.
"what i expected, keeps scratches away but wont really be protected if it falls although its not a snap on so the cover stays on. great fit."
perfect!  I've used this for about 2 months now and still grips like a champ!
I admit it. I'm a phone dropper. I probably drop my phone at least 3 times a day and this case has yet to let damage happen to my phone. So if this case is able to stand the test of my tendecies then I guess it most be a pretty awesome case.
"The first thing I noticed about this charger is that it has a very solid feel to it. Being waterproof, it only has a couple seals to cover up the ports which means less parts that could potentially break."
Stickers are the perfect size and have not peeled off like one would expect. Are extremely responsive and ive even accidentally spilled juice on a sticker that i have on a nightstand and it still functions.
Awesome case! Just wish it gave u the option to buy without the built in screen so I can put an HD screen on it instead of the crappy plastic it comes with. I dropped it over 20x's already & my phone is still in perfect condition!!
Gets the job done but the rubber parts ware and eventually become detached if you're not careful.  Fully water proof though!
"Wow! What a difference this battery case makes! Took it out of the package today and put it on my IPhone6. Ended up being in class for 8 hours (and we all know what you do in class). Came out of class and had a full charge! Will be great for trips, sporting events, and times when I can't plug in. It does make the phone a little heavier (obviously) but not so much that it would affect my decision to buy.  * I received a discount as a product reviewer but this has not affected the authenticity of my review."
The case came in very quickly and is even cuter n person but it fits so snug that have not been able to remove it.
"I am always dropping my phone. The other day I dropped it from a 3 story stair case. When I got to my phone, it was laying face down. I picked it up and it was just fine. A few scratches but other than that it was fine!!"
A surprisingly good case at an excellent value price.
That last star could be had if only there was an opening that allowed the light sensor to adjust the brightness automatically. It's the only flaw I see. The elastic band is wide and fits my arm well. I have 19&#34; biceps and I don't have to adjust it open very much. On the smallest setting it fits around a medium sized water bottle and doesn't fall off. (For my arm exercises that make an arm band impractical). Overall it's a winner.
"Awesome Case! Fits Well And I Love It, 5 Stars!"
Product works great with my phone.  I'm a little disappointed with the stand capability. I have to lean it against something to keep it in the correct position.
"I absolutely love these. I have really weird shaped ear canals apparently as essentially no ear bud will stay in my ears. These, however, do. And they're comfortable. Which is a definite first for me. I wear them while working out and never have to worry about adjusting them. Sound is awesome as well. And I LOVE the fact they're Bluetooth. No more forgetting your earphones are plugged into your phone and dancing around your kitchen and watching your precious piece of technology fall to the floor (not that I've ever DONE that...;) lol) even better, I can leave my phone plugged in in the living room and still listen to music while cooking. The ONLY thing I could possibly gripe about, and that's rather petty, I have a small head so the band on the back doesn't fit snug to my head. but once on I normally don't even notice it."
This product works just great with my Apple Watch. I'm really happy about how well the watch attached to the Spigen and how reliable it has been. The only question I have is whether the stick-on base for the Spigen is reusable so I could bring along the stand when I travel
helps keep me on track with daily walking. had to go online to figure out how to work it though
Great case for our families purposes.  Not the &#34;tank model&#34; case protector but for the price this is a must get!
This was an excellent amp and still works now. It provides some really good base and even better we bought this at an excellent price. I wish they were still available I would definitely buy another for my other car.
Great TPU case fits perfectly.  The back is a little bit more slick than the all clear TPU cases but it won't show the scratches like the all clear TPU cases do.  Very similar to Belkin's Grip Candy but on this one the sides have little bumps making it easier to hold.
"Super bright ends, works good. The ends are way too bright and the cord lights you can barely see. For the price they are awesome!"
I bought this almost a year ago and my phone hasn't been scratched at all. Which is pretty impressive because I drop it all the time. It's coming apart now but it lasted a while! Would recommend.
Sturdy case.  My husband loves it.
"I broke the ear hook on my Motorola Whisper, this fits great, locking into place on the earpiece.  Will order a new one when this one eventually wears out."
"This charger absolutely does NOT fit the Galaxy S4 battery. I bought it without reading the reviews, and regret the lost $5.99."
"A good case, but if you put 5 or more bills in the bill pocket it gets hard to close."
"Overall, I really like the band and seeing my steps thru the day is a great way to focus more on my fitness.  I am not sure that the sleep measurement is accurate.  Also, I hit the band on things sometimes due to being a little tall."
These are high quality. Remember that on all newer cars with factory alarms/keys that have transmitters within the key. You will need a bypass module. Evo All is my choice for high quality. Made in Canada. Take your time to install neatly and you will be very happy.
I love these ear buds. The sound quality is amazing. They are easy to switch from music to phone and fit my ear canals nicely. I will definitely use them for many years to come. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Great product.  Works well with my lifeproof 6 case.
Excellent case love it!
"Very great buy!!!! Its definitely something worth investing in,plus an extra battery. Now my phone rarely ever dies (unless I leave my extra battery at home...lol). I travel out of town a lot,so whenever I do, I put one of the batteries on this to charge over night, then charge my phone,& simply grab it on my way out the door & place it in my pocket so I'll have it with me whenever I need it throughout the day. And it stays fully charged all day without me having to put it back on the charger."
"I purchased one of these recently in anticipation of a Europe trip.  I didn't plan especially well and the unit showed up just two days before we left.  Unfortunately it wasn't manufactured properly and the connector receptacles didn't align properly with the case so that I couldn't get the charge connector in.  I knew that I didn't have time to return it and get a new one prior to my trip so I did some manual rework of the unit with a screwdriver so that the connector fit (but just barely).  I had heard good things about Anker but this unit was definitely made poorly and I was left with a barely functional unit that has disappointed me.  Update - After the review above where I originally gave the product 2 stars, I was contacted by Anker customer service and offered a replacement unit.  I took them up on the offer and it arrived a few days later.  I am still disappointed by the need to get a replacement but very impressed that they dealt with the issue so quickly and with so little extra work on my part.  Thanks Anker."
"Good casing i like it. good quality and it fits my iphone 6. the casing is good quality and I am glad i got this product. I really like it. I really recommend the product and it is money worth it. Good condition, good packaging. I Got this with a good price discount during promotional product in exchange of unbiased and honest reiews."
Bluetooth does not always connect automatically when I get in the car and I have to tinker with it for awhile to get it too work.
"Works great! Didn't end up keeping it because I found it pointless, but it's a cool product for the right people."
Can't keep the corners down on the product. But this is most likely something I did wrong on installation
Replaced following instructions on line.  Wireless very carefully.  However glass cracked one week after replaced.  Suspect glass was damaged by not to the eye.
Purchased for my wife and she love's it!!!
NOT VERY QUICK RESPONDING. BATTERY LIFE IS BAD AND CALLS SOUND BAD HAD TO RETURN THE PHONE.
One of the best peices of insurance my iPhone could have. I am a rough and tough biker and my phone is my lifeline. I have worn out my first otter box.  This is my second and surely not my last. I recommend this product over any of the other manufacturers available.  Be sure ur ordering a true otter box and not a knock off.
"This band works as described. It fits well and is easy to put on. It's best if you use the safety bands that can be purchased separately in case you get your watch band caught on something, then it won't go flying off."
"Works as advertised.  Convenient, light weight and accurate. Wish I could save music to the watch, but I knew that wasn't a feature at purchase.  Ideal for a beginning runner."
I use this piece with the mountek magnet it does the job pretty well but I wish they can provide an extra sided tape with it
Worst phone ive ever bought.straight out of the box the headphone jack never worked. after a few months of owning it the cheap battery's life span is less than half as good as it was out of the box. I ordered the wrong version with our knowing so it always has connectivity issues on tmobiles prepaid network and always drops calls and texts never gets through. Now when i barely touch the screen the picture on the screen warps and discolors out of nowhere!!!! If your looking for a cheap phone thats really good try the asus zenphone and avoid this terrible unsupportivte company at all costs.
"Took this to the beach last week hoping to get some nice shots of our daughters first time in the ocean. I have the 6 and my wife has the 6 Plus. Usually I will NOT take phones to the beach because sand can do a number on your phone. Thanks to Levin I had both my 6 and 6 Plus protected from the sand and even the water. I took my phone into the water and my wife wanted some underwater shots of her and my daughters feet in the sand. I dunked the Levin down underwater and was able to snap some great photos using the volume rocker button which this case gives you access to.<br /><br />All the pictures came out clear which was wonderful. One thing I did notice however was when you pulled the phone out of the water there was some slight condensation around the camera lens area, this may have been due to the fact that the water was in the high 70s but the outside heat index was 105*. This quickly disappeared and caused no issues for the phones. I appreciate the built in area for a wrist strap as well. It makes me feel a little more secure when using this around water incase it slipped from my hands.<br /><br />The screen itself is also covered with some plastic layer, It was a little difficult to type on at first but we were able to get the hang of it quickly.<br /><br />Charging the device was a bit of an issue, we had some after market cables with us who's connector heads were thicker then OEM cables. They couldn't fit inside the cut out so the phone had to be removed from the case. Upon returning home I tested charging with OEM cable and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />Overall I had a very positive experience with this. I can't knock the whole charging issue because Levin isn't going to make it to spec for every cable company.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes"
"Inexpensive, nice unit for daily driver."
Instructions where wrong. Had to look up how to do it myself. Only worked for a week and now the remote won't even turn on. I've tried new batteries and making sure the connections weren't obstructed. Nothing works. Had to disarm my truck manually. Do not buy! Worse buy ever
"nice product for a quick charge when no access to electricity.  Beach, long bike rides, etc. Don't be left without cell phone power !!"
"On time, work perfectly out of the box, friends say sounds great."
A really nice looking cable that works great. I got if for my daughter. She loves the color blue. She used it for her Samsung s5. The cable has a nice feeling and a nice bright blue color. It looks like it will last a very long time.<br /><br />The USB cable is reinforce specially where cables tend to break easy. So that's a plus. It also works with the computer it syncs from computer to cellphone without any problem. Very well made it is durable and I know it will be in used for a very long time.<br /><br />I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.
"This is a very good minimalist case. Be sure you are ready for minimalist, though, because it is very thin and light. It has a good fit, and you get a good grip with it. As long as you go in with the right expectations, this case is a winner. And the purple color is fun, too. I've owned several elago brand cases and have not been disappointed with any of them."
"It kept my phone screen from breaking, but this glass broke very easily"
"I've recently have built my own custom computer and I have a preferred keyboard that only connects via bluetooth and I didn't have an adapter installed within the software, and I've come across this little jewel. The procedure is simple really. If you have a Windows 7 or 8 you're going to need to download the driver before you can even utilize this device. If you have a Windows 10, the driver that comes along with it will bug out a bit, so you'd have to install the SB340 Driver from either their website or from the CD they've kindly included in the packaging. 1) Plug in SoundBot SB340 in your USB port. 2) Install the driver 3) utilize the GUI within your task bar 4) follow the instructions on pairing the device 5) you're done!  This little jewel is just simple. Effective. and Great! Not only does it just connect 1 device, but it also connects up to how many you want.  This is a great buy and I would recommend to anyone who is looking to buy a Bluetooth adapter."
The product description  intimated that the closure was secured by velcro.  I bought this product because I didn't want a magnet to close and secure the ipod case.  As it turns out the case is secured by a magnet.  Bummer
These are so chic and love the gold accents in all the right places. They are sleek and James Bondish. I would have given 5 stars but I'm unable to use in my car to hook up with USB plug in and won't work with Bose speaker UNLESS you take off case... Total bummer but I still love the case. But all they need to do is make the hole bigger and voila !! It's perfection!!
"The generic wireless charging plate does the job, the only thing is that you should center your phone in order it charges property, but for the price you can't go wrong, and the delivery was really fast."
"Easy install, and thin enough to fit with a case. I did the proper pre-installation cleaning procedures and it looked great, but there were smears on the glass almost immediately. I keep my hands fairly clean and never had problems with residue on screens, but this protector seems to be constantly smeared, and it's tough to remove."
"As many others have posted, this does not seat correctly on the edges of a Nexus 6.  It looked terrible but I kept it on for 6 weeks because I didn't have the opportunity to order an alternative. I finally took it off when dirt was building up around the edges because it was lifted off the screen."
"Nice case it's great for the price I had a 30 dollar case from a phone store and it broke a few weeks later,I have had this case for a month an it still looks new and none of the stones came off yet"
Very high quality product! So easy to install and gives crystal clear view! I applied it while husband was driving so it's that easy with no bubbles to apply awesome packaging highly recommend
"***First off, I would like to preface this review by stating that I received it for free upon agreement that I would provide honest feedback on the item.<br /><br />The charger arrived one day after ordering...so once again, I was super impressed with Amazon's wonderful shipping. The charger itself is self-explanatory to use [plugged it into the cigarette lighter adapter] and it is a lot smaller than others I have come across which makes it convenient to use and/or store in the glove box (or middle seat compartment). It recognized and connected to my iphone as soon as I plugged it in and as far as I can tell, it works quickly. Since I haven't used it much I only gave it 4 stars, as I cannot say anything of the longevity of the charger or the charge it provides, but my initial impressions were very good [I plan on updating this over time :)]. The only minor thing that might be a nuisance is just that while the metal portion of the charger provides a sleek and sturdy look, hot weather makes this area really hot too and it's right where you would grasp it......but again, an almost inconsequential aside to a very well made product."
"I have an iPhone 5c and I specifically ordered it for my shape of phone and when it arrived, it was built for an iPhone 6. It sucked. The case was nice, though"
"If you're looking for rugged, dependable case for the Note 5, then this case is a perfect choice! I chose the case in the pink and black. It comes in two parts: the rubberized interior and a thick, plastic portion that snaps over to hold it in place. The case was easy to install and is a great fit for the phone. It also included a kickstand, which is handy if I'm watching movies or videos on my phone. This case feels like very solid protection.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"I am very disappointed in this product.  Prior to installing this on my wife's Note 4, I installed one of their tempered glass protectors on my LG G4 and was quite pleased.  The one for my G4 covered my phone screen completely, with just a very small hazy bubble on the bottom section that is barely noticeable.  With this in mind, I thought that the one for my wife's Note 4 would have a similar fit and finish.  As you can see from the pictures, this was not the case at all.  First, it only covers the active screen portion, and leaves a 1-2 mm gap all the way around.  In addition to this, there is an air gap about the same 1-2 mm from the edge of the screen protector from where the glass just doesn't sit down all the way.  I'll be looking for other glass screen protectors in the future."
"I have installed many screen protectors and this one was unlike others. The halo effect around the edges is a total shame. I'd like a replacement or something. This isn't just a consumer made issue, it's happening to almost everyone"
"I've been buying everything Fallout that I can find. This little thing is cool and looks kinda wasteland style too. It seems to work just fine and is well made. The sturdy little wooden box attached to the cord with the Fallout logo on has a nice classy look. Also the item arrived at my house in California, from Latvia, in 8 days. Not working days, 8 days total. Excellent."
It's not a original samsung if it was it would fit perfectly but it does not.I didn't have problems with the conectors.I had problems putting the phone back together.the bezel frame didn't go back together the way it should and not only that the the framework that the Screen and digitizer is attached is different.I had to modify it in some areas to get the speaker to fasten down due to a little nub that is sticking up that was not on my original.That is not all the dam thing gets real hot too.I can't send my back because I modified mine to Fit.
"I liked and recommend to other customers b/c is nice-looking. I'd used for 1 month, it met my expectations."
Perfect...fast delivery! Just as described... And exactly what I needed!
"Love it!  Made for display and not for protection.  But, I knew that going in.  Was worried it would be the 'ND' instead of the Fighting Sioux logo, but it is exactly as pictured for the Galaxy Note 4.  Well definitely have it going during hockey season!"
"Shopping experience: excellent, products arrived quickly, at expected times.<br /><br />Product: Plantronics M60 is good, works fine, and is perfectly adequate for non-noisy environments.  Sound quality is not as good as 5 other corded ear sets I've tried in noisy environments (e.g., in my car).  For example, Jabra EarWave Corded is superior.  However, note that all corded ear sets I've tried (including Plantronics M60) give superior sound quality to any of the 5-6 Bluetooth (non-corded) ear sets I've tried."
"Worked as advertised on an AT&T iPhone 5 (16GB). Is a detailed repair, not for a novice. iFixit guide worked great and unit has been used for about two weeks with no issues."
Exactly as pictured.  Fits like a glove.
Gets too hot when charging & I Pad & I Phone at the same time & I asume that is what it is designed for
Does not have bumper put the fake glass over your screen and put this case on and your Iphone 6 will be classy a.f
Perfect size for carrying in your pocket.Couldn't be happier with this purchase.I got these on a protmotional offer so I could provide my honest feedback on these
"I received this unit two days ago. Received it as scheduled. I went ahead and installed the unit. Installation was real quick, as everything is explained in the operation manual.<br />I did all tastes as required. Tuner was okay, playing music via cd was awesome, as well as playing music via USB.<br />I have a Sony xperia z2, so configuring my phone to this head unit via NFC was wonderful. I did make a series of phone calls, and everything went on smoothly.<br />Men, I was very happy. I love Sony."
"Took about 2 hours to install, but the effort was worth it.  I would had spent twice as much at the mall for a generic screen.  I got the original screen and fixed it at half the price."
"For the price, it was alright and I loved the design on the back!  It also fit my phone well.  However, there were clips/flaws in the outer edges of the case that were disappointing. For example, there were areas where the purple/grey color was missing, the edges were rough, and there was a large blemish (rough area) on the front face plate of the case."
"Piece of junk, picture quality sucks, when wiring just connect red power and video and audio, do not connect black gound"
"Solid item, just as good as in the pictures online. Case has endured 2 falls no problems or scratches"
"I left my phone in my sweats and washed my iPhone 5 with this case on it. My iPhone went through all 4-cycles and after 2-years, it still works. I looked on Amazon to see if I could order this part of the case again. Now you have to buy the entire case."
Works like advertised.  Convenient with the cup holder thing.  It was a liitle small for the cup holders in a Chevy van but one of those foam can insulators made it fit like a charm.
"Great quality. Glad I didn't spend $150 for actual Apple product. And no, my wrist is not turning green, haters."
"Charges everything so fast it's like magic.  Only one issue, the 12v connector needs a slightly longer connector at the very front.  It looses connection and really has to be jammed in.  I have a Toyota Camery, so it's not like some exotic strange car...  If that front connector stuck out about two more millimeters, it would be a 5-star, no questions..."
"I'm enjoying the simplicity of not having to plug my phone in to charge it. I wish the directions on hooking up induction device into my Samsung S4 would have been more detailed. I'm a technician and it stumped me for.a while, but, I was able to figure it out. I'm sure some person without my experience would not have been so fortunate.<br />I'm not complaining."
Completely waste of money if you want a case to protect you phone. I dropped it two times and the case opened in both .Second time I wasn't lucky and the display crashed.
Ok  phone I buy for someone
Just as ordered. Perfect!
"I wanted to like these, but literally half of the pens didn't work at all- like the pen tip wouldn't even come down"
"Color was nearly same as on my computer screen, but I am okay with it. And it's already saved my phone twice. May just need to get another one in a different color."
I love this phone great screen and sound quality you can install all the apps you could possibly want with 32gb onboard storage i only wish you could update to lollipop i got this phone to replace my lg g3 that was stolen from me and i must say i am not disappointed.
"Lens opening on case does not line up at all with the lens on my iPad. Case is cute, but I have to return it."
"Bought this for music in my car.  For the price, I couldn't be more satisified.  My phone connects automatically every time I get in the car and the audio sounds pretty good (for an aftermarket bluetooth adapter).<br /><br />4/5 because the phone feature on this is terrible - I had to stop making calls on it immediately because people complained they could not hear me.<br /><br />If you're buying it for music, I highly recommend."
"I tried the OEM quick circle case for the LG G4- way too slippery in my hand.  I kept feeling like I was going to drop it.  This one has a texture that makes it feel more secure in your hand and much easier to grab.  The case is shaped correctly for the phone and closed very securely every time yet opens easily.  It''s holding up well, looks great, fits perfectly, and at $15 is a much better value than the $50 OEM case for the G4.  I just wish they made it in more colors.  I'd buy another.  I only wish the quick circle cases had a plastic cover instead of an open window but that's the style and it works."
"My first smart phone, and I absolutely love it. Real Android (5.1.1 as of last update), great screen, good call quality (all cellphones aren't that good), excellent connectivity on WiFi and 4G. Works GREAT with Cricket Wireless. I get 4G LTE in strong signal areas, HSPA in my home which has a fair to poor signal. Calls always go through just fine, even in my low signal home.<br /><br />I selected Cricket Wireless as my carrier, and bought the BYOP kit from Amazon. Works great, but read the caution below. Solution is to make sure you buy a MicroSIM kit for BYOP.<br /><br />The only caution is that the box has an icon showing Micro SIM OK, nanoSIM Bad!. Googling this, I found that the electrical contacts for the SIM slot can catch on NonoSIM to MicroSIM adapters if the SIM card is removed. This is the case for me, since I chose Cricket Wireless (ATT Prepaid) as my carrier. Since I don't intend to remove the SIM, it isn't a big problem. Knowing about the problem, should I need to remove the SIM (to change carriers, for example), I will need to take care extracting the Cricket NanoSIM. You can google the method, which is not complicated, and is essentially slipping a very thin piece of plastic (like screen protector plastic) into the SIM slot before gently removing the NanoSIM"
"This case cracked on the side of the camera after only a few weeks of use. My wife never removed it from her phone, and doesn't know how it happened. The only thing I can think is it happened from putting it in her pocket."
"I picked this phone for my teen who likes Google. His school uses it so he is familiar with their apps. We have other phones in the house, iPhone & fire phone. The phone comes with screen saver and a gel like case, without the case the phone feels like fabric on the back. The case is very thin and bendable. The headphones are ok. The screen is bright and easy to read from. The icons are very vivid, kid like and colored like jolly ranchers. My initial reaction was lukewarm,  I am a fan of other brands. But once I spent some time with it and got use to its different menu system and apps it actually is pretty nice for its price range. Camera works well and has a quick shutter. Power button is on the side next to volume, sometimes turn it off by accident. I do like the large screen. The teen likes it, and it's cheap enough to replace if lost or damaged.<br />Update: the FM radio feature allows you to record what your hearing and has a speaker function, although not room filling sound allows you to use the radio feature without your headphones on your ears. The headphones are the antenna. Battery seems to drain quickly, depending on how much you use and have screen on, this may become an issue."
"Exact fit , especially like the built - in screen protector. Only one I found that had a protected charging port , keeps the  dirt out .."
"The magnet on this case is so weak that when I dropped the phone, the case whipped open on the way down and the phone landed on the sidewalk glass-down and smashed.  Plus it was never that great to start with, it looked worn after just a few uses.  Please do not buy this case if you are relying on it to protect your phone."
"I never do reviews  &#34; never &#34; but I just dropped my phone in Starbucks parking lot came out and noticed my phone on ground , tire marks on case!!! I am using my phone to write review !!! Don't no how it made it honestly but it did"
These cables work well but I find that sometimes I have to flip the connector over and plug it back into the iPad or it will tell me that it is not charging and sometimes they can be a bit finicky and you need to keep plugging them in for it to say it is &#34;charging&#34;.  But heh for the price I can live with it.
"I purchased the same case for full price and it started breaking soon after, this is the same case and the price was spectacular"
"Update 05/06/17: Piece of junk. Skips recording. Almost every time I need video of an incident it is missing. It will have video before or video after, but not what I need. DO NOT waste your money on this camera.<br />Update 10/27/15: Have started having problems with KDLINKS X1. The camera reboots continuously for about three minutes every time I cut my vehicle off. I have been in touch with the seller and was told it is probably a battery issue. They asked me to charge the unit with a phone charger for several hours, which I am currently doing, and see if that fixes the problem.<br /><br />After doing my research on dash cams I purchased the KDLinks X1 Full- HD camera along with a (Panorama S 2015 edition updated Sony Exmor IMX322 Sensor CMOS DashCam PowerUCC Panorama 2S / S International Model) and installed both in my truck side by side. Both cameras had the best reviews for the cost on several forums. Both cameras have performed well. Even though both manufactures recommend taking the camera out of the vehicle on hot days, I have not. I have left both on my windshield all summer in a black truck with the windows up and plenty of 100 degree plus days without a problem. The picture quality on both cameras is excellent both day and night. The KDLinks ships with a GPS module and software that will display your speed and location on google maps when played back and it was $20 cheaper than the Panorama. The KDLinks cord was also much longer. The Panorama S can handle larger storage cards. The reason for four stars instead of five is the mount. The suction cup is built well and holds good but the swivel/disconnect that goes between the camera and suction cup is very weak. So flimsy that they include an extra one with the adhesive mount. If they fix this they will have a perfect setup. The mount on the Panorama is rock solid but it cost $20 more and does not come standard with GPS."
"Have used this product for about two months now as my daily charger at work. Quality has been good, no experiences of not charging or being warned by iOS that the device is unsupported. Would (and probably will) buy this product again."
"Horrible headphones.  No matter which size ear piece I use, they constantly fall out of my ears when exercising.  There is an audible &#34;clicking&#34; noise from one of the earbuds when I run, like one of the mechanisms is loose in there, and it is difficult to establish the bluetooth connection.  I also find that having the control buttons on the ear piece is a total pain in the a$$, as you have to constantly touch your ear to make song and volume selections.  Makes me feel like I'm practicing for the Secret Service.  Hate these headphones and I am going to send them back ASAP.  I guess all the great reviews came from people who got these sent to them for free, like a lot of electronics vendors do on Amazon.  Cheap."
nice cable
"These speakers are tremendous sounding in my Chevy sonic. Built an enclosure just slightly bigger than what they spec out at and... Wow. They hit harder than the 12&#34; subs that I had before. The amp is good. Probably a bit to powerful for these subs but it can be turned down. This amp gets hot! It needs to be in a well ventated area and probably should have some sort of fan on it. Otherwise, awesome"
Fits the Samsung 4S edge perfectly.  Hold the phone really tight.  My daughter doesn't like to carry a bag and this cover has enough space for her cards and cash.  The colors are very classy.
"I bought this case for my husband's phone because he needs to carry his phone to work in a safe place, and this case does a very good job, it has a little stand in case you want to put the phone in the table and watch videos, the case is very resistant and He already dropped his phone several times and the phone is intact as the case too! Nice product!!!"
"Waste of time and money, if it does do what the description says you need plenty if patience to figure it out and I believe this item had a previous owner because there was a picture in the album of what look like the inside of a prison!  I have returned this item which is a better success then the overall item!"
"Perfect fit.  Easy to install, but be sure to use plenty of the spray when you install it. GPS is mounted on bicycle and has seen thousands of miles in all kinds of weather and screen protector still looks new."
Works great with cleaning but leaves a nobody micro lint particles behind.
No seriously waste of money don't buy this! phone i got this phone it sucks! its slow and the camera is blury and wow! the keyboard is off! dont buy this okay just dont buy this its enough android s***ty! phone
"[[VIDEOID:62e5762bb8e193596a116b24f7622a79]] We are always skeptical when we review these types of headphones, but we were impressed with this set for the comfort and sound quality.  as we show in the video, the packaging comes with the headphones, a micro USB cable to charge them and a few sized ear pieces.  Definitely try the different sizes and find the best one for you.  This will make a different in comfort, staying in the ear, sound quality and background noise blocking.<br /><br />The diagram left a little to be desired on locating the charging port and we had a good laugh finding it.  I show in the video exactly where it is and how to get to it.  We knew it was there but did not feel the little catch at first.  Charging did not take long and we get hours of streaming play from it.  Using it for calls decreased the battery life some.<br /><br />The audible and tiny LED light let you know the status of the headphones at any time.  It tells you when it powers on and off to make things easier.  Pairing was quite simple as well.<br /><br />So the bad thing.  The microphone is located in the tiny control bar and we tend tower that part behind our ears so while we could hear them well the other side didn't always get a crystal clear sound from us. There was some background noise.  It tried to pick only my voice up but there was some definite background and the location makes that tough for the headphones to do.  See the video for what we mean and a demo.<br /><br />Comfort for long periods of time was not a problem and we enjoyed the sound quality.  These are not supposed to be music perfection in sound, but the snug fit while we ran was just as important as having decent sound quality.  There headphones did both.<br /><br />See the video for unpacking, setup and more."
I hate it because it didn't come with a plug in cord.  So  now I have to buy a separate cord.  I should NOT  have bought this item because of that.
It doesn't work for my phone...and that sucks a waste of money and waiting on it to come in the mail..
Do not buy this piece of garbage.  The item does not look anything like what you get. I am returning this item ASAP.  Don't bother with this product
I should of did this a long time ago. The audio quality is really good if your iffy. The only thing is when you turn your car off and on you gotta turn the adapter back on and when it turns on and connects it's a bit choppy for a few secs but after that it's crystal clear.
Had my case for a few weeks now... so far soooo good. Only bad thing is the flip part gets in the way of the camera. But I would still recommend this product.
"I was debating either this case or the spegin case and I went with this one due to more variety of colors. Side buttons work great. It does increase the size of the phone, but what case doesnt. I love it!"
Works as advertised.
Absolutely amazing! i love this product went to Universal and Disney and was able to charge my Iphone 5 both times completely charged with out me charging the device it's self. The product was charged when i recived so it was good to go! Would most definitely recommend to all my friends really great and perfect size to carry in your purse!
"Perfect fit.  Quality seems good.  Carabiner is probably more useful, for me, than the belt loop.  I prefer the belt clips.  But overall a good product for the money."
I just opened it & from first glance it's alright. Not the best quality case but for the price it is exactly what I expected. Crossing my fingers that it will last as while. It does have a strong odor. Hoping that goes away after a while of use.
"For a fair review, I received a discount on my order and I'm happy to say this case is fantastic. Protects my phone and doesn't make it bulky at all. Very happy customer!"
I bought this to use with my iPhone 6 plus in my brand new Honda Accord coupe v6. Well it worked. I like the way it holds  my phone. I will get another one for my wife's car. Very sturdy.
"[[VIDEOID:e15d0a2de938a390e1af79e9fd82c9ad]]I am absolutely in love with this Collen Samsung Galaxy s6 case.  The pictures really don't do this case justice.  This case is made of poly carbonate and plastic and is fused together to make it shock absorbent.  The aluminum sheeting on the back really stands out though, it really has a polished metal look and is very unique.  It was incredibly easy to install yet at the same time you can tell it will keep my Samsung phone safe my breaking.  It also comes with a tempered glass screen.  I will be purchasing all my phone cases from Collen from now on.  The quality is top notch and the price is even better!  I did receive this product as a promotion so that I may provide my honest unbiased review."
"I love the LOOK of the case and fits very well. Unfortunately, just as I thought, it has been a month and rhinestones are falling out. The middle is made of the tacky glue with stones on it (very good) but the edge is a strip of rhinestone which the strip is falling off and rhinestones have fallen out. Was pretty for a month, but just ordered a better case."
"I got this to back up power for the i-phone.I am normally around a power source, but if I decide to tear out on the bike,drop it in my pocket and go! I have only had to charge my phone three time/per one battery charge,but am sure I could go more. The led light is a bonus feature that helps also.Really bright.With charge level indicator, this is all you need for back up power for most devices."
works great on Windows 10.
"I do not like this item. The elephant is discolored, and this case does not protect my phone at all. Why is this one plastic and the case for the 4s is rubber? I liked this case for the 4s a lot more, and I don't know why they changed it."
"This is exactly what I ordered, and it is nice, but I don't know how secure my cell phone will be if I accidentally drop it."
"all good. but it needs our command to check us, not automatic. and there is no function to measure heart rate periodically or continuously. its the very disappointing. we cant extract raw value of GSR, only 'connected' or 'disconnected'. also no multi-pairing, poor app market (android). if you focus on heart rate only, mio alpha will be best choice."
Works. What else can you say?
"used the Plantronics BackBeat Headphones for three months before the right ear bud stopped delivering sound.  amazon has a one-month return policy, so I'm stuck with half a headset.  nice color, however."
Fast shipping. Easy install. Works perfectly fine.
I love being able to have a spare battery on hard.  Lighter than carrying around a portable charger and cable.
I love the protection this case gives. I've dropped my phone several times while using this case and it has protected it from any damage. It goes on easy and I love the way it feels in my hand. It does add a little bulk to the phone but I actually like that it feels bigger. I've gotten many compliments on how great it looks. I would definitely recommend this case.
I bought these during the Prime Sale and like them. The colors & texture of these cords help make them easy to find.
"Says its compatible with finger print scanner but it's isn't. Does not work, not pleased with this product."
"I give it only a 3 star because it didn't fit well into the lighter. But, for my daughter's car out fit awesome; in which, in her case it's a 6 star. The product is well made. Great invention. I just wished the insertion portion was longer."
I bought this a couple weeks ago and so far so good. Came on time and works like a charm. And much cheaper than other cables. Double win. I'd give it five stars but I haven't had them long enough to say if they last
Very cute and I've used it for a long time. It protects the screen and is easy to open and close and I like that I can throw an ID & debit card in it when I don't want to carry my purse.
Great product. Fit as expected. Better than some of the more expensive so called tactical pants as far as practicality.
Love this case. I kept breaking my commander plastic clip so after the 4th clip I got this one. So glad I found it. I love how it keeps it nice and secure and has a magnet clip keeps it shut. The material is nice and thick. I have had a stray string come loose but nothing major.
"Pros: Has a flashlight. Nice display. Good camera.<br />Cons: Slow, no memory, has a tendency to crash (all the time). Strange version of ANdroid. Packed with proprietary bloatware.<br /><br />Overall not the ultimate smartphone experience. Spend another $30-$50 and get a phone that will actually perform. Not this wannabe smartphone."
"I love this product. It is so much better than the &#34;film,&#34; products."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I tried a different, $12, vent gripper model that claimed it was big enough for Nexus 6, but it broke in the first 7 minutes of use with my nexus in its case (not a very thick case, but that may have been the critical factor). I was worried this one wouldn't stick to my curved dash (haven't tried it on a textured area yet) but it holds TIGHT! Took it on a road trip and it did a great job. I live in a high heat area (100 F is normal right now) and it has had NO slippage/falling off of the dash. Great product for a great price. Def a go-to item for any Nexus 6 owners."
"Not the happiest with this item. If you have your phone in it and not in a plastic bag dirt, dust, lint, and anything else that might be in your pocket or anywhere for that matter gets inside and ruins your screen. I will say if it was improved on it could be a great product ! $20 bucks you def get what you paid for"
Couldn't get it to charge. Need refund info
Very good.  It strongly attacks to the surface you nedd and offers a perfect grip for your gps or any other device.
"I've had the Quick 2.0 charger for about a week now and have been very pleased with it.  I've charged my iPad Air, my HTC One(M8), my wife's iPhone 6+, an LG G Pad, and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.  They all charged very quickly without any issues.  The micro USB cable that comes with it may be a little short for some people, but it was perfect for me.  I had to supply my own lightning cable for the Apple products."
"No major complaints. OK for the money, just a little spongy but works well enough."
"[[VIDEOID:8943003c9d2daf0b517bd419f9f13144]]This is a fantastic multi cable , this is a must for everyone .This is the ultimate charging cable , for multiple devices .<br />This offers you a:<br />- micro USB<br />- Lightning compatible<br />- Apple 30 pin<br />- 8 Pin compatible<br />- kindle<br />This works amazing with all our different devices , it doesn't give any error messages .The ends fit nice and tight for a secure charge .<br />I love this because I don't have to have a bunch of cables , you can have everything neat and tidy with just this one awesome cable .<br />This is so versatile and useful , saving money on lost cables and time looking for cables .<br />I love everything about this amazing cable and I can guarantee you will love it as much as I do.<br /><br />I highly recommend this awesome multi cable ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
It took almost 2 months but I got it tested it out before installing the phone and no leaks perfect also the kick stand is very flimsy but it's awesome
"This case is awesome! Very easy to put on the phone, and I feel that it is much better then the last case! Love it!"
excelent<br />20mts dive no problem
little bit of a a pain to get the cord in but so cute love it.
It lasted quite a few drops... finally the case died :( all the fastners broke off.  does get dirty.
Their colors are really nice and they fit the iPhone.<br />I have been using them for a year now and they still look great.<br />I recommend them to anybody :)
"First of all I saw a lot of stars given to this product so I decided to buy 3 of it 2 black and one transparent This were great at the beginning specially with the black one as its really cover the device very will and protect it. The gripping is very great as well. After two weeks from using the first pice I start noticing that the right side has become a bit loser and then a week after that right side start to come out same as the pictures are shown. I though I miss used it at the beginning but then the rest of the other sides start to come out. I decided to use the second one but again same problem all the sides start to come out. It seems that the glow which been implemented is not that strong. Now I am using the transparent one, It has some advantages and disadvantages compare to the black. Advantage is that it's thinner Disadvantage I doubt that it can resist drops same as the black Also it has the same struckter as the black. I wish I can get a feedback from the I-blason I like their products but it doesn't make any sense to be to buy multiple item from the same product"
"Great Case, I've dropped my phone more times then I can count and this case saves it every time, Very Sturdy and strong case, holds fine except if you start running be aware whenever you do a little run to your car while it's raining etc cause it might slip out of place"
"I've  owned Otterbox Defenders for all my family's phones but that have an Achilles heal in the fact the rubber material they use for the outer sleeve stretches after about 5 months of use and need's to be replaced. That in itself is unacceptable but now reduced their warranty because this problem was getting g to expensive  for them. My first one for my Note 4 us about 5 months old and I just had to file a warranty claim for a new outer slip cover. Experience has taught me I will be doing so in about another 5 months and after that (pardon me there is no easier way to put this) I'm screwed. Google the problem and you find thousands of owners all with the same stretching problem and apparently Otterbox doesn't care and this case carry a $69.00 MSRP that's  not chicken feed. Guess I'll  have to look at a Life Proof. More expensive for sure but wit the Otterbox Defender outer rubber slipcover only lasting 5 months before the corners stretch you'd only be entitled to two replacements before the warrant expires which translates into buying a new case from Otterbox every year, I don't think so."
Great quality Ipad Air 2 connector cord for use with the Phantom 3. Perfect length.
"Have had Tone Infinim bluetooth for less than 2 months and on/off switch already does not work. Had a short in it, now does not work at all. Hope the 1 year gaurantee is worth something, because its not to Amazon."
Didn't buy these on amazon but at one of those rip off cell phone stores.  My disappointment with this product is that it leaves big areas around the ear/lens section and button section exposed and uncovered.  The box picture doesn't depict this.
"Took a little patience to get the screen off, but this $15 investment was so much easier than spending over $100! !!!! Took about 15 minutes tops"
"The hinge started to crack and come apart quickly, and the rubber part that holds the ipad was slightly warped. Very cute hello kitty design though."
I'm not a big fan of this case. When I make calls no one can hear me. I have to always have my headphones in and it's just annoying that I don't even use the case anymore.
These are great for the budget price. I use them all the time for runs and they have been great!
I really liked the case. Before ordering I was thinking the quality would not be good but when I received I felt really good that I ordered as it is good quality wise as well. Now I'm thinking to order headphones but again lil doubtful lets see
"I ordered one to try about a week ago and loved it. Not only is it constructed very well but those clips top and bottom are definitely not going anywhere when you clip them. It is very flexible and there is no stopping it when it comes to the position of viewing. The possibilities are endless. Hehe. Great viewing experience with either, my iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. No more achy hands and arms holding up cellphone for 2 hours. I clip anywhere and watch. My favorite is clipping it to edge of futon and voila, I just lay back comfortable and enjoy a good movie. I fell in love with this product that I went ahead and ordered a few days ago 2 more for my son and a friend. I highly recommend this product and for the price, you simply cannot beat it."
The wall adapter part of the charger works fine.  The wire however broke within a few days. I had to pull part of the cable out of the phone.
"Edit: 21-DEC-15 They thanked me for changing the review to four stars and then retracted the offer to the free stainless version. This time I'll be keeping the one star rating until I receive a product that does not rust. It was advertised as water sports. Kevin and Marty, No need to email me again and waste my time.   Edit: 20-DEC-15 I am editing my review to receive the new stainless version. This one should not rust. Hopefully.  Original: Used once on a one day boat trip. Rinsed with all my other gear and towel dried/ air dried. This is the only thing that rusted. Contacted their customer support and didn't hear anything back."
"I love this case!!!  Being a fan of Tokyo Ghoul, I was hoping that I would somehow find a case for my phone that is from this anime.  I was extremely excited at finding this one.  It has all the characters, the art is fantastic, and it compliments my phone greatly.  I alternate between this one and my wolf wallet case for my phone, depending on my mood, but I absolutely love this!!!  The material is quite sturdy, it arrived in perfect condition, and it hasn't gotten damaged on me so far."
Arrived in two days.  Good quality charger
Sound is ok. Not worth the price. Bluetooth disconnects constantly. Very unhappy with product.
Sound quality is very poor compared to the 730. If you like listening to load music that sound great. Then get the 730. If you just like using them for talking then buy the 750.
nice size soft touch works puts most pens don't either don't come out or don't write.<br />you get what you paid for
I love it ! It is a pretty nice case comes with all little functions such as opening /closing with magnet attached and pockets to hold your business cards or credit cards . Also It has a small window so your iPhone logo could display from the back...
"HANDS DOWN, BEST CELLPHONE CASE I HAVE EVER BOOT. Thanks!"
Suuuch a great case!!! I loved it. Will definately buy more in different colors. Great buy
"Works great, the kids love rocking out in my car. This way I can pass my phone around for them to pick songs instead of it being tethered by aux cable.<br /><br />Start car, press button, start music, it's that easy."
Great phone! Everything is so smooth and the camera exceeded my expectation. Also cool that you can get a Gear VR and turn this phone into an amazing VR  kit.
This was for my 17 yr old daughter who has issues with dropping things etc. So far This phone has stood the test. As far as mechanics and features she seems pleased with it.
Difficult to charge with USB - you either have to remove the case to ensure the USB stays plugged​ in or just make sure you don't bump or move the phone and even then sometimes the cable comes off. Otherwise it served the purpose I bought it for.
[[VIDEOID:5dc7ce00bc2f2b2a013997093480213]]I have been looking for high quality clear case for my phone because I have a limited blue samsung galaxy s6 and I really want to keep my phone safe but also see it's attractive color.  This phone case is anti scratch and anti dust.  The cover really is impact resistant and made of a flexible plastic that was really easy to install and yet durable at the same time.  I wish this one came with a glass screen cover but for the price of this case I cannot complain.  I'm 100 % satisfied.  I did receive this case as a promotion so that I may leave my honest unbiased review.
"I don't get 11 hours of talk time but this fits well, is easy to use and very clear reception."
"So far so good, great product for the price though it does feel cheap but that doesn't matter because it delivers great sound!"
"It has fewer features than previous high end Garmin had. It is annoying that you cannot add custom POI icons, and simply have a few generic icons to choose from. On the plus side though, I can now easily find the local brothels during my travels..."
"For the price you can not really bet it, but you get what you pay for. It is kind of tricky to get the watch on it to start charging."
"This is my second Microsoft Lumia phone. The XL is so much easier to read and I love the Dual Sim. This way I don't need another cell phone when travelling to Germany. The only drawback I see is that the android phones have so many more apps available. I miss playing Scrabble on the Microsoft phone, a great way to pass the time at airports or in doctor's offices. I do like the fact that the Microsoft phone was much more affordable than the Android phones I was considering. All in all I am happy with my purchase."
"This is a very solid, durable case. My husband is a nurse and keeps his phone with him at all times and he loves this case. Only complaint is lack of color options for men (who dont want neon)."
I wrote a review before saying it was great purchase but it was too early. The screen keeps going black all the time. Bad purchase don't not buy.
"Why would i give them five stars?.First, their sound quality is very good. Secondly, they have noise cancelling system which is working perfect. Thirdly, their battery life is as described to their descriptions. I workouts everyday at evening and it supports me better. It's sweat proof. Little wire is so smooth. I feel comfortable to use this headphones. Fourth, bluetooth is working fine from far distance. Fifth, price is reasonable, any one can buy with this range. So, all over i can say that this bluetooth headphones is one of the best headphones ever."
Very Good charge love it.<br />I will buy from this company again<br /><br />Thank you Q vigo Trading Company.<br />Keep up the Good Work.
"I just tried to connect, and the connector that is inside the cover lifted off and was loose inside it. Im from Panamá and the only think that they can do is a replacement or a refund only if I send back the product, it will cost me more to return it. What a shame I was thinking this will be a good product"
Love this mount. If there is any con at all it would be a pain to remove but 99% of people would manage just fine.
When I got the case I was happy. But after a couple days I noticed  the exterior layer was peeling off. Would not buy from them !
This is a great product. I was searching all the possibilities to unlock my wife phone and after a video on YouTube this did the trick and al the hundreds of pictures were recover from her broken phone.
It was easy to put on and take off and has already saved the phone more than once
Nice case.....textured on back...stays in your pocket
"The pins that extend from the band that slides in the watch (the pins that create the loop for the band) are very cheap and within a few minutes of having the watch on they came out. Seems to be of cheaper quality. The packaging was nice and it arrived quickly and the rose gold had good color to it, although it didn't pair as well with the Sport watch silver metal as I had hoped it would. The supplied adjustment tool to remove the pins was cheap but it got the job done and is a must have for DIY adjustments of the band. In summary, I just didn't feel comfortable having this band keep a $400 watch on my wrist."
"This is an amazing little receiver. Heist Mode allows 5 devices to all be connected simultaneously (but not playing) so that you don't have to keep pairing, connecting, disconnecting, and unpairing. Every other Bluetooth device I've ever owned has had issues with connections so that it needed to be routinely unpaired and repaired so that it would recognize that yes, it was supposed to be connected and doing something. The Moto Stream has no such problems. The use of microUSB for the power connector was also a great choice because it makes it easy to find a way to power it without needing to carry a separate barrel plug charger."
"This is a neat little case for the Galaxy Note 4.<br /><br />The one I received is a matte black with a red kickstand component on the back.<br /><br />I am always excited about new tech products to try out, especially for my Note 4, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. When it arrived, I immediately put it onto my phone.<br /><br />It snaps right onto the back on the phone, and all buttons or entry points for headphones and charges are easily accessible through the cutouts.<br /><br />The kickstand on the back can be easily manipulated so as to be able to put it in the exact position that you want it, with 5 different position points. The first, obviously being all the way closed, then 3 additional points. The last peg (or 4th) requires that the tab be completely looped against the back of your phone. If this sounds confusing, there will be photos to demonstrate.<br /><br />It does hold my phone up pretty well when being compared to other kickstand cases on the market.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't particularly like or appreciate about this case is that it provides little to no protection for your phone at all. There is no support other than the thin plastic backing itself. Also, when the kickstand is in use, the back of the phone is exposed through the kickstand track.<br /><br />What I love about this case is being able to charge my device without a USB cable, and even being able to sync it. The kickstand component has the feature to do this by plugging the end right into any charging port or USB port and plug the micro charging end into your phone.<br /><br />That being said, if you are careful with your phone, I think this would be a great accessory for your Note 4, but if you drop it a lot, you may be needing a new one with this case.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. This is my honest and personal experience with this case."
"Love this case!!  I didn't know the leg of the cup also served as a stand,  I glued it because it seemed weak and my phone is heavy and I did not want it to break. But it is such a cute case! For a great price. 👍"
"Cheap and functional, exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use, and keeps my phone safe."
Doesn't work well. Comes off easily and bubbles after using.
This works  wonderfully  as a charger. The downside  is  that  it  gets stuck in the car and is very difficult  to  remove . I almost pulled the whole dash  out.
"decent for the price.  I wouldn't say this is going to prevent a break if dropped from waist level on concrete, but its about what I expected.  I wanted something thin and with a bit of elasticity and this fit the bill."
"love it!!  Fits my LG G4 perfect, lightweight, glitter is really cute got many compliments. Keeps my phone safe."
"I liked the concept of this phone case/wallet, but the magnate was not very strong on the closure piece and so it would fall open frequently."
"This is a good case for the price.  I needed something fast to protect my phone.  Since there weren't many options for the leather back LG G4, I grabbed this until I found something nicer.  It has held up nicely.  Also it has a stand that snaps into place and holds tight."
Finally a product that looks and functions exactly as it looks in the picture! It was right on time. Couldn't be happier!
I was really disappointed by the volume capability of this speaker. It's not very loud at all. I returned this product.
"These offer me a sense of protection with my Fitbit -- I don't worry that it will fall off unexpectedly.  Additionally, the bright colors are a nice spark of happiness for my otherwise dull black Fitbit."
"I bought two of these since the price was right.  I figured that at least one of them would die fairly quickly, and that would leave me with one good one to depend on.  They have both been flawless to date, and I have had no trouble with them whatsoever,  The size and shape make them easy to pack and store while your not using them, but still gives a good feel in the hand while you are plugging things in.  The only possible drawback is that with it's enormous storage capacity, it takes a while to fully charge, but I can only curse physics for that."
Got delivered quickly.  I used for about two weeks now and had no problems.  Perfect length with the RC and my iPad or phone. I recommend this product.
It looks exactly like the Picture! I wouldn't recommend this case if you're wanting a lot of protection. It is very pretty and I do like it a lot!
Definitely strong enough to protect my phone. Looks great with gold. Plenty of padding for back lens. Kick stand rocks
"Compared to other reviews I felt like maybe I am missing something? The case seems to be cheaply made. The slots for the cards is very thin, and as I'm sliding cards in/out, I am finding that my cards are getting stuck. As I'm removing my cards the very thin, non-leather nylon /poly part (grey in pic) is super thin, and very loose. I'm not sure if it's because it is not glued down all the way.<br />The actual phone part, is hard to place your phone in, or remove your phone from.<br />The quality feels soft, but does not feel or smell like real leather. I do not recommend this product if your looking for something of decent quality. I received this product at a promotional price, in exchange for my honest review."
arrived right on time.  so pretty fits great!
its the right size and i love the color
"I tested this product out by charging my LG G3.  I was was fast, not surprisingly so but, good.  It is compact, lightweight and perfect for travel.  I love that my husband and I will be able to charge out phones at the same time if needed.  I like that I do not need my phone charger and can use the USB that comes with this one.  A big plus is that it has a surge protector inside to sustain reliable power.  I do not see any negatives to this product.<br />Sample provided"
"This is the best cell phone case I have ever bought, I have dropped my phone 100's of times and it's perfectly safe."
Not great quality. Don't  like the way you have to hook it up.
Bought for added protection for my phone. Was a little put off by seeing the lines where the cover ended. Dropped my phone a few times and it did protect the screen but had cracks that were sharp to the touch.
Excellent all-around product with great pricing and shipping time frame actions.
"Got them as a gift and they're great! Perfect for physical activity, they stay in your ears, and just throwing in your bag quickly because they don't tangle."
Very nice protective case for I phone 6 plus. I dropped my phone 2 times and no damage. Easy to put on looks nice and not bulky. I like!!!
"I found the case I wanted at the price I was willing to pay. Then came choosing the design, which in itself was kinda fun. When I saw the design I chose, it was immediately recognizable as the correct choice for me. When I saw the name of it, &#34;Owl&#34;, that was instantly recognizable as incorrect. I is a CAT. When I opened it, it was apparent it is no ordinary cat, but the CHESHIRE CAT. I love it and have gotten more &#34;Where'd you get that? It's so cool!&#34; comments about it than anything else I own."
"This battery charger actually BROKE my better, original battery. After putting the original battery in this charger, the battery stopped working completely. I wanted to get a refund, but I wasn't able to since the original battery was destroyed and I had no other batteries on which to rely, and the return window was extremely short. Terrible made in China knock off product.  Update: The charger itself broke just over 3 months after I received it."
"Great product.  Has a little trouble switching between phones, but purchased two"
it took forever to get them. would not have ordered them if i knew they were from China. While waiting I bought 3 other ones with the mesh tip. i love these ! Will use the other ones as back-up ! At a $1.52 for ten it was a bargain. Too exspensive to send back all the way to China !
Only had them for a day but I'm impressed. Way better sound (especially low frequencies) and fit than my old Motorola SD-10s. Battery life seems good at several hours. Haven't tested mic and Siri yet. This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones that I've owned that actually have any bass. For the price you will not be disappointed.
"I love this phone!  Does everything, and more, that I wanted in a phone.  I had the LG 306G, which in of itself is a great simple phone, but this Alcatel OneTouch rivals any phone out there.  It's perfect!"
the Bluetooth shuts off alot and you have to reset it with a toothpick that kind a sucks
"I really like this product it feels really smooth, the touch works perfect, easy installation and its really good quality so your iPhone screen will be protected."
"* I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. *<br /><br />I've had several different versions of backup chargers, but unfortunately I often forget to recharge them after use, so without a power source (which of course would illiminate the need for the backup in the first place) they become temporarily useless. I love the idea of this solar powered power bank. I camp a lot and I think this would be perfect for keeping my phone charged in case of emergency. I also like the idea of keeping it in my car. In order to charge the unit for the first time, I actually left they unit on my dashboard for an afternoon while I was driving around doing errands. At about 75% full according to the LED lights, I hooked up my phone (a Samsung Galaxy s5) and it charged easily and pretty quick. I did check a couple of notifications while it was charging the phone, but it still gave me about 20% additional charge. Not ideal testing circumstances, but still plenty to buy me some time with, or I imagine in an emergency, it would allow for at least a phone call or a few. Of course, I also like the environmental aspect of having a solar charger, I hope that the technology continues to improve so more products like this become more widely available. The carabiner that came with it for attaching to a bag or for hanging is a great idea, but I found the one included was too small to fit or hang well on the actual unit. It also doesn't feel very strong, so I'd be afraid it might bend or break. I plan to add my own larger one so that I can keep this clipped or otherwise easily accessible. Great idea, and an easy to use alternative option to standard back up chargers."
"After suffering the vagaries of cheap aftermarket cables, I decided to go with the Honeywell brand (having used their industrial products).  This thing died in less than 6 weeks. Figuring out how to contact these people to demand a replacement.  Disappointed."
"Lightweight, sturdy, and easy to hold. Perfect for general protection."
"only good if your phone won't charge like mine, honestly I just got this because my old galaxy s3 was my dedicated music player"
"For what it is, it's great. Moved kid from a flip phone to this and he is happy. Works as expected."
Came just as I expected.  It fit my phone unlike the last phone case I ordered it did not fit and is still sitting in the envelope it came in
yet too receive but i seen the same one at best buy for an amazingly higher price soo i do know the quality its five stars
Everything about this works and looks great. The sound quality is ok but for the price what can you ask for. I left my phone in another room and the bluetooth still worked. Much better than I expected.
"They came just the way they look in the pictures! I was so excited to get them and the way the stylus' were, just made the expererience even more exciting."
"Would work great if I didn't have a case that doesn't allow the phone to sit all the way down in the cradle to make enough contact to charge and such.  As such, I had to send it back as I want the case more than the dock."
"I think this power adapter works well, but I only had it a couple months before my Google Nexus 7 stopped taking a charge.  However, the problem is with my device and not really with this adapter.  It's solid, it's one piece, and it does what it says it's supposed to."
"You get what you pay. It charges my Nexus 5 way too slow, one cable broke after less than one week, and some of these cables can't transfer data. I bought other more expensive cables and the other cables worked as expected, but these ones are just bad. Invest in better quality cables rather than quantity, hope this tip helps anybody."
Video Review<br /><br />https://youtu.be/czpJMiKOveE
"I am very sad abut this, but I am extremely dissatisfied about this Up24 from Jawbone.<br />After having worked perfectly during almost a year, Two weeks ago the band just stopped working and it would take any charge anymore.<br /><br />I was expecting this to work for at least a couple of years."
"works perfect, give me 4g full bars in areas where i normally have no signal. I have owned 4 of the 3g versions and will stick with Wilson."
"This is a pretty good drive cam. Below are my thoughts.<br /><br />*** POSITIVE ***<br /><br />* Includes a good SanDisk 32GB card. At the settings I used (1920x1080/1080FHD) , It takes about 188MB for 2 minutes or 94MB per minute, so 32GB gives about 5.5 hours of record time which is pretty good in my opinion.<br />* The suction cup is strong when mounted properly.<br />* The size of the camera is good, but there are even smaller ones.<br />* Audio quality is pretty good... better than another drive cam I have.<br />* The wide 150 degree field of view seems just right for a drive cam.<br />* Video quality during the day and night is good... video is smooth. I had no problems sticking the micro SDHC card into an SD adapter then into an SD card reader and then playing the recording video with Windows Media Player.<br />* The camera can be set to automatically come on when power is supplied and start recording (with a delay of 0, 10, 20, or 30 seconds), and then to turn off automatically when power is lost. The built-in battery allows you to keep recording after power loss for 0, 10, 20, or 30 seconds (it's one of the options).<br />* Once setup properly it should work without any maintenance (the way it should be) as it keeps a rolling video record.<br />* Nicely packaged and boxed.<br />* Comes with a one year &#34;hassle - free&#34; warranty that can be extended by 6 months if you register your product.<br /><br />*** NEGATIVE ***<br /><br />* Perhaps I got a defective power cord, but I had some serious issues getting a stable power connection plugging the power cord into a car power outlet. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume something was wrong with my power cord so I won't deduct much for this.<br />* The camera caught reflections on the windshield... it would be better if this camera had a polarized lens or filter to reduce the reflections... or positioning the lens closer to the windshield would probably help too.<br />* While playing around and reviewing some photos, it crashed and locked-up (but this is the only time I experienced a lock-up).<br /><br />*** OTHER ***<br /><br />* It's hard to read license plates unless the car is right in front of you but this is typical for cameras of this resolution<br />* Don't forget to remove the protective film over the lens<br />* I thought about uploading some video from the drive cam but Amazon wouldn't show it in a resolution that does it justice. You may want to search YouTube for videos that preserve the image quality that this drive cam is capable of.<br />* The camera is somewhat easy to remove from the mount. My other drive cam is easier to remove... but you probably won't be removing it much anyway.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars. Not a bad camera at all if your power cord works well and you don't mind the other, relative minor, negatives.<br /><br />NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.up).  *** OTHER ***  * It's hard to read license plates unless the car is right in front of you but this is typical for cameras of this resolution * Don't forget to remove the protective film over the lens * I thought about uploading some video from the drive cam but Amazon wouldn't show it in a resolution that does it justice.

"At first I thought these headphones were positively amazing. I got them for the price of $80 and I loved how comfortable they were, how light they were, and how nice they sounded (I'm no audiophile just a normal high school-er who hates apple quality headphones). After awhile though the left head piece kept popping off and eventually it wouldn't stay together for more than a few minutes. At the moment I'm trying to figure out how to get my warranty but the process is just so confusing. I will come back if I can figure out how this warranty works but for the moment the problem seems like its just on my end and no one else. All in all I really liked these headphones and I desperately want them fixed."
I got this in mail on time as expected delivery date. The speaker work well the down fall is it do not come with an charger.
"[[VIDEOID:707cf6246cd1ab02536589a3e25d71c3]]I am forever losing (and leaving behind) my wall plugs. So I opted for these as they came in a set of two. Honestly I need one for every room in the house as I'm attached to my phone and charging is something of a routing throughout the day.  What I loved about these is the indentations on the side. They made it easy to plug and unplug- I was able to grasp it with minimal slippage when removing them from the outlet. They are small and compact- easy to toss in bag or pocket for traveling. They arrived in a simple but basic packaging but truthfully I liked the less packaging- less waste. Now I have a little concern with them getting `warm', however all my gadgets are plugged into surge protectors for extra security. Overall my phone charges just fine and I now have two more to replace the ones that magically disappeared. I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR"
This wallet/wristlet is wonderful. The magnet that holds the phone to the wallet is very strong. There are several credit card slots and enough room to hold more than one card. The leather is soft and it is very smooth. I love this wallet.
First time arrived broken so I requested a replacement which arrived cracked as well. I don't believe thIs product can protect my screen.
Not comfortable.The wires are too stiff and wide to make the earbuds feel invisible.
Arrived quickly. I would order again but the price has went up 20 dollars but the one i installed works well.  My screen is broke again though. Could be faulty
A Tom Tom will not fit in this model. I found out the hard way.
Love these cases they are light and easy to use.. Very light on the belt and doesn't feel like it's weighing down ur pants...they are great!
Decent.  Not OEM but a close 2nd.
"Superb...<br />Great case, good protection, feels great in your hand, and a [low price]... what more can you want from a case???"
"Well, I bought one, and it worked fine for a few months. But I dropped my phone, and the screen cracked, not the screen protector. very disappointing. Woulnd't buy another one."
"It's a hard shell case with rubber sides that line the edge of the screen. The wave pattern in the back adds some texture but not enough. I found myself still tightly holding my phone just in case. The back protects the camera well.<br />Overall, this case does okay. It will protect your phone from minor drops and bumps but its smooth design causes it to slide on desks and other flat surfaces."
"fits great, nice and slim. I usually like to go naked but this is next to it. Plastic is of high quality soft touch material. Easy to clean. Great price!<br />Thinking of buying a couple more for back ups. Would recomend to iphone 5 owners becuase of the squared chamfered edges."
"Unfortunately,  these reviews come in after I purchased the screen protector.  This is misleading as it does not cover the entire screen.  What a waste of time waiting for this to be delivered."
"At first look it just looks like a regular phone case, but then when you look at it closer you notice that there is a place for your cards<br /><br />I'm able to hold 3 credit cards and a folded up bill in it.<br /><br />Does what it needs to do!"
"I was looking into Bluetooth earbuds and these had good ratings.  In fact, nothing negative.  Which is very unusual. And all of the reviews were very brief, and most included shipping and packing accolades.<br /><br />I was suspicious of all of these 5 star ratings so I took a look at the majority of the reviewers.  Low and behold, it's amazing the vast majority never posted before the date of their review.<br /><br />In what I suspect to be a means to add legitimacy to their reviews, some have two or three items listed, however they are reviewed on the same date as their review for this product.<br /><br />And what really leads me to suspect most of these are bogus reviewers many of them have purchased the exact items.  Sorry, too much of a coincidence for me."
item just exactly as was described .. i love it look like a brand new phone
"If I had to give a one-word description of this case It would be &#34;minimalist&#34;. And, that was the main reason I purchase this particular case. I wanted something that would fit in my pocket. But the thin and sleek profile comes at a cost. The phone is held in place by pressure fit of the corners and a narrow lip along most of the right edge. Consequently the phone tends to pop out with even the slightest drop. I don't believe this case offers a great deal of protection if you are prone to drop your phone often.<br /><br />Build quality appears good and I like the magnetic closure on the flap. The buttons are easy to access and the whole bottom of the phone is exposed which means I can rest this phone in my cradle with the case on. That's a real bonus since all other cases required me to take the phone out of the case before mounting it in my charging cradle/clock radio base.<br /><br />As long as you know what you're getting yourself in for this should be a fine case. I would like to give a higher than a 3 star rating but the grip on the phone is just a bit too light."
Not satisfied with the charge time it's better then some but what was expected but the looks are great looks nice and great size
It's a good charger however there's no charger to charge the case.
the package was supposed to have 10 bands but only contained 9 rings.  AND one of them was damaged.........And Getwow has refunded me part of the cost of this product.  Thank you!  They are working out great with my fitbit bands.
Thank you!
"This case protects my phone great. I know it's not waterproof, and neither is the phone, but I dropped my phone in the river yesterday while fishing and the case kept my phone dry and my phone didn't get damaged at all. I'd definitely would recommend this case for this phone."
Fits my iPhone perfectly! Very happy with this purchase.
"Shipping took a while but it works great! The one thing is that it can't hold your phone vertically, so if you want to do that you have to twist its little octopus legs a lot and have your horizontally-clipped phone held sideways... doesn't work great but it'll do in a pinch. For most of my horizontal-phone recordings (widescreen style), works great!"
Did not work for my phone (samsung galaxy legend) despite it being in the product title. the plug fit in the phone but the phone never charged. waste of money.
My wife loves loves loves this case. It fits perfect and has held up great over the last 8 months. People stop her all the time telling her they love the color.
i like the design but the volume was not loud enough for me. the headset last most of the day and the play or talk time is about 4 hours<br /><br />the recharge light is ok. the first one i had the red charging light was kind of dim
Just what I needed. thanks for the good customer service.
"Battery worked good for about 3 weeks, then the case split open and all functions stopped.  Battery seems to be very susceptible to heat damage, as I charged it in the velour pouch they give you to carry it in, the case separated and functions stopped."
Water damaged phone wouldn't charge.  Fast swap and great price. The phone now works.
Had to clip down the volume buttons. They were too long and kept pushing the volume either up or down with the slightest touch.
"This product completely meets my needs. It provides protection for the back and corners, fits tightly, is very lightweight, provides a nice transparent casing to show off the iPad, and provides a firm grip when working on the iPad on one hand. It is ideal for In-home use, and if I need more protection for outside trips, I have a zipped case that this fits nicely into."
"Awesome product! Plugged right in and started listening to music off my iPhone. Also realized there is an adapter to charge as well built into the device, bonus! My last one I purchased from Best Buy for $40. This one is a fraction of the price."
"It's just a clip - but adds a Fish-Eye, Wide Angle, and a Macro lens for your creative needs. The clip has a long reach in case your camera lens is offset from the edge of your device. Each has an easy-to-remove lens cap and an icon to indicate the lens type. My favorite is the Fish-Eye lens, but the Macro lens allows you to take some very creative close-ups.<br /><br />The only problem I found is my HTC phone has two camera lenses. Not using both gives me an error message, but I can still take a picture. Get these lenses and let your creativity run wild!"
"Gook phone, looks beautiful, worth the price."
Rubber can get loose after a while and you'll just find yourself closing it again. May have to remove the iPod every now and then to clean the ipod and plastic of dust build up in corners that are difficult to get. Otherwise its good and provides good protection if paired with a screen protector.
"Great battery that held a long charge. I was surprised how awesome this battery was given my previous experience with a battery order from a different company that turned out to be warped. I was wary but grateful this turned out to be a very good purchase decision. Definitely worth a reorder in the future, as needed."
"only down side is the position of the adjuster button on the backside hits the vent and opens the adjustable arms so that my phone is no longer tightly fitting.  This happens due to the heavy weight of my phone with it's case (samsung note 2).  I just have to keep an eye on it and be aware not to let it rest on the vent so it hits the button, kinda a pain, but other than that it's working great so far"
definitely the best phone case i've ever purchased. it's really high quality and protects my phone really well. i've dropped my phone a lot in this case and it has stood up well to the impact. the colors are really vibrant and lovely!
"Works as advertised, though I'm afraid that it might break the vent louvers unless I'm careful."
Braide cables are fabulous. I'm glad I found Anker products!!!!!!
"Product arrived on time in perfect condition. The only issue is that it starts to get dirty after about two weeks, no matter how well you treat the case."
My special needs daughter uses the stylys with her iPad and it's so nice to be able to replace the tip instead of the whole stylus.  They hold up very well.
"Works well, I could not find this case when I searched for a case for the Note Edge, but seen a review and purchased it... the only case in my opinion. GREAT!!!!"
When I first got the product I turned it on and it worked perfectly but it Doesn't keep a charge or pair with my phone
broke 1st week !
"Nice sleek product nice fit , could have been better on bass - good for run/workout.overall worth the money spent"
"Works great, doesn't slip out of CD slot, and holds the firm securely. Only problem in the cars I've used it in makes it difficult to see radio channel and time."
It's working properly as describe. I highly recommended this product to everyone.
"Product covers entire surface of iPhone 6, cutout for the home button is very precise. This was not my first purchase from intelliarmor so I have had experience installing previous products. I was a little disappointed with the installation accessories, mostly because the cleaning film was flimsy and didn't take off 100% if the dust. I was able to use some of the installation accessories from the M9 screen protector I had installed right before. But the product itself once installed is perfect."
"after a while the battery doesnt stay charged for days, it stays chardged for longer time period than regular batteries though"
"Very good looking case. The swivel belt clip is a real plus, but I'm not certain about its longevity. This is why I've given it a four star rating. It's fitted very well for the Moto E (second gen.) The presence of a very thin shell protector on the back of the phone results in difficulty when placing it in the case and removing it as well. I would recommend against using a shell protector if one is considering this carrying case for a purchase. I know because I tried to use one on my own Moto E and had these very problems.<br /><br />A thoughtful feature on this case is the metal covering over the lower edge of the belt clip. The faux leather covering over the steel spring always wears out first at that edge. This leaves the lower part of the clip exposed and the clip itself usually has sharp edges on it. This has always resulted in needing to replace a case even though the rest of it was still in good shape."
these saved my day and product after i made the purchase - fast shipping and great quality
"Foam pads, meant to make a snug fit, fell off within first 10 days of use. Otherwise okay. Buy super glue at the same time you buy this."
"This case fits perfect and looks awesome but you definitely lose some wifi and data connectivity. I noticed it as a decrease in range, not so much in speed so it may not affect everyone."
"Great case, protects my phone very well.  True test was when I dropped my phone and nothing happened to my phone."
I've previously purchased head case design products and I have not been disappointed until I received this particular case. When I put it on the dimensions were off and it barely fit over my phone. I loved the design but did not meet up with my expectations.
"Super cheap, replaced old one that lasted about three years.  Now using it as my off line music library.  Have a 32g card in it. :)  By the way, Galaxy S2 was still going strong.  Had to upgrade because Sprint said it would no longer support it."
"Works great! Lost my good one that told me who was calling.  But, this one does a good job, easy to pair, easy to use."
"This has been a lifesaver for me, as I carry it with me in my backpack all the time.  The only thing I would suggest to the company is to find a way to make the recharging time a little shorter.  It takes all night to charge this battery. It was an awesome buy though.  And having a flashlight with me has came in handy a couple  of times.  I would also suggest to anyone buying a external battery to buy a big one (min of 10,000 mAh) because even if you forget to charge it will last 4-5 times of charging a large cell phone battery."
Got this for Christmas 8 months ago and 2 of the 5 ports are no longer charging.  I am *very* dissappointed with this as I asked for this and was so happy with it until recently. I will be writing to Anker also about the issue. #dissatisfiedcustomer
"Worked like a charm for a while but then stopped charging my phone, and have to connect and reconnect the charger to my phone and try and change the angle the I plug the cord in at to try and make sure it charges. No issues with other power cords I use. Should have paid more for higher quality."
"This was something I was looking forward to using, but I was not happy with how it felt. It has a slot for a credit card or ID and a flip open slot for another card or credit card. The slot holds my card in place securely, but I would prefer not having it exposed and someone noticing I have a credit card in my phone case. The flip top seems a bit weak and I do not feel like it is going to keep my card in its place. It has not opened up, but the magnet just does not seem strong enough. The design looks pretty on my phone and is sturdy and feels like it will protect it well. I would use it just for protection and not to secure my cards.  I purchased this at a discount, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions."
"There's no question that Otterbox is superior, but the contrast between the medium and dark blue is awesome. It arrived very quickly and I am very satisfied."
"Nice product and price! Wish it came with just a few more small lanyards and less of the big ones. The small lanyards are made of a nicer, sportier, more attractive material. The large ones are flimsier and less attractive. But I am still giving this a high rating because the colors are nice, the quality is good, and the price was reasonable. I am using the big ones for my flash drives, and the 2 small ones I received will be for electronic devices."
"Dead after 5 months, barely used. Can't get in touch with anyone about warranty."
"Best thin case there is. (4.5 stars)<br />I'm testing a few other cases and wraps for the Note 5 and this is truly a thin fit.  I'm not a case guy, I feel like you take away the beauty of a modern phone when you try to gussy it up, but also the slim slide and fit into your pocket is lost on most cases.  I'm looking at these because the Note 5 glass back is a finger oil magnet!<br />My feedback with percentages to ‘weigh’ the values of each:<br />Pros:<br />-Ultra thin and light, this plus glass protector, all I need if I'm doing a case (80%)<br />-Buttons don't have covers, this is fantastic.  Many cases have good ways to get access but they always loose some level of tactile native use.  Bravo (20%)<br />Cons:<br />-Not really a good 'bumper' case, as they've got split corners instead of re-enforced.  While this helps with my thin case desire, I don't think any common corner drops will help.  Time will tell (70%)<br />-The back is slightly greasy fingerprint prone.  Wish they would or will make a textured ultra-thin back (carbon fiber!) (25%)<br />-Spigen puts &#34;Auto Focus&#34; on the back of many/all cases.  I don't get it.  If they wanted a standard decorating companion to their logo, they could find much better I’m not marketing guy but contact me and we'll come up with a jazzy slogan like &#34;Just shoot it&#34; or &#34;Peep hole&#34; (5%)<br />I purposely didn't buff up the case to show the fingerprints, so this is why they lost half a star, but we all buff our phones a few times a day anyway, just wanted to show you.<br />I've bought 3 cases so far this is the one I'm using as primary.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
Seems to be living up to its reputation but I have only had its month . I would recommend it to others
"The seller was on top of things without even initiating communicating with them. Sellers such as those you appreciate when they check in after the purchase. In addition, selling a nice case (firm texture and tight fit) at such an affordable price, plus 2 day shipping? You can't ask for more."
It works. Which is great. It has a sticker on it which was thrown on in the wrong spot. So I had to move it and you know if you move adhesive then it never sticks well again! And if you have more than one battery? Then you will basically never have it stick again. I took it off my battery when it was not sticking well as is anymore and now I have to hold it down and as I place my cover down... be veryyyy careful it does not slide off. You are trying to keep the left side part that is sticking out to stay in contact with at all times. It is a bit tricky to do. I tried to use tape but then it would not charge. So I had to take tape off.<br /><br />It is nice it is thin and does not require a new cover. Some require their own cover which is larger vs the one that comes with your own cell. And i found my Samsung s3 charges faster wirelessly vs the old way.
"For the price it is a bargain. Minus one star for the back clip slightly short and it would sometimes fall off the vent. I suppose it depends how your vent is shaped. Regardless, it does the job and good value."
"I love the case design, but definitely isn't the most protection. Granted I have dropped my phone a few times and it has lived without scratches or cracks lol"
Easy installation. Battery continues to work like the new garmin.
"If you own an Android phone, buy this. These cords complete quality. The charging heads are very small, so it even fit my gigantic waterproof case.<br />YES, this has 2.1 Amp Charging. Many people who own an Android phone NEED THIS."
Impossible to perform a hard reset by myself. Had to send it back because it is impossible to remove the battery and no procedure for hard resetting otherwise.
"A tiny little device with a big impact!  The Lumo Lift was easy to set up with clear app instructions.  I find that the device works not only when I'm wearing it but also when I'm not--I have become more mindful of my posture at all times.  A healthy neutral posture is about more than just straightening up and performing a &#34;shoulders back,&#34; of course--and the Lumo Lift is designed to bring focus only to your upper body positioning.  However, it's an important place to start and I'm definitely digging the healthy feedback from the Lumo Lift.  You won't be disappointed.  (P.S.  Their customer service is terrific.  I had a question and received a response in ~ 24 hours.  Yay!)"
"I've been replacing all breaking cords withe these over time and I love them.<br />The quality of insulation is great and I'm sure they will stand the test of time.<br />And how convenient is this multi-length set!  I use the long one for my son's tablet in the car (he's in the back seat), the medium ones in the front seat or at my office desk, and the shortest stays with my travel/lipstick chargers for charging on the go.<br /><br />Not to mention that the company is great: They stand behind their products and are service oriented."
"Only one problem with idems, it is not a slide out clip on case it is very hard to take phone out of clip need two hands to take phone into your hands from clip on."
"Tried two of these and both were a poor fit.  Must use extra force to push it in and again to pull it out.  The issue with this is that the phone's female receptor does not have a infinite tolerance for being forced and if forced repeatedly over time, can break off its mount and actually get pushed into the phone.  Happened to my last Galaxy phone which I had to replace prematurely.  Not taking that risk again here."
"I have only had this for a few days, but I love it.  It was the easiest screen protector to apply that I have had.  The screen is very clear and much easier to clean.  Even though I haven't tested out the protection quality (I haven't dropped my phone) I highly recommend this product!"
Great looking case! Allows the phone aesthetics to truly shine and the case fit perfectly. I feel like my phone is well protected from any possible drops. Would definitely recommend for those who want a non-bulky and durable case.
Color is so much cuter in person. Love it! Arrived 2 days ahead of schedule awesome! Edited I have owned this case for maybe 2 months already. My phone has fallen and all still no cracks or damages. I really love the way this case was built. I wish they had more cases to choose from. I love my owl case but sometimes I like to change the skins. Truly one of the best cases I have bought other than the otter box this has to be my favorite!  LOVE IT!!
this is a great case for the money. It has a good design and fits well on my phone. It prevents any dust/dirt accumulation and is relatively water resistance. It provides protection without addidng significant size.  I give it 5 Stars. Additionally the ability to change colors of the case is a nice addition
"The duration of the batery is excelent, eight days, i really like the pebble market, a great election cost-benefit"
Strong and attractive case. My only complaint is that the thickness of the case does nor allow me to insert certain headphone plugs
"This case is sturdy and cute.  It is sometimes difficult to plug in certain audio receivers, but otherwise this case is a great fit!"
One of the best<br />But this time I was disappointed in<br />However healthier to buy
There was mentioned in description that it's going with warranty. But the phone was sent without it and even without manual
"I got this phone in an emergency, because my old phone died and I needed a basic replacement in a hurry before I got my new phone in the fall. I love this phone as a basic phone. This may be the best economical phone that there is! It's true, that this is very slow, but besides this phone being slow, it's pretty awesome! And, not all parts are slow, I'm able to text and unlock it with the speed of a very quick phone. I just can't play very many games on it. This ended up being great, because I'm vacationing in Nicaragua next month, so I've been trying to learn Spanish, and I've been using mainly Duolingo on this phone. And, it's awesome at Duolingo, and other lightweight applications. The GPS on this phone actually worked better than it does with all of my other phones, which was pretty awesome.<br /><br />I also like that it's small and easy to hold. Most phones are a little too big, and this one is perfect. It fits in my pocket without bulging. It's thin, but not too thin, too, so for me, it's a perfect size. It takes the giant SIM cards, so I had to get an extender so that my regular SIM card would fit, but it ended up working out great. I could have gone to T-Mobile to get a new SIM card, but they charge me for everything. And, it takes two SIM cards. There are a ton of features about what to use with what. So, you can use data only with one SIM and phone only with the other SIM, if you want. And, you can switch back and forth with an Android setting, if you want, too. I wasn't able to test this out, since I just have one SIM, but the interface looks cool. There's not much space on this, only about 1GB free when you start, so you'll need to watch the memory closely, and get an SD card where you push most of your stuff to. And, it's stuck on Android 4.2. There was one update, but it just updated it to another version of Android 4.2. Oh, and something else that i loved, is that it has a reboot option. With most Androids, you can't just reboot, so I love Blu for including this.<br /><br />I have to warn you again that it's slow. To get the most out of this phone, make sure that you don't have very much installed, and get a task killer to use before you need any kind of performance. But the slowness is all usually in between application switches, and with it doing things more slowly than other phones. This is basically like a Yaris with four big people in it, and 500 lbs in the trunk. It will go, but won't go up hills very fast. And, just like the Yaris, I love this phone!<br /><br />Overall, this is awesome. And, if you're okay with a slower phone, this would be a great phone. I used it for a month before i got my new Moto G, and now I'm going to keep it as a backup phone, or if a friend loses a phone. And, this would be an awesome phone for a child or a mom who keeps breaking or losing their phone. And, I'm a 43-year old man, and it was a great phone for me, too.cluding this.<br /><br />I have to warn you again that it's slow.

"Great seller. Product was even better than I expected. Perfect for just grabbing the essentials when you're running errands. Very well made, and a great bargain."
Didn't fit the phone at all! This thing would up sitting on the table until I threw it away!
"Fast shipping,  good pricing, and exactly what i needed."
Awesome  product! Doesn't look bulky in the car...
I love this case! It fits my phone perfectly and I love the bling! Also have to say that I rec'd my order very fast. I will order again in the future.
"I've used a Samsung Galaxy S3 for two years.  Nightly charging to 100%, daily use.  Over time, the original battery slowly faded until the point that 9 hours of light use ran the battery from 100% down to 20%.  I bought & installed this new battery.  After charging it once, I thought it was just as bad (3 hours of heavy dropped from 100% to 50%).  After 2 more charges, the battery is much better (9 hours of light use from 100% to 62%).  I have much more freedom now, and am no longer so afraid to use my phone because of the battery.  Works well -- give the new battery a few days of charging before deciding if it's better or not.  Works great for me!"
These headphones changed my life. I recommended this to my professor.
"[[ASIN:B00ZC8X8EU [Smart AI Rapid Charging Technology] RoyPow 5V 5.2A 26W Dual-Port USB Car Charger Cigarette Charger for Apple iPhone iPad, iPod, Samsung Galaxy Google Nexus 7, Fire Phone, White]] I purchased this usb  car charger at a discount in exchange of an unbiased review. I got this item on time and the packaging is well made. I found this car charger very useful. I use it a few times now in my car. The two port devices are really functional. Perfect because we have two iphones on the go. It's the right time to change my old one since my old usb car charger are getting tired of me, i've been using it for a very long time. Once you plug them in, the blue light will come out it means its working and ready to use. The deal I got for this product is all worth once this product will last for a long time. but I have a good feeling."
it is great as expected for a phone case.
"Really disappointed in the stability of the swivel piece. Can't hold phone sideways, the only position that works is upright and straight ahead. Any kind of tilt and it flops over. Would not buy again."
"This seemed to be a good idea, but the adhesive on the glass would not spread out to the full screen size, leaving a corner unstuck with a bubble under the whole corner clear to the edge.  Nothing I tried would fix this, so the screen saver is worthless.  I would not buy this one again."
This is a fantastic charger. We used it on a family camping trip to recharge several iPhones and it was amazing.
"If you're like me and take great care of your product, you will love this case. It's thin and minimal and adds some design but doesn't overtake the beauty of the phone. Not meant or made for someone who drops their phones all the time. I've had the same case for my iPhone 5s and now I love it even more on my iPhone 6."
I put this in my 2011 genesis coupe and it hits super hard not too much though still sounds clean. I highly recommend
I like the phone it is as good as any android I have used. I am currently researching how to use it's cloud features with Gmail back office apps due to the fact it does not handle things the same way the android phone does for those that use Gmail as a UC system.
"Not sure why everybody rate it 5 stars. For me, this thing started to break after 2 months. First it's just one port not working. I was like &#34;OK, at least I still got 4 working ports&#34;. But then they just quit functioning one after another. Now I only got one working port after 3 months, and not sure when it will turn into a brick.<br /><br />Now after reading through all the negative reviews, it seems that this is definitely not some &#34;rare&#34; incident. It's pretty common that this thing will stop working after 3 months. I'm wondering why so many &#34;5 star&#34; ratings - this seems really suspicious. I can only guess there's some kind of &#34;Paid Review&#34; or &#34;Review Scam&#34; going on here. I hope Amazon could launch some investigation into this, to see why such piece of crap could get reviewed so high, out of no reason."
I bought two of these at the same time.  One still works great but the other one broke.  The suction cup melted to the plastic and will not suction to the window anymore.  I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem.
Excellent product.  The four charge slots performed flawlessly and fast.
"if you are looking for a great screen protector to help keep  damaging marks and accidents on your childs favorite Nabi Big Tab, then this product is NOT IT.  I have bought many different screen protectors for different applications and devices from a variety of manufacturers over the years. some were oaky, some were good, some were awesome. this one didn't make the list.<br />I researched the product before buying, to study up on the application, the durability, and the reviews. while this product makes sense in some on some devices because of the sizes and mediocre quality, this is in no way made for the protection on investment of my Nabi Big Tab. the application process just does not work for the 20&#34; inch screen size. 4  units came with my order and i gave up after the third attempt. the manufacturer should redesign a new material and process for large applications because working on anything bigger than a 10&#34; tablet just doesn't make sense for this material. the seller was a good choice as the shipping was fast, but this product just failed miserably."
Its ok. The kickstand broke after a week and I  broke a paper clip in half and fixed it with that. Cheap material.
I bought this for my s4 and an otterbox commuter case for my husband 1 year ago. We both accidentally dropped our phones on the ground a few times. Now he's looking for a new case while mine still works perfectly and only has some scratches on the back.
"his was a gift for my grandson-I asked him if he liked them and he said &#34;Yes! &#34; And when you're talking about 8 year old boys, that's a good response!"
ordered a new battery for my samsung galaxy III phone and it came on time and works great.
Bought it for my kid's iPhone.  It's cheap and ugly.  I'm not sure how long it will last.  The green part of the case doesn't seem very durable and it's a little ill fitting.
This case fit my phone well but trying to put my id and two cards made it almost impossible to keep closed.
"Unlike some other car stereos listed on Amazon, this one actually works, and works reasonably well. Once you get used to the buttons arrangement it's a breeze to operate. I would have preferred a unit wit a remote control but one can't have everything for a reasonable price these days. My only concern is that the unit was made in china and my experience with their goods is that they are largely kraap and have the lasting power of a tissue in a bonfire. We'll see. All of that notwithstanding, the volume is reasonable, the sound adequate, the radio sensitivity marginally acceptable and the ergonomics decent. I give this radio four stars because it didn't smoke out or detonate in 3 nanoseconds."
"I read the reviews before I purchased this case because I wanted to make sure that it'll protect my phone if I accidentally dropped it. I thought it looked really sturdy and well built based on the reviews, description and pictures but the whole case is made out of plastic. I was surprised by the material because I thought that the cover was going to be made out of rubber. The &#34;rubber&#34; part of the case feels like plastic. I got the silver case because it looked so nice on the pictures but mine already had some scratches and was a bit of a dull color. This case did not protect my phone from damages when it accidentally fell about 3 feet of the wooden floor and ended up breaking the screen. I paid for this product alongside a screen protector which I believe is from a different company and ended up wasting almost $40 and my time. I wish I just bought the otter box instead of being thrifty."
Love it I can work around the yard without carrying my iPod around<br />Sound is clear and you can even change songs with the push of a button on the headphones
is lousy need to stop the loading least two months in the sun to achieve load as need to connect your phone for 5 hours to achieve a 20 percent charge<br /><br />Es pésimo necesitas dejarlo cargando mínimo dos meses en el sol para que se logre cargar por completo mientras que tu teléfono necesitas conectarlo 5 horas para que se logre cargar un 20 por ciento
"I instantly loved the look of these headphones! They’re very modern looking and different. I was looking for a lightweight, sleek alternative to getting my headphone cable yanked out anytime I caught it on something at the gym. These did the trick and they're incredibly comfortable. Sound quality isn’t generally high on my list of demands, especially since I have cats and can’t have nice things. But I was pleasantly surprised at how good these sounded on top of everything."
"Every time I attempt to use the wall charger, a printed message on my Garmin Nuvi says &#34;The connected cable is not compatible with traffic for this device. Traffic service is disabled. Connect the correct power cable to receive traffic service.&#34;<br />I am not sure whether the device actually can charge the Garmin, since the Garmin is new, and the battery is currently fully charged. Gomadic/Amazon refunded my money, and Gomadic did not want me to return the charger. Everyone has been cooperative."
"I bought this cellphone, to save money on calls made in wifi, but nooooo,  my minutes were going  fast as I keep checking the balance with the tracfone widget, even calls to tracfone costumer service to fix my issue were not free eigther."
The clip to release the phone from the holster can be a little difficult but overall works great.
A very good Camera in its class
Product works with nice lights. But its producing high frequency sound. quite annoying
Bought this case and loved it at first until it broke a week later! Definitely cheaply made. Not worth buying again.
"Quick receipt of product. Good quality. Fits snug as a bug, works very well."
Normally charge at night. Can't use it by bedside because of bright blinking blue lights while charging.
"These headphones are the best I have ever purchased and probably the most affordable. They sit so comfortably and there is no movement from the headphone. Yes, i swear they stay exactly how you put them in. The cord does not have that pulling motion that yanks the headphones out of the ear ear while your arms are pumping. The sound is great I am not a sound engineer, but there is a perfect blend in bass and treble. I love that I can adjust the volume from the ear piece and change songs. I love that it is Bluetooth. I now can take my phone and use Spotify for my runs and have my phone in my hydration pack instead of on my arm."
This thing was good just didn't work out for what I needed which was a phone mount on my boat. It couldn't handle the vibration at full speed. The suction held but the arm would flop down and finally snapped off. For a car this would be awesome.  Update- great service from seller on warranty!
These earbuds are user friendly..fairly comfortable.stay In your ear.I use them at the gym( lighting weights.sit ups..and tread mill running..no problems what do ever.give it a try.worth it.worst case it makes a great back up.next option up is nasty bird scale and power beats2
"I purchased two of these to charge my new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, one for work and one for home<br /><br />PRO's : The unit is small, very stylish and looks good sitting on my nightstand.  When I place my phone on it it begins charging right away.  There are a lot of blue LED lights that blink while the phone is charging and stay solid when the phone is charged.  On my desk at work, I live this product.<br /><br />CON's : I wish there was a way to turn off the LED's and they can be very distracting at night.<br /><br />OTHER : While this unit does come with a USB cable, it does not include an AC plug in.  I discovered that if I use the quick charge AC plug that came with my phone with this charger, it works great but if I use a cheap non quick charger it charges very slow.  I ended up going to Frt's and spending $20.00 to get a AC 2.0 charger to plug this into.<br /><br />Also I don't know if its this charger of the Verus S6 Edge plus case I bought but the phone will not charge wireless with this charger and that case and I'm not sure if that is an issue with the output of this charger or the thickness of the case."
"Perfection, arrived quickly ahead of time, friends tell me (I can't see ur screen, is ur phone off) perfect!"
"I bought it for the eventual EARTHQUAKE, when we lose power,  So far, it works very well (during testing...not an earthquake.)"
Product came in cracked so I tried using it anyway.. Finally just bought another one ..it seemed pretty good just didn't like the fact it was broke when I got it.
Simple black case that fits really well. I think It makes the side buttons easier to press.
"Based on my experience with another TomTom product (XL 340), I would not recommend anything from this company. The company is, in fact, sending me E-mails that border on spam because there is no unsubscription link in the E-mails (that I can find) and no way to delete the account without contacting customer service.<br /><br />Here is my experience with the XL 340<br />Unreliable and unmaintainable junk<br /><br />After I attempted to perform the last recommended map update, I got a flashing red X on the screen. In addition, TomTom Home said the device was not connected to the computer, even though Windows and File Manager recognized its presence.<br /><br />I do give TomTom technical support 5 stars for effort; the representative made every possible effort to recommend solutions . None of these worked, though, and neither did those posted online at TomTom.com. I was told that TomTom would give me a 20 percent discount if I purchased another; my response was that I was not going to reward poor quality by actually purchasing another product from that company. I just<br />bought a Garmin Nuvi 2555LMT as a replacement today.<br /><br />I was also told that, if the TomTom is old and the memory chip is &#34;worn out,&#34; it will not accept map updates, and will display the flashing red X on the screen. As far as I know, and I have some professional experience in the semiconductor industry, memory chips do not &#34;wear out&#34;--unless they are unreliable trash such as might be produced offshore under substandard conditions. In addition, the memory chip is not replaceable even though flash memory is relatively cheap nowadays; this means the product is not designed for maintainability either. That is, it does not meet the basic requirements of design for reliability and maintainability. (Does not constitute formal engineering advice, but this is more along the lines of common sense--e.g. the TomTom is similar to a light socket in which you cannot replace the bulb, or a flashlight in which you cannot replace the battery).<br /><br />As a result of the need to buy the same thing (GPS navigation device) twice because it didn't work right the first time, TomTom is permanently disqualified from selling me anything in the future."
Works as advertised. Happy customer here.
very superior Case 5 Stars
Actually really easy to install and protects the screen. Unfortunately it seemed to attract more dust during installation than others.
"It works surprisingly well. I spend a fair amount of time on conference calls. With this unit I'm heard clearly on calls, I can hear others clearly, and functions like mute are readily available. The fact that I can pop this in my backpack when I need to travel is a pleasant bonus. Frankly, I didn't think I'd ever do that until I tried it. I've taken this on quick trips to client locations etc where it continues to be a great little phone. Technically, it was easy to pair with my iPhone etc... I'd recommend it to others."
"The &#34;no annoying error messages&#34; claim is a load of crap. I got that error message the very first time I plugged this cord into my phone. And as you can see from the photo, the error message is on my iPad as well. Notice how the cord is plugged in, but there's no indicator that it's charging. A good 10 seconds after I took the photo, it did finally start to charge. When it is charging it does seem to charge at a decent rate. Time will tell whether it continues to work or not."
"Headset works perfectly for my needs. Sound quality is good. Earbuds fit comfortably in my ears, but do not always stay in place. I love the remote control/mic. I listen to audiobooks while I walk my dog and while I am doing laundry or housework, the remote makes it easy to pause/play or take a call without having to take my phone out of my bag. Also included was a nice little zipper case to store the headset in."
Now when I'm out I don't have to look for a place to charge my phone is the best thing we came out with I love it so much
Nice feel.  Quality construction.  Strong magnet keeps inside case in place in the wallet.
"i am very disappointed. the connector does not even fit into my phone, so i have to force it in. when i take it out of my phone i have to wiggle it and pull on it hard, possibly damaging my phone in the process. definitely not worth my money."
Doesn't work at all with Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. I've tried every position with and without the case. Useless.
Thrilled with this!  No longer need a long cable to connect directly to modem!
This case has protected my phone from a few hard falls I love it. My only complaint an reason for 4 stars is the kick stand was very hard to open at first. I had to pry it open with a flathead screwdriver a few times to loosen it up.
"Very good quality and a rich look,  I have had people comment on the nice look of it.  Very happy!"
Its a good case and has done a good job at protecting my phone. However i found over and over again that dirt and other particles can easily get behind the screen protector. I have to take it off and clean it at least twice a week. I work in landscape construction so for me this case isn't working out very well. My phone is either in the work truck or in my pocket. Its never just left laying around. Currently looking for a new case.
Got for my kid to use so I didn't have to listen to their you tube videos and games and horrible music and all other noises emanating from their ipads 24x7.  Manufacturer is awesome - and very responsive following a query on when the product would be available again.  The charges last a long time.  The extra cables and storage bag and everything else are a plus.  My kids love to dance around without wires and never adopted other wired headphones previously.  I totally recommend this product.
My wife loves these on her iPads.  She uses them for all three iPads she has.
Poor quality<br />Keeps disconnected<br />Does not stay connected to cigarette lighter
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this skin for a Zune HD, but it was nice to see that it installed easily, and had attractive bevels on the back which mimic the HD's case.  With this and a screen protector, the only thing exposed now is the single small button on the front.  The side button is pressed easily through the silicone sleeve.  For the price, this is a steal, and I may very well order another sleeve or two for future use."
My daughter has only has this for a few weeks and the part of the case that holds the phone in place is completely breaking apart. I told her I would look into getting a replacement but it seems I'm a few days past the return policy. Wish I would have emailed them when the problem started which was almost immediately.
Feels like good quality. Works with my Galaxy S6 fast charger. I guess time will tell but so far so good.
"Not giving it 5 stars yet because I've only had it for a day.  However, as far as I can tell this case is great fits very well. All buttons and cut outs match the phone. I am able to charge the phone with the case on with no issues. Each corner of case has a slight ridge that prevents camera lens to touch surface. Great product so far."
"great fit and comfort, battery life at 4.5 hours is a pain to charge often, and the interruption of signal can occur easily if iPhone or other device is not worn correctly, get a belt to hold the iPod on right side and there is limited issues"
This unit returned. The signal strength at my home is not strong enough to overcome the cable loss from antenna to amplifier.  I think it would work fine if one had at least one bar on phone.  The unit was received in good contion and timely as promised by sellar.
"Best earbuds I have ever bought, and I have owned some Beats and other name brands. Fits comfortably and really does knock out outside noise; I usually wear earbuds mowing the lawn, and often had to crank other buds up to overcome the lawnmower sound. With these, I can play at a normal level, which I suspect is better for my hearing, and mower is just a light buzz, at the most. Also have a Symphonized Bluetooth speaker, and would (wood?) definitely buy more of their products."
"the piece of junk arrived today. it flashed, popped and went off and on for several minutes. then it settled down with one led dead, one barely lit and 3 that randomly have convulsions of dim, off or super bright. This THING never worked properly or was even tested before you shipped it. I hope Amazon will drop your sorry ass as a pitiful vendor. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO????????? as for those potential suckers who are considering ordering this thing I suggest you RUN AWAY AND NOT JUST WALK AWAY!!!!!!"
"LOVE IT!! Wow! What a great bargain! This case is perfectly clear and nice and rubbery! It feels just like the much more expensive one that I purchased at the Apple store for my iPhone5 way back when. I love that the case covers the back of the phone, while keeping all the necessary slots open. However, it loses 1 star because the lightening adapter does not fit! (Womp womp womp). Other than that it's a great buy!"
"Read the reviews and ordered two of these 6'ers. I really wanted a 10', but it sounds as though the phone end of the plug is different on it than the 6' and would be too big to fit my Lifeproof case. That being said, everything has worked flawlessly on these two."
These are amazing! They have a good range and great bass. My only concern is that they tend to fall off the ear.
OK not as good as manufacturers band but workable.
Bought it as a gift for my sister.  She loved it!
"This case is awesome. My wife got upset with me and threw my phone across the parking lot, the phone bounced off the ground a few times and I thought for sure it was going to be broken...not a scratch or a cracked screen. I've had this case for about a year now, dropped the phone many times, still in perfect condition"
It's nice to have a built in screen protector and it fits in my pocket well. Only criticism is that to charge the phone you have to take the case apart because the connection doesn't fit well into the phone through the case opening
Both of these cases did NOT fit the 5S at all.  While pretty and detailed these just did NOT work.  You can NOT get them to snap shut.
I really love this case. looks really nice and protects my iphone.  had a cheap one that didn't do a good job and had a chip on the corner of my iphone. would order again.
Very fast charging time.  No problems at all.
"Worked as advertised, very simple to use.  Worked for iPhone 4 so I'm not entirely sure if it works for anything else."
"My original Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman WT19i bought in 2011 was stolen, so I was ecstatic when I found this still on sale in 2014. Even if this one is fake, I'm still very happy that it's available for purchase, because I fall in love with this model back in 2011 and this phone is still quite enough for me even in 2015. The only problem is battery. It charges really fast, unrealistically fast I'd say. But runs down fast as well. Though maybe it's just me and other people might not have the same problem. Maybe it's not even a problem. My brother says that the original phone had this and I simply don't remember that. Anyway, the phone itself is great. Or was great back in his time. Its price justified its quality."
"To bad Garmin didn't give this the quality of their other products. Have owned for 2 years now, rarely use it anymore. I have owned other training collars and have worked for over 6 years with dog/dog training. I bought this for a Vizsla/lab mix puppy(9months). After opening seemed to be of decent materials that Garmin is know for. Operation could be easier. All the setting modes function differently and I need to carry manual or study in some detail to remember what each mode is and does. Other models I have owned are far easier to use and functions/mode is labeled on the transmitter making it much easier. The bark mode doesn't work as well as other bark collars I have. No real adjustment and doesn't sense dog bark a lot of the time making it useless for this purpose. As mentioned by others, battery life is terrible and slow to charge both transmitter and receiver. Need to plan my use the night before and recharge both units. Forget about charging on the go or replacing batteries in the field as that is not possible with this unit. First time in the field I took my dog to the mountains. Dog jumped into the water as most dogs do. Never a problem with my past unit. This one never worked again. It never went underwater deeper than Garmin said it could handle. The hand transmitter is more waterproof than the receiver the dog wears. They sure need improvement with its &#34;water resistance&#34; as they call it. Garmin was good about sending me a new one as it was under warranty, but I can't let my dog go close to any water. Living in the 2nd driest state, there is still stream, rivers, ponds, and lakes near about everywhere I take my dog making this product un-useable. I would look for another Brand as Garmin was a big disappointment. Glad I bought a aftermarket extended warranty, as this was newly on the market, I'm sure going to need it."
I have brought this phone from Amazon because my wife told me the site is trust worthy however on my arrival to barbados when I went to my local provider and did the necessary documents put the SIM card into the phone it have not work since I am so upset I have no clue what to do not good at all
This is a very colorful case that snaps easily onto your phone. The design is cute although the colors on the actual cover are not as vibrant as the image posted. It has a nice tactile finish. All the openings are perfectly accessible but I'm not sure how much protection this cover will really offer so it's really just for aesthetics. I received it for free from the manufacturer in return for a review but all of the opinions expressed are my own.
"This fit the LG L3 well, snapping on in place of the battery cover and matching the phone's contour  The material has a good feel and is slides pretty well into and out of a pocket without collecting a bunch of lint.  This is quite slim, not bulky in the least but doesn't feel flimsy.  It's been on the phone for a few weeks and seems to be holding up well, but it is a little sloppy and when it is closed over the screen it slides around a little.  The part touching the screen is soft, so there has been no scratching.  The LG LG has no buttons along the edges, only on the back and this case has cutout for them so everything was accessible.<br /><br />I took this off the phone a few minutes ago and went back to a case that doesn't have a flip-over screen cover.  It turns out I find this moderately annoying.  The way I use the phone, it gets in the way and in a few instances it has made the phone more difficult to hold.<br /><br />I purchased this because I was unsure if I would like a cover of this nature.  The LG version was quite a bit more money and many others seemed bulky.  Other cases like this MAY wake up or sleep the phone when opening or closing, this one does not.  This is a very minor piece of why I removed it.  It does what it was designed to do, it just turns out I don't love it."
Excellent sound. Great price.
"Having purchased multiple mobile accessories over the years, it seems that a few of the brand offerings stand out as far as quality, price, and customer service. RAVPower is one of them, with products that work as advertised at an excellent price. I measured the output of both outlets and they deliver 2.0 amps. Typically one is used for my RAVPower External Battery Pack, and the other to charge my Note 3 phone. I keep this plugged in near my kitchen where people tend to congregate during gatherings... it's been very useful when someone gets a low battery. They're surprised at the speed at which this charges their device. The first question - &#34;Where did you get this?&#34;, followed by, &#34;How much did it cost you?&#34;. Usually within a week, they've got one of their own."
"I have an iPhone 6 Plus - I love this mount. It's VERY solid. Seems to stick well (tho I have not had it through a summer in Georgia yet) - I have it mounted in a Toyota 4-Runner on a plastic vertical surface. Extremely adjustable. Hardly shakes at all during movement (they're all going to shake some). I do not have a case on my phone - it grips it well and without damaging the phone. Has soft rubber-ish contact parts. When I set the phone into the mount, it automatically grabs it and can be removed with one hand. I highly recommend this mount. (Oh, in case you're wondering, the &#34;foot&#34; it rests on slides right and left, so you can position it where you can still plug in your power or headphones). I'm actually thinking of buying one for my office desk."
"Arrived on time, fits perfect and looks nice but looks to be engineered for the look Rather than protect."
It is a good case but I didn't really like it. For one the case is too big. Second I don't like the clip I thought it was cool when I saw it but it just look crazy on me and third the built in case you have to buy separately. Don't get me wrong it's a good case it will protect your phone but it's just not for me had to return it's to big.
"It's a great case all in all, but I don't like that you have to take the case off to use the volume off switch..."
"for the price they are great.  They stop working after a couple months, but I buy more.  With 3 kids I loose them usually before they stop working"
"Great replacement head unit for your factory stereo. Connects Bluetooth to Apple and Android with the options of aux and USB inputs. Doesn't work with Windows mobile but its not a problem for me, just putting it out there. You can still connect to the aux port."
"It fits perfectly, excellent purchase."
"The case is very difficult to get off the phone and cause my phone to go flying out of it when I tried to remove the case, causing me to drop and break parts of my phone. Love the case but the lock for the lighter will not stay latched either"
"Awesome look! Hang these around your neck as long as your phone is near you never have to pick your phone up,  just push the button on the earphones. Clarity is crystal clear!"
"[[VIDEOID:57a84e2a3e8a6fd0ed22eb92157a6ddd]] I have a lot of 3- and 6-feet microUSB cables, but this is my only short cable.  And surprisingly, I use it more than the other cables now.  Having less length helps avoid tangles and enables for easy plugging.  In my video review, I show exactly how this cable looks and works.  For more details, see the video.  If this video was helpful, please click on 'yes' below.  Happy shopping!"
"This product is garbage. The first one I bought, lasted 2 months.  I thought maybe it was a random fluke.  So I bought another one. It lasted 7 days. 7 days! Both cords worked fine the day before. Then suddenly they wouldn't charge my iPhone or iPad. Don't waste your money."
"Product came as shown, good value for the price."
I was surprised how well these earbuds sound clarity is good and so is the bass.
Product exactly as described/pictured. Great quality for the cost.
Usb3.0 works great. Easy storage. Fits in messenger bag pocket.
"I am very happy with this purchase. the phone fits great (I have the regular, not the ballistic Turbo) and is secure, so it won't fall out. It feels well protected. I love the kickstand feature. my phone is my alarm clock so it is a nice bonus to have it sit up and hit the snooze that way. For the side buttons for power/volume, they work great. I actually think it is easier to use than the buttons without the case. And I have to love the price. If it isn't the best case out there, it is for sure the best value.<br /><br />The only con I can see is the plastic is a little cheaper grade than I would like. I am still confident in the case, but the plastic quality is lower than I would expect. There is a chance it may crack after a year or so. And if it does, this case is still a steal. but because of the plastic I gave it 4 instead of 5. But even if this case only last a year, I would buy this one again. And I may be just nitpicking and this case will outlive several years.<br /><br />If you got the turbo, this is your best value for a case here"
Product arrived on time and has surpassed expectations<br />I work outside and in the weather and it has been flawless
As advertised. Love the look and doesn't add any weight. Looks even better with one of their back cover skins.
"Very interesting item. It took awhile for me to focus but once I did, it worked.  I purchased at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Great Case at Great Value.. thank you SupCase :)
"FINALLY, a Qi charger that charges my Nexus 6 in its case. No fuss, no placement hassles of looking for the sweet spot. Put the phone on the stand and you're in business. (This was the fourth Qi charger I tried.)"
So pretty.  Just enough bling.  Fits great and so far no one is saying they can't hear me while we're talking.
"When it comes to electronics, I have always gone with this motto: &#34;The more you invest, the longer you'll have it.&#34; So naturally when buying earphones, I figured instead of buying the cheap $5 ones, I'll go ahead and spend a little bit more. I mean, I paid $25 for these and that is a little up there for earphones. Everyone I know buy the $10 ones from Walmart. This is the first time I have regretted following my motto. I ordered the black ones when it read &#34;still in stock,&#34; and then three weeks later they said they only had the silver/white ones and asked if they could just ship me those instead. I replied with &#34;Okay, I would rather have white earphones as opposed to none.&#34; They sent them to me and I received them the next week. The plastic baggie they came in had been opened, but they looked clean and unused so I gave them a try. Not even two months later, they are just dirty (they are dirt magnets) and the microphone doesn't even work. Further more, the &#34;noise-cancelling&#34; earbud set that comes with them are EXTREMELY uncomfortable and aren't even effective. My sister was on her side of the bedroom and she could hear my music even at the recommended volume. Remember when I said I didn't want to buy cheap $5 earphones earlier in this review? Well, like I said, I paid $25 for these and I received earphones with $5 quality anyway. I might as well have saved myself $20.00 and bought the cheap $5 earphones!!!"
"Works well. Be careful about over tightened the screw as it can open the deck out especially on aftermarket decks where the deck may not be in perfectly with the car dashboard. Ball joint is perfect to get the right angle. Magnetic snap on and off is very convenient and much better than other phone holders I tried. Lets me have the phone in portrait and landscape mode, the placement of the phone in the middle of the car is great as well. I will definitely recommend to anyone."
Keeps my family safe from a lot of storms in my area along with giving me a weather report! Have to keep it on the charger to ensure usage after storms.
Charger can't be plugged all the way in or it will stop charging. Seems to be a bad connection in the foldable plug.
"Cards cannot go in slot ,too small.  When phone is inside,  item will not close .  Material is good it is design that is problem.  Wireless charging still works."
"It would of been nice if it had ID slots on the left hand side for you to put your cards in . I bought  it thinking it had , but it didn't .  I like the magnetic closing ."
This unit is more powerful  than most others for its weight and size.  A great deal.
I love it when it works. Finally switched to another brand after my second one broke. Love that it cannot be seen. Love that it fits in my ear nice and tight even when working out hard. The range and battery are pretty good. The down side is that it is much too delicate. Breaks at the seams where you twist it to turn it on and the top most seam where the volume button is. Great concept. Needs major work to get it right. Will buy again with improvements guaranteed.
"Nice, love big cord. But ring around phone-end connector came out of cord housing within a week. It still works, but difficult to disconnect."
"This Athletik Sports Armband fits the iPhone 4, 5, and 6.  It is constructed of premium materials and has slip free flexibility.  Armbands are great when running, working around the house, working out, camping, biking, just any time that you want to keep up with your phone and don't have pockets and don't want to carry it around, constantly picking it up and putting it down and forgetting where you placed it.<br /><br />It has two additional pockets, the front one for your keys and the back one for card, cash, key cards, etc.  It has full touchscreen support, equipped with scratch resistance plastic cover to protect your smartphone while still making it very usable.  It also has top and bottom ports for earphones so that makes your activities more fun.  You can listen to your favorite music while you work.<br /><br />The Sports Armband by Athletik has all the features that you are looking for, and is adjustable for small arms to large ones.  It is made with quality Lycra and Velcro.  It's not going to slip and it gives you freedom.<br /><br />This armband is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  I like the feel of it.  It's not heavy, doesn't slip and it's easy to use, putting it on and taking it off.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and is based solely on my experience with the product."
best cord I own hands down! I replaced my phone and ipod cord with this type of cord. long lasting too doesn't rip at top where most cords do
Could not be happier. The repeater at Scout Camp was down and these antennas work so that we didn't need to fix the repeater the whole Camp session
DOESNT WORK AT ALL! I ordered this for my iPod shuffle as the other cord is on its last leg - this wouldn't charge when plugged into the wall and wouldn't connect OR charge when plugged into my computer. DO NO PURCHASE THIS!
"Over the years I have owned many different blue tooth headsets.  This was, by far, the best I've ever owned.  When my H720 got lost, I was heartsick.  I tried 4 other brands, but none of them offered the comfort and overall performance of the H720.  I am back to buy another one, and wish I'd not wasted so much time and money on other brands.<br />I tried Plantronics, Jabra, and LG and my friends complained of &#34;background noise&#34; with all of them!  That NEVER happened with my H720.  So, I've finally wised up....a year or so and lots of wasted dollars later.  I recommend this headset to anyone!"
you get what you pay for on this one. Looks wise the case was great but the quality leaves something to be desired but then you get what you pay for
"Amazing case - very clear, very slim, very protective. Excellent value, look and feel, quality."
Arrived earlier than expected! Easy to assemble and looks great!
Perfect case for the ultra. Can't beat it. Super thin and great price
"This is an incredibly handy device. As a teenager that goes on many school trips, It's amazing to pass around the Audio cord and have the driver pop up anybody's music on the radio. Or if you simply don't have an AUX in on your car radio, this is your next best option!"
"This is an exceptional power bank. I'm impressed, and I want to help other consider a few things if they're thinking about making a purchase.<br /><br />Charging/Function: 5/5<br />-This charges my various devices quickly and efficiently. I plugged in both my phone and my kindle fire at the same time, and they charged with no problem. It's also great that there are two charging ports.<br />-The power bank keeps its charge for a long time.<br />-This came with almost a full charge out of the box (score!)<br />-It does take quite awhile to recharge the unit when it's empty/dead, so you'll want to plan ahead.<br /><br />Design/Convenience: 5/5<br />-This is a beautiful and clean looking unit that came in high quality protective packaging<br />-It's about the same size as my Samsung Galaxy S5, which makes it very convenient to stack these two in my purse to charge my phone while I'm out and about (see photo).<br />-I was worried that this would get hot, because it's all enclosed in plastic. No need to fear! My phone actually gets hotter than the power bank while it's charging.<br /><br />Bonus:<br />-My power bank came with easy to read directions and a link to join the company's VIP program, where new products can be purchased at a discount. I'm not sure how long this promotion will last, but it's a great bonus for an already smart purchase.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in order to test it and share my honest opinion, so I've tried to use this item extensively and address some potential questions and concerns here. I will update this review if my assessment of this product changes after a more prolonged period of use."
"The product was as described, it arrived very quickly, but many people I talk to you the phone can't hear me very well.  It is possible that the case somehow blocks the speaker slightly to cause this problem.  I am pleased as to the quality with that exception."
"Does the job, i.e. good protection, while remaining light and very thin. I just wish the material would let the color of the phone pass through some more."
"Upgraded from a G3 (not from Amazon, sorry - went to the local Blue Box store)<br /><br />It's a good phone - makes & receives phone calls extremely well - depending on signal strength.<br />  Camera is awesome<br />  You can add an SD card for additional storage<br />  You can change the battery (I recommend getting one from LG with the charger for it)<br />  Music sounds good<br /><br />Cons<br />  Seems to limited to Google browsing. I tried a couple others, including my favorite Firefox & they just seem to bog down.<br />  The leather back looks cool, but when I have it on, my soft case doesn't stay on very well. I drop things - need that baby buggy bumper.<br /><br />Big Con - What engineer decided to put the on/off button in the middle of the volume up/down buttons? Am I the only one who goes to raise the volume on a song & puts my phone to sleep?  Or, in the process of turning the phone &#34;on/off&#34; during a day, eventually turns the volume down so low, I miss the &#34;important&#34; call from my wife?<br /><br />Lately - trying to put the phone to sleep with the on/off button takes a screenshot ?????<br /><br />Come on LG - get some engineer who have to live with fat fingers like the rest of us."
"Update: Anker's stellar customer service contacted me and sent out another cable that has been working great for a week now! As a result, I've bumped up my review to 4 stars since I now have a working cable - but would've preferred to have a working cable to begin with (not a month later).<br /><br />I've been using it for only about a month or two, and the tip of the micro-usb side is already bent/broken, and doesn't work properly all the time anymore. Sometimes it's charging, other times it's not charging unless I fiddle with it.<br /><br />I'm very careful with my electronics, and have never done anything to cause excess strain on the cable - especially not bent or yanked the cable out in unnatural angles. I've bought many microusb cables, and some have frayed and whatnot - but I've never had one with such a cheap tip that bends off so easily."
"I have phone chargers all over the place. I keep a phone charger anywhere I know I'm going to be, and the same goes for hubby and the grand-kids."
"Great phone, has the old key board that I just love and larger screen.  Still need to get a little bit used to the new features, but this is almost necessary upgrade for bb users!"
The phone is crap can't even turn on when you first set it up. Don't know why they still sell it
"I really liked the wire tool, i hadn't thought to use something like that before. The glass is plenty firm. Might help if it said which side of glass was front but it doesn't take much effort to flip it a second time without the glue/gel sticking to the glass... my bad on that part haha."
"Thought I'd use this adapter to switch between my iphone 5s and my Oneplus One device. Big problem since first of all this adapter has this little piece of adhesive on it which is not particularly strong. So once I inserted it properly onto the micro-sim tray slot for my Oneplus one, it first of all did not read the sim card at all. When I tried to eject it, the sim card tray ejected with the actual sim card (with a nasty scratch on it), but the sim card adapter was left stuck in the phone. I took it to a repair shop and they told me that my Oneplus device is now inoperable as a phone thanks to the sim card adapter basically shredding all of the sim-card reading pins on the Oneplus mainboard. So now I'm left with a phone that'd be too expensive to repair, an adapter that doesn't work, and needing to get a replacement sim.<br /><br />Lesson learned is, DO NOT use this sim card adapter if you have a Oneplus One phone. And considering the repair shop I took it to said that he's seen this happen many times for other people, I would avoid using adapters at all if you can."
"Edit: September 4, 2015  After receiving a glitchy cable that didn't work properly, I posted a one-star review (included below) detailing my problems and concerns with the cord. To my surprise, a representative from Anker emailed me the next day. She apologized and offered to replace it free of charge. The new cable was quickly delivered only a couple of days later, and to my surprise, it works as well as my official Apple Lightning to USB cables. Not only am I very happy with the new cable, I am even happier with Anker's prompt response in fixing the problem. After this experience, I would definitely order from them again. If there is an issue with their product's quality, they seem quick to fix the problem. Great customer service!  Original: August 30, 2015  After reading all the positive reviews, I had high expectations for this cable. Unfortunately, this cord or its connections are glitchy. Initially, it wouldn't charge or sync at all, but after some play, I finally got it to work. However, the cable will still only charge/sync when held up at a certain angle. If the cable is disturbed or falls out of the right &#34;place,&#34; it stops charging. You have to keep a constant eye on it. Yesterday, it took nearly a half a day to charge my iPhone because it kept quit charging at random."
Best phone case I've ever come across. It's so durable biut lightweight. Extremely easy to handle. I'm very pleased with this phone case. I'm thinking about ordering more in different colors.
"Having purchased many 3rd party lightning cables in the past, I thought this cable would be the same. Most 3rd party cables don't work with both sides; they will only work with one side. However, this cable worked both ways and I was genuinely surprised. The charging speed matches that of the OEM cable and syncing works just as well.<br /><br />The build is really well built and looks almost identical to the OEM cable. The only difference I could find is the RAVPower logo on the cable. This cable is a bit shorter than the original cable but I find that actually works in my case because it reduces clutter on my desk. I recommend this cable to anyone who needs another spare cable, car cable, or if your OEM cable has broke. It is a lot cheaper than buying an original cable from apple and it works just as well if not better.<br /><br />Cable was provided for review by RAVPower"
"So I am pleased with the RAVPower products. I have a solar power panel, and large back up battery, and I have three of these car charges. I am all about RAVPower as much as I am with the Jackery's. None of them have failed me.<br /><br />Every now and then I do have an issue with it charging my Iphone 6 with an OtterBox resurgence, but the mild issues to not match up with the happiness I have with RVAPower. If you do not need more power or an ismart plug, then this is for you. As for me I have found that I need to have that extra juice."
"The device is size convenient but does not work as I expected, sometimes it fully charges my iPhone but sometimes it charges only like 45% of the battery"
I would recommend this protector. I previously had another glass protector that did it's job and cracked when I dropped absorbing shock so my actual screen didn't crack. This one seems better than the first one I had.
The jambox is great. The sound is better than expected and the device is extremely easy to set up and use with my iPhone. I was however disappointed when I saw it advertised for much less from kohl's.
"The rubber coating on the case make it difficult to get the phone in and out of the holster. The stand on the case will only allow the phone to be propped up horizontally, not vertically. I have ordered a new case."
Just what I wanted.  Quality is Great.  Would buy again
This was clearly a magpul fake.. Had I known it was coming straight from China I would not have wasted my money
"Great So Far. Snugg Fit, Stays Fit."
"We have an older Sound Dock that has the old style iDevice connector. We had stopped using it because we didn't have any working devices that had that connector anymore. Luckily, I was able to find this Bluetooth adapter. It works well, has pretty decent range, and sounds good (a bit bass heavy, but very clear). My only complaint is that it seems that the only way to &#34;wake&#34; the adapter is to unplug it and plug it back in. That's a minor issue, though."
Great case. Slick and protects  my phone.  Only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because if the air bubbles created in the back seethru side. None the less the best case ive purchased for the s6 (tried 4 already)
The  Anker charger  is the  BEST!  CHARGE  cell phone and ecig very Fast<br /> 4 electronic devices all the same time<br />Buy it!
"Great price, looked like it would be awesome protection in the water. Unfortunately it went missing before I was able to actually use the product 😥"
This was for my granddaughter's phone and she is very pleased. It fits perfectly
"Got a great price &#60;$20, sound is about average, comparable to my LG Tone.  Mic is poor because it is in the earpiece.  You need to remove the earpiece and put it up to your mouth.  Because of the small size, they should be magnetic so as to not have them fall off and get lost."
It's the first case to prevent my teenager from breaking her phone.  And she hasn't gone a year without breaking one prior to this case.
"I love my Ranboo I use it everyday when I go walking, shopping. It's just the right size for your everyday basic needs. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
Great sound and beats my other cassette adapter. I like that the cord is stretchable instead of a straight cord because it takes up less space and doesn't get hooked up in things.
Brought this phone for my daughter she loves it works great compact and cute pink color.
This case was great it is made with quality and definitely worth the price
This battery serves the purpose of powering the LG Env3.  The battery is a little bigger than the phone so it doesn't fit flush against the back.
"I just love the selfie stick! used it for the first time yesterday during my son's baby shower,  and it worked wonderfully. I actually Set it  up and took good group pictures and elevated pictures was very very easy"
"This charging station has made my desk so organized. I highly recommend this product, it looks great and takes care of loose random wires while keeping my toys in one place."
"Love the case but as others commented earlier you have to modify the charger port access with a dremel. But its the only case i could find that had everything i wanted, mainly a screen protector, i an very satisfied with the case and will buy another if this one ever breaks. Oh yeah ive been using it for over a year now in very condition imaginable."
my fourth E980 phone. love. not a replacement i just have four.
"It is capable of charging IPhones, iPads, Androids, GPS devices as well as cameras and this even works on my Windows phone.."
"Great product, dependable protection for your valuable electronics."
"I purchased and it cracked when I dropped phone Tech Armor sent out a replacement. No problems, I recommend their product and customer service folks. They sent a replacement glass, I was driving on my motorcycle today and my I phone 6 fell out of the holder at 60 mph. The phone landed on the the Tech Armor glass, it shattered, but it protected my phone. I removed the armor glass and the phone does not have a scratch. I would never expected this, but it worked. I am happy."
"Works well to make sure I can charge my cellphone while at work. Definitely would recommend to a friend traveling or who is prone to use up their cell phone charge quickly. After the main work day ends (6 hours on my feet), I sit down for the desk part of my work; I'll plug this battery into my phone and recharge it to maximum while I type at the computer. This routine repeats for five days until the weekend, when I recharge the external battery.  I think it could last more days without a recharge but I like to be sure."
"I bought 3 of these cables, to have one for home, office and car.  Two of the 3 have stopped working, and are no longer able to charge my iphone.  They worked for a few months, then died.  There is no apparent damage on outside of the cable, so i don't think it is dead to abuse.  They just stop working from normal wear and tear after a few months."
"A great GPS with accurate maps, easy to read to display and loud speaker for good audible descriptions of what route or changes to make make to said route."
"mouth guard was purchased for my grandson. he was very much impressed with it. the charger even though i haven't tested it yet, i feel will help me in my travels."
Another quality Anker product. I've used their stuff for a couple years and it is well-made and works great.
"Good value. However some dirt etc can get in where the home button is, so I had to put a piece of clear tape over it. Looks kind of janky"
It works but I can never seem to get all the bubbles out no matter what I try. It's only a few. It works though. It's a great deal for the price.
Would not connect/sync with my phone or computer.  May have been a defective device.  Replacement is being sent today.  Hopefully this one will work.
A great deal for the price.  Same quality as the single stylus at the same price.
"I've only been using this device for a few days but I'm very pleased with it. It works perfectly on my Note 4 (with a qi receiver). It's very simple to use, basically just plug the adapter to device and then plug in to the wall. You don't have to figure out the sweet spot, just rest your phone on the charger. I highly recommend purchasing this AND it charges with my caseology phone case on.."
"The product is just awesome. Shipping and packing were good from the seller's side. The quality of the sound is amazing(perfect mids, lows and bass aswell), it sounds like a high quality branded earphones for the price it is offered. Taking phone calls is a breeze, the call quality through the earphones and the clarity of the microphone is pretty good. It shows the battery bar on IOS (did not try on android). It connects to my PC very well, the Bluetooth connection is strong on both PC and the iPhone. The buttons on the earphones are highly helpful to turn on, turn off, pairing, amswering calls or disconnecting calls, volume +, volume -, changing tracks .............. all of them work really good. I am very much satisfied with the product. CHEERS"
Not happy with case or company it came from. Case did not  cover phone for good coverage. And it took me 6 emails to get my refund back. Will not order again
"I plan to give this as a Christmas gift or hopefully to give away to someone who still owns a note 4, it is way too small for galaxy note 5"
Perfect and cane really fast
Excellent case! Really helps on battery life for my iPhone.
"Love it! It's soft so it doesn't scratch or damage my watch, plus it hides most of the cord inside the bowl. Would definitely recommend this product."
"It fits the little nokia phone looks colorful and everything else but the rubber is more like some sort of hard flexy plastic more so then a silicone or rubber shock absorbing case like I am used to with other cases.  It's cheap for a reason, I still use it on my work phone, but its more of a pain in the butt then anything else really and the buttons are super stiff and hard to push to make them activate the phone buttons on the side when in the case."
"After reading other reviews I didn't want to invest my 7.00, but thought I would take a chance, I liked the brown leather look. But to my surprise I really like it, will buy again if need be. So far I have no complaints really glad I bought it."
"Arrived & packaged as expected.  A co-worker suggested I check out OtterBox, and it is a good product.  I'm satisfied."
"I was skeptical when I ordered this, but I found that it was easy to assemble and works well.  The magnet for the nfc switch works well and  the lenses that are included worked fine for me.  The phone is held in place by a rubber band and its held very securely.  The head band holds it into place nicely without being to tight for my average size head.  This is a nice way to try out VR and this technology will only get better, my kids were amazed at how they could look all around and interact with things in some programs.  There are many programs to chose from in the google play store and apple store to try.  I recommend it."
Works great! I love this phone holder.<br />This phone holder will securely fasten into your car vent.<br />I have a iPhone 5s with case and It fits perfectly!<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
The radio scanner works very well and I am enjoying it. The only draw back is the Battery life is a little short it only last about 4-5 hours other devices  similar  in  nature last about 8-10 hours. I am a retired Firefighter with 55 years experience and I like to listen to what is going on with my old friends and co workers.
"The item as promised, very fast shipping...a great case for the money...Just what I was looking for...Great price..."
pin pictured is not the correct pen.  It did not work on my device.  I had one like photoed and it worked.
Great product.  Only way to protect your smartphones screen.  This item fit my LG G4 perfectly.
"It's a great case for the money!  To help other consumers, the color is more coral than pink and the case itself is a little slippery (for lack of a better explanation).  Never that less, I am very satisfied."
"arrived on time,  fits perfect."
"I tried my Galaxy S4 in partial sun (cloudy) today. Started at 91%. Went out to check it 20 minutes later and was at 100%. I was happy about that. The reason I only gave it 4 stars, is Amazon and the companies advertising on Amazon shows 2.4 amps output for each USB port, but the manual that came with it reads 2.1 amps output for each port. I specifically purchased this unit for the higher capacity current capability.<br />Can XDragon chime in on this?<br /><br />I will be glad to receive my USB Detector to test it in full sun."
Perfect...it fits snug around my phone and does a great job protecting it...the little kickstand is an added bonus.  Worth the money...would purchase it again.<br />Thanks!
"This device performs well, however sometimes during a call the audio is not crystal clear, I am aware that this could be caused by factors external to the device like cell phone signal strength. The multifunction buttons are always a problem for me. I would prefer a button for each function"
"This comes with a life time warranty and I had to replace it once. Velcro tears and comes loose.i bought two more because my phone wouldn't fit in any other carrier. Just expected it to be more durable, but for the price it is ok."
I have ordered 2x and it's perfect for front pocket phone carriers and when It goes in My purse nothing sticks to the screen it's well covered.  I'm prone to drop my phones and I don't worry with this case. Although I prefer the black. I ordered green which was available that day..

Good glass amazing deal I love it
I should have read the other reviews more carefully. This is one of the Spigen cases that scratches the frame. I only had my phone in the case for 4 days and when I removed it the the top and sides of the metal frame were scratched. There is nothing I can really do about it at this point so I just returned the case and bought something else. I don't know how this case is still allowed to be sold after so many complaints.
Hi purchase one and had to return it because one of the headset when out I got the replacement when using my cell phone the sound goes in and out not too happy with this product
"If you are going to buy this for your ttc amaze please don't buy it. But otherwise you can purchase it. I put this battery into my HTC amaze and then it just started giving problems. However, the seller is good, they communicated well with me and help me solve the issue. Thanks"
"Breaks too easily,will never buy again. Looks cool but old drop and the wood stripes away in long chips"
"I lost my Jawbone after only two wearings. I was so upset that I came home and wrote to the company.<br />I was amazed how quickly they responded  to my email.<br />Jawbone then followed up with numerous emails in order to send me a replacement Jawbone!!<br />I received my new Jawbone within 10 days of losing the first one due to the band clasp coming apart.<br />I have been using the clip on Jawbone daily.<br />I am an ice skater, primarily an ice dancer with a lot of footwork involved.<br />Im not sure how accurate the Jawbone is, but I will continue to use this to monitor my exercise.<br />Have you had other inquire about the accuracy of its use with ice skating?"
LOVE THAT MY PHONE LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL AND THE COVER IS LIGHT WEIGHT.  MAKES HOLDING THE PHONE COMFORTABLE.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN 'STYLE'
Order this case for my daughter's iphone 4. It's about a inch to big. In the discription of the it clearly says it's for a iphone 4.
The fabric was too stretchy and the cards kept falling out of holder. I only kept it on my phone for a little longer than a week. I don't recommend this product.
I purchased this charger to take with me on vacation recently and it failed me completely.  After using this product less than three times it just stopped working completely.
Worked for my Google Tablet (2013) version.  Guys at best buy wanted $200 to fix the usb port but this pad allowed me to charge the tablet and cost so much less.  Thanks.
"OK. . So after trying 3 other protective covers, this is the only one which fits the Note 4 precisely. The holes in the  cover line up with the ports on the phone. It doesn't add any weight to the phone. This cover has enough 'lip' around the sreen to protect it when posed face down on a smooth surface. It is sturdy and thick enough to protect the phone when it drops to the floor. I am totally happy with this protection time cover"
"Nice looking case, it seems to have the essentials for protection against ballistic mishaps. I have yet to test its actual effectiveness (and I hope I never do)."
This item was exactly as described.  Price was best I could find.  Shipping was quicker than expected.
"Hello,I bay so many things from Amazon and I never had problem until now,I revive my Samsung 6 edge yesterday but my camera is not working proper,can not focus.<br />I read  so many reviews but I can t fix the problem,do I have to replace the phone or I m missing some ting so I can fix issue by my self .<br />Thank you."
Great product fits good<br />Thank you!
Love the cover but wish picture was clearer as it is a blurred pic.
"Had for over a year.  Yesterday on I-94 in Detroit I was doing about 80 miles per hour and a bug feel on my phone.  I held the phone up to see if the wind would blow it off and the wind caught my phone with so much force that it went flying out the window at 80 miles per hour on the freeway.  My phone was not damaged but he case was a little scraped.  My wife told my in-laws that I usually pay a lot of money for a good case to protect me phone so she's not surprised.  :)<br /><br />I can't believe my screen wasn't cracked or anything after this thing bounced off the pavement or even another car at 80 MPH.  Attached are the photos.<br /><br />The screen got a little damaged, and Seido was great about replacing it.  I tested it in water and it didn't get any water in it.  Only complaint I had is that people have a hard time hearing me on speaker phone with the case on - so I have to hold my phone to my head or use a Bluetooth headset."
This case is amazing! It has everything they said it would and works perfectly. The tempered glass is really easy to put on and even has a kit to clean your phone before you put it on.<br />The only thing I didnt like was that I was thinking that it came with a camera hood but I even stuck my finger through were the camera is and still nothing to enhance your photos. But other than that the case is flawless
"Having tested one of BLU's earlier (Studio) cellphone models, I was curious to see how this new model fared. I can honestly say that this phone does not disappoint.<br /><br />Unlike the previous BLU model I tested, the Energy X model has a very solid feel to it. Part of that seems to be due to an improved case that uses a higher grade of plastic. Part is due to a heavier, longer-lasting 4,000 mAh internal battery. Combine that with an even larger 5.5&#34; screen and you have all the ingredients for a phone that looks, feels and operates far beyond any expectations one should have for a cellphone that sells for well under $200.<br /><br />On the plus side, this model's expansive 5.5&#34; display is bright, crisp and very highly responsive. It's quad core processor gives it more than enough juice to stream both audio and video. Resolution-wise, you will not get the same quality picture as an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, but it is quite adequate for viewing the usual content you would normally be watching on a 5.5&#34; screen.<br /><br />The phone's battery performance is great on standby, but drains a bit faster than other phones I have used when running applications. I suspect that the phone's ultra-bright, oversized screen is the main culprit when it comes to battery drain. Fortunately, the phone's internal battery charges up to 4,000 mAh, so you can go longer without recharging than with most phones. The phone's plain-vanilla Android OS is a joy to set up as compared to most phones. You will not find any of the bloatware common to phones you will get directly from your carrier, or even direct from most manufacturers like Samsung. No features are blocked or locked, that includes the ability to tether or operate your phone as a  portable wi-fi hotspot.<br /><br />With all that said, there are obviously some shortcomings with a phone this inexpensive. These mostly fall under the category of &#34;frills&#34; as far as I am concerned, but they may be more important to you. The most obvious shortcoming of this phone is its camera. If you want to record HD video or take high-resolution pictures, this is definitely not the phone for you. It's 8 MP front-facing camera operates slowly and produces sub-par pictures as compared to most modern smartphones. So, don't get your hopes up when it comes to taking pictures.<br /><br />The second most obvious shortcoming is the phone's memory, or lack thereof. 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM don't go a long way if you run a lot of memory intensive apps on your phone. You can add up to 64GB of memory using a micro SD card, but SD cards operate at slower speeds than RAM, so choose your apps (and where you store them) carefully. If you do add a micro SD card for extra memory, be sure to buy a Class 10 card. They may run you a few dollars more, but they seem to run much faster and more reliable than the cheaper Class 4 cards.<br /><br />Another oddball &#34;feature&#34; is the phone's use of removable &#34;cartridges&#34; to store both the micro SD card and the SIM (actually, SIMS, since it holds up to two SIM cards). The phone comes with a tiny &#34;key&#34; you need to use to insert or remove the memory or SIM. You could just as easily use a paperclip, but the fact that these tiny cartridges could become so easily lost or broken while swapping memory or SIM cards is a bit worrisome. If you are the type of person who almost never accesses the SIM or SD card, this should not be an issue. If you swap these frequently, I would stay away from this model though.<br /><br />The last downside I will mention is the phone's battery. While it has great battery life, the inability to swap batteries or quick-charge is a bit of a disappointment. I think that BLU went the wrong direction in making the battery non-swappable, but I'm guessing that accounts for how they kept the price of the phone so low.<br /><br />Altogether, this is an impressive looking phone with an easy to read screen, tons of features and plenty of battery life. While it does not measure up to an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy when it comes to specs, what you do get for the price is pretty awesome. With an unlocked GSM smartphone with dual SIMS, quad core processor and 5.5&#34; display for under $200 you can hardly go wrong.nd plenty of battery life. While it does not measure up to an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy when it comes to specs, what you do get for the price is pretty awesome.

"My 6Plus was left on the roof of my truck, it well off, was run over at least twice, and this case saved it! Love It! had it for about a year, never with out my business cards. Incredible."
"I bought this QI charger for my HTC, I was a little worried about the overheat problem, and used it for one week and the result turns out great, the overheat problem do not exist."
Very pleased with this product. Practically installed itself without any bubbles.  The feel is natural without loss of touch sensitivity.  Will be searching for this product for other installations.
"I bought this for my hubby's birthday. He recently purchased a Subaru WRX STI, and I figured the $70 would be a lot better spent on a radar detector than on speeding tickets lol! It works fantastically after he got it positioned properly on his dash, and is easy to read and  hear. Once you get used to it, you don't even have to look at the detector anymore, because you can determine what alert it is by the sound out the beeps"
It is a good quality protector and fits perfectly on iPhone plus.<br />Price is affordable as well.  I will buy it again.
"As others had mentioned, the suction cup REALLY SUCKS! (In a good way, of course!) It holds on tight! My problem, however, is that the screw-cap thingy that attaches the camera to the suction cup holder has cracked. That means I can no longer tighten the camera in place. Just that one little piece...and there's really no way to order another piece. :-(  I am planning to try duct tape or electrical tape to see if I can get it stabilized, but otherwise, I'd have to purchase a whole new camera just because of the one piece cracking. Bummer."
Great sound quality and comfy.  Also has a good battery life. I would Def recommend to anyone.
Fixed the ground hum when connecting an ACC100 FM radio transmitter to a mixer. Simple solution to a nightmare problem.
This an amazing case! Best iPhone case out there. You can't beat the price and this case is much better then another life proof case because this case actually works I just love it!!!
Works good. Does not hold charge for as long as it should. Great for the price point.
"DO NOT BUY.<br />I'll try to be short.<br />Was biking, had phone and key in arm band.<br />Velcro is terrible, comes loose while biking.<br />Key falls somewhere in the woods.<br />Samsung falls and front facing camera breaks.<br />Think about all of the injustices in the world.<br /><br />IXCC, IF YOU GO BANKRUPT AND NEVER SELL ANYTHING AGAIN IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO PAY ME FOR THIS INJUSTICE."
"The case looks and feels decent, but DO NOT buy this case if you are strictly looking for protection. I dropped my LG G4 from waist height onto the wooden staircase i was walking up and the tempered glass screen protector i had on it SHATTERED. I am so glad that i had a screen protector on it, but just realize that this case is not the best when it comes to protection. Also, the plastic band on the bottom of the phone broke off so now theres a piece of plastic just hanging off and its really frustrating.q"
These chargers didn't last a month. They stopped working.  Very poor quality.
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.<br /><br />update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool."
"Awsome fit, and great feel."
I've had these for several months now. They are still working great. I've bought alot of cheap ones that usually stop working after a couple of weeks. I have a feeling these will last awhile. My only complaint is that the platic head that surrounds the tip that plugs into the iphone is big so it may not work with some screen protectors.
Awesome product!! I put on my dashboard weeks ago and it has not moved an inch! It stays in place and I used it as a cell phone holder I can stop suddenly as well as go over bumps and my phone does not move at all. Great product for those who are always using their phone or needing it while in the car and can never find it with this product you put it there and it's always in the right place!! I received this I. Exchange for review great product!!
"Crap product, I took my brand new phone out of the box, never touched the screen, cleaned with enclosed wet cloth then with enclosed micro fiber cloth, and it still won't stick in upper and lower right corners no matter how much I press on it ."
"Well....I've had almost all of them, tempered glass, Zagg hd wet install...etc. I ended up buying this because I had it briefly on my gs6 and it looked great. I have an iPhone 6 now and was hesitant because of the 3 star rating. I usually don't write reviews but thought this screen protector deserved better than 3 stars. EVERY other screen protector I purchased for this phone had issues, halo, bubbles etc. With this protector if you follow the instructions it works perfectly. No bubbles, no halo, easy install, can barely tell it's there. It won't protect from impact, but that's not what I'm looking for, scratch protection suits me fine. You can't go wrong with this protector for the price, and proper install."
"Have had this mount for two weeks now and up until today I would have given it four stars.<br />However, riding on the new England roads presents challenges and gear has to hold up. This morning I hit a pot hole that nearly knocked me off my bike, the pothole did, however, knock the mount off my bike with the phone. Given the severity of the hit, I thought for sure my phone was done let alone having any chance of the mount holding up. Well to my surprise, the phone did not have a scratch , dent, or other mark from the incident. The backing of the mount had a few scrapes but otherwise intact. Not only was it intact but I was able to use the mount once I had rebooted my phone. I'm sold on this device."
"This is super handy. Works well and keeps out phone right in place. Be careful with the manner though, it put a pretty heavy scratch on the back of my iPhone."
Effective but a little pricy.
Stitching on Velcro coming undone less than 30 days into purchase. Just general application of on and off. Easy to restitch however that should not have happened
"Cheap & it works. The only down side is that it only works plugged in on one side to your phone, whereas the original lightning cable from Apple will work no matter which side you plug into your phone."
I love this Galaxy S6 Edge slim case. I like how it snaps on the back easily. It fits great and is lightweight and not bulky. I like the burgundy color I picked out and they way it looks and fees is great. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
"didn't work, bad buy."
"Having recently learned about the negative effects of &#34;blue light&#34; - I bought these for me and really like them.  I never noticed it until I put this on the phone, just how much blue light is produced.  My eye doctor suggested getting special lenses for me and my kids, and it occurred to me that this would be a much cheaper solution, and it was!"
Built a cooler-stereo with this and it works very well.  It IS waterproof but I did use caulking around it for extra water protection.  Give a good stereo signal though and I would recommend it.  Cheap too.
Handy to hold phone in vents so I don't have to look down just takes a little time to create a special bend that works
Great band for the apple watch sports space grey. Fits perfectly and looks great. One minus point was that it was very hard to resize even qith rhe tools it came with.
"I was disappointed the package arrive past the 26 day window in which I was informed the package would arrive. When I emailed about my concerns, I felt my concerns were not being addressed. Nonetheless, when the product arrived, the case fit but the buttons along the sides that control things like turning the phone off did not align making the case useless. I am frustrated by the entire situation and would recommend not purchasing this product. Spend a few more dollars for one less headache and a product that works as intended."
"STOP LOOKING! I tried 2 other screen replacements and they either didn't work, or was missing cables. This has it all and spare parts. 5 minute job tops if you already have the screen off."
Sucked. They worked great the first time I used them. Plugged them in the next day and didn't work at all!
Great phone case.  Keeps my phone safe from scratches and such.<br />Always getting comments on the cute white dots on red pattern!
"These cables have a tendency to separate where the adapter fits onto the cable itself, though I suppose they aren't much worse than most other cables. I've replaced two of them now, but for the price, I don't mind it much. They're long and they work well, all things considered."
"I was so excited to get this product.  I had just recently purchased an iPhone 5s and was looking for something to carry it in.  When I got this case, I immediately put my phone in it and it fit great.  My phone is nice and snug which is one thing I was concerned about - but not anymore!  The reason I rated this a 4 and not a 5 is because I can tell the case is not great quality.  I think it will do the trick for a few months, but I don't expect it to last longer than that.  But for the price, I can buy another one to replace it!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"The elastic plastic front is subpar. It has the feel and dirt attraction similar to a kids rubberized toy. It probably will keep your phone protected, but I wasn't willing to test it."
Love the phone. Upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. Very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.
"Probably fake. Make sure you aren't duped. Was going to purchase it, read the reviews and decided against it."
"its not sturdy at all.... it did not meet any of my expectations... It's not worth it for me to send back.... so maybe I can find someone that can use it.<br /><br />the design is flawed.... the grip for the mounting area doesn't grab to much, you're limited to what it will grab... and then even if you do find a FLAT surface to get it attached to..... it can easily SLIP off when adjusting the phone or the angle.<br /><br />I'm thinking about taking off the mount it came with and using a much stronger grip from like Hone Depot and modify the mount..... if the mount was more universal and STRONG... then the movement, bouncing up n down of the phone would be lessened.<br /><br />unfortunately, I know there may be a few consumers out there that may not be too Technically inclined enough to modify their own.... and Kudos to those that made this thing work for them.... you must be sitting or standing REALLY STILL right about now."
LOVE this phone wallet case!!  It holds just enough of what I need.  The phone fits securely and the Edge screen is clearly visable.  I like the fact the cards have a separate divider so when using my phone noone can see my cards.  I tend to carry too much and this wallet keeps me to the bare mimimun.  It will close only with a card in each slot and limited cash.  Love the plum color.  May order more!!
"Such a great product! It works so well and now my husband can charge his phone, I can chart my phone and we can charge the family iPad all at the same time on our car trips!"
"These headphones have decent quality sound, and the earbuds are feel comfortable. However, it is difficult to get the ear hooks over the ear and to stay on securely on the ear. They are usable and stay on for the most part, but they occasionally need to be readjusted. The mic works well for phone calls."
"Was really happy with this case - very slim, unobtrusive, and I police the yellow color, but the it broke literally the next day. The thin piece of plastic between the volume controls and the screen snapped overnight. Pretty disappointing. I hadn't expected a cheap case to last too long, but at least 48 hours?"
This is a piece of crap.  Doesn't charge well in the sun and lousy operation...not to mention it is huge and bulky.  I wish I had read reviews on it before purchasing. Do yourself a favor...buy a regular outlet unit that will work.  Love to be environmentally friendly but this is a waste of $$!
"I love it when technology comes together and makes my life so much easier!!! Celtronix was on point with their Multi-Port Quad USB 4 Port Wall Charger! I do own another adapter that is similar to this that I keep at home; this one will be utilized at work amongst my coworkers and I.<br /><br />My coworkers love to see what new gadgets I get and was very pleased to see that I had something for all of us to use!! We are not allowed, well, not supposed to, use the computers at work to charge our phones for fear of viruses and what not. So we no longer have that issue!<br /><br />At work, we literally have one power outlet for all of us to share. I brought this nice Quad USB Wall Charger in and one would have thought we hit the lottery! They were so pleased all 3 of us got to use the wall outlet at the same time with the use of this handy piece of equipment.<br /><br />Prior to using this USB Wall Charger at work, I tested it at home. I made sure to check for warmness or any hot feelings to touch to the USB charge, wall outlet, and cable cords. My findings were a tad bit of warmness. The charger did not over heat nor did I find any problems to my charging cord.<br /><br />We are pleased with this device and have not complaints. It is compact, lightweight, easy to use, store, and travel with.<br /><br />I was chosen to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"I don't believe this hard cover case is for a Apple Touch 1st Gen.  The power switch opening is on the wrong side.  As others stated there is no volume openings on the left side. As far as the strength of the case, I can see where there can be some concerns ( but I have not drop it yet).  The reasons I gave it two stars was the screen is protected some what.  Finally, I do like the clear appearance.  If I could have seen it up close, I would not have purchased this case. I can't recommend this product."
"It works just like an oversized Android phone. I love it! It also has Microsoft Word,  Excel, PowerPoint, etc... I inserted a 64g SanDisk memory card for extra storage.<br /><br />The only issue I had; I ordered a few protective cases and they were the wrong size. The size were for Galaxy Tab 8 which is totally different from the Tab A. The Tab A is much bigger! But it's cool 👌 I love it 💖<br /><br />If you decide to purchase it...enjoy! It's very fast too! Although it doesn't stay connected to the Internet for long periods."
The plastic case frame cracks and breaks easily. I just got mine and used it for a week. I dropped my phone on the carpet and the whole frame cracked and chipped.
"Worked fine for 2 weeks, then bricked.  Got it mainly to help keep track of swimming laps.  Off by close to 100 yards plus or minus any given mile swim. Close enough.  Would eventually have tried the golf and Cycling features.  Now does not work at all. After charging it stuck in update mode all day and now nothing.   Update ... It mysteriously started working again after about 2 months.  Used it the rest of the summer for recording laps and it worked pretty well. also used it for steps and stationary bike a few times.  Now it just stopped recording steps when i walk or distance.  It will show distance as the crow flies from a starting point so basic GPS seems to be working.  It also displays time and date, but that is all. Will NOT connect to Garmin for updates."
"Thought it was a great case, but then the sleep/wake button at the top of of the case broke off. Spigen won't fix or replace even though the case is only 5 months old because I brought it through an authorized retailer (Amazon)."
The armband is fantastic for the Galaxy S4. It's everything one would want in an armband. It's great that there is no plastic screen cover so it's easy to actually use the phone while it's in the skin. They did however include 2 screen protectors with the product which is really cool. I highly recommend it for those who have the S4.
Top of the line. Great investment to protect my phone and looks great at the same time !
"Its working great so far its been a little over a month. few things i dont like are its too bulky, the phone gets EXTREMELY hot when charging, you cant charge with a normal iphone charger. but those are honestly all pretty minor issues the case works great, they raised the price recently which was upsetting i was gonna order another one but not anymore."
"Fantastic case but the only downside is that the side buttons are more equipped for the iPhone 5 not 5c as advertised. I have to push to hard and I don't want to damage iPhone itself. This item is great, protects otherwise!"
"I have a problem with a proximity sensor because there is no hole on  the protector it is transparent so whenever i make a call the screen is totally dimmed i cant open the pad or even hang up the call so i have to usa the headset, for the privacy it is good but it is anti finger printing"
"its a decent phone case however after about three months the kickstand broke on me, and also trying to get this case off of your phone is a pain in the rear. i hope you have some tools to pry it off or some strong fingers"
This is a nice stand for the apple watch making it very easy to slip it on to charge at night. The bamboo wood is a nice light pine style color. I'd use it more for my phone but there is no way to attach the lightning end of the charger cable so you have to fish for it each time which just feels a little awkward for a stand. If they could include a simple way to fix the cable in the right position to push the phone into it would get 5 stars.
I love this product can charge multiple devices and it holds a charge great.  My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to charge the battery if low.  It seems like it takes a long time.  But overall extremely pleased and it is a great value for the money.
"The selling point for this power bank is its portability; it can easily be kept in your pocket, purse or backpack to be carried with you: 5.5 inches long, 2.75 inches wide, about 1/4 of an inch thick, and it weighs in at about 5.3 ounces per our postal scale.<br /><br />Interesting device. Operating this battery is a breeze -- just charge it up and then connect it to your Apple lightning compatible device with the built-in, very short lightning cable.<br /><br />This unit is priced at the top of the range for a power bank with 3200mAh capacity, especially since it's output flow is under 2.A (1.6A rated), and it can only be used to charge devices that use a lightning connection. Would recommended it if you are looking for a super portable power bank like this, just to have in case of an emergency.<br /><br />Extremely portable; if you are looking for a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then give this thin lightning compatible power bank a try.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
"Although a high quality item, it did not stay connected properly to the iPhone with a proper fit on the charging cord, possibly an old design fit for an earlier iPhone than the 6."
like the way it is able to be attached vertical or horizontal... handy that the air from the vent keeps the phone cool --
"This is a great phone, truly, for the price. Need little work on the configuration. I am using H2o 4G LTE network."
This is one of the worst products i have ever purchased from amazon. I got 1 star because i hade to click one to submitt it. Problem is that I had the case for less than 3 weeks and it was already peeling. I have taken the case off my phone because all the peeling makes it look ugly and trashy. So this was a bad product. I will tell anyone NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! ITS HORRIBLE!!!!
Good product but does not fit Sprint phone's buttons. Verizon only.
"I had to upgrade my car mount to fit my iPhone 6. I did some research and came across this and it had about 2000 review with 4 stars. It is not common on Amazon to see that many good reviews for a specific product.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The suction cup is very good and basically works everywhere on my dashboard. I see that some people had an issue of the suction cup leaving a mark on there dash board but mine didn't even after leaving my car in direct sunlight for some time.<br />- There are many ways you can put it and it allows for adjustments to your liking.<br />-Fits many phones with no problem.<br />-Easy mechanism to attach and remove your phone, which I really like.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Feels cheap but I can't complain to much considering that I have purchased more expensive mounts that broke.<br />-The adjustment knob gets itself loose after a few bumpy rides. This is annoying because I constantly have to adjust it while driving.<br /><br />Over all it's is a great product and I have been using it for quite a few months now with no major issues."
"The macro lens got stuck after putting it into the clip for the first time, making the Fish Eye lens unusable. I tried everything to get that lens out but it wouldn't budge. The threading must've been off or something."
"Could never get rid of dust particles/bubbles.  Believe they came from wipe and cheap microfiber cloth.  Very disappointed in this, tried the tape but when you lift to use tape it just gets worse.  Also, didn't feel directions were clear that came with box.  Website had better insight but unfortunately by then my cover was full of dust particles.  I would not recommend this."
Great case
"Had trouble pairing with Samsung Galaxy because the instructions are misleading. When you hold the power button down as they specify you get a blinking light, but that isn't the pairing mode. You have to hold it down longer until  you get a much brighter flashing red and blue light to enter pairing mode.    Once you get them working you will want to know that you no longer have to hold a cell phone to your ear with one hand, but instead you have to use both hands to hold the ear buds in order to keep them from falling on the floor. Maximum volume is barely sufficient and the quality is just ok for phone but volume and quality not very good for music, and besides who can listen to music having to keep spitting on your ear buds to get them to stay in your ears for at least another 15 seconds?   Truly a piece of garbage."
"I had some shipping problems so I just reiceived it yesteday. The phone turn on the first time and worked fine, but today it just shut down. Im conecting it to the wall charger, but its dead."
Good product for a fraction of the price! Works great! Covers the expensive watch nicely.
Dropped my phone 4-5 times on accident after putting the case on. Still not one scratch on my phone.
"When I received my item in the mail I noticed that the plastic case packaging was cracked in 2 separate spots that went all the way through to the other side and the screen protector was bent, I applied it to my phone and have to constantly apply pressure to keep it flush with the phone."
Great case for being cheap. Plastic is weak and broke in the thin spots within the first week. Looks very slick tho.
"This review is 2 years overdue, my apologies.<br />I actually purchased these for my best friend and she loved them. For as long as she had the phone until she upgraded to the newer Samsung Galaxy phone she only used one of the three screen protectors that this came with. They are that good that she didn't even need to use a second one."
"very loud for its size... I work in a factory plant where its loud ... there is a lot of fork lift traffic so having earphones is very dangerous because you can not hear them coming or honking.... so the fact that you can just hang this on your belt loop, you can keep your ears wide open to hear anything and in the mean while enjoy your music"
"Worked okay for the first couple weeks or so. Then the cord started generating noise and static. Wiggling the cord at the 3.5mm end alleviates the noise slightly, but you can still hear it in the background. I really expected a better product from Sony."
Well - this did not work well. It broke while attaching it to the bike - the locking handle just decomposed into pieces. That pretty much ended the ability to use the product. Do not recommend buying this item.
"Small, portable product for a great price.  Huge plus, the battery lasts a long time!  Use this product daily."
"Great sturdy case, holster holds live securely ave the holster clips onto belt smoothly avid secure. Very firm nicely engineered case.  Can't beat the price for such a good case."
"Good sturdy case. Works great for me. The only issue is the thin rubber base at the.bottom of the phone, hence the four stars and not five"
Perfect protection & easily accessible once you get it broke in or used to the one handed technique to get it off the holster.
"Great product, GREAT experience!"
"headphones work but remote does not!! now I have to spend extra on remote, if i can only find it!!"
Blu makes great devices. This is a tablet but it can't be use as a cell phone. For me it's a little awkward because it's a little too big. But it's great the image is very clear it's very sturdy product.
"I received my items fast and it was unfortunate that I had received a bad battery but after contacting the company and telling them about my issue, they were more than willing to send me a new battery. These batteries have been a life saver to me and I would definitely recommend it."
"I love this phone case because if it's multiple uses. It's not cheaply made, it has stood against my teething child gnawing on it with no wear to show for it. The design is adorable! Overall, this was an awesome purchase, well worth it, came earlier than expected, no issues. Would definitely purchase from this seller again."
Very happy with quality and performance.
this new tom tom is great as other one was old and would tell you to turn after you past the street or exit. thank you
"Only two of three lens came, and of course, the lens I wanted (the macro) was the one that didn't arrive."
"This is a great little fitness tracker, especially for the price. My only complaint is that I bought a slim wristband and it had a tendency to unclasp and fall off my wrist. It wasn't that big of a deal until it fell off when I was out in the woods. Get in the car, look down and oops! No more fitness tracker. Wah, wah.<br /><br />Since my basic tracker was MIA, it was time for an upgrade. I looked at several trackers that offered some pretty fierce competition with Jawbone's newer bands, both in price and capabilities, and I stayed with the Jawbone simply because their customer service is really really good. If you have any problems with any of your bands, give them a call and they will make it better."
"I did not want to pay the price for Samsungs wireless charger. I found this one and gave it a try. It may not charge as fast as Samsungs, but it definitely gets the job done. The blue light looks good as its charging. Just an FYI if you use this by your bed at night, it will definitely light up the room. As it charges the blue light turns on and off. When it is charged the blue lignt turns solid. Overall its great and I would recommend it."
Excellent product.  Bought 3 for a vacation where I would be away from power sources.  There worked far beyond expectations.
I was surprised that it is very good and it has a sticker guide that helps it adhere to the exact position..  There are is a halo effect on it and that is because of the curved screen on the phone..
"I have to say, it's worth the price for what it does, anti-scratch class screen protector and it also prevents the screen from shattering."
Excellent quality. Love that the case is detachable and that the protective case is thin so still fits with factory belt clip.  Love it!
Easy connection but can't use it with the cassette for better quality sound as hoped as it squelches really badly no matter the volume.  When using the low FM receiver function on it we find that the lower station frequencies are now so crowded with religious channels that it is impossible in some areas to listen to your music as the stations bleed through.
Microphone did not work.Picked up a hum sound no matter what I turned oof. Sent back for refund.
This replacement screen is noticeable smaller than the original size.  Not happy with the product.  I would recommend purchasing from another vendor.
It fits well on my iPod touch 4th generation. BUT......... The rubberized later is kind of loose so it might not protect as well as one may want.
Worked to charge but not for data.
It's not as private as some but it doesn't have the annoying little lines in it that others have. Excellent product!!!!
I've been looking for a phone case for my Galaxy S5 for a while now and all that I could find were boring. This one had me a little worried at first since my experience with gem stones on phone cases had never been good since they tend to fall off easily.<br />This case not only looks cute but it's made of quality. I'm not sure what they used to get this gem stones on and to stay on but whatever it is it works! I can actually put my phone in my pocket without my phone case falling apart.<br /><br />*I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review
Fast shipping. Great price. Good power. Nice crossover.
Didn't work with my provider. Should have checked the band's before purchase. Seemed fine though.
"I have had 2 of these cases and loved the convenience. They protect my phone well and are super handy. The only reason I can't give five stars is that they only last 2-3 months before the prongs on the id holder door break off and you can no longer use it as a wallet. After having this happen twice I just decided to buy a nice wallet (wristlet) with a phone pocket on the side.<br /><br />For the price, it's not a bad little case. Good for a concert or vacation!"
"Thay are great sounds great performs awsome, I recamend them to anyone"
"My phone charges in 1 hour with Anker cables and 4 hours with cheap $1 cables. The difference is probably lower resistance, thicker gauge wire, which means less voltage loss between your charger and your device (phone). Good build quality. I use the longest cable reaches the back seat of a sedan when plugged into the DC power socket (cigarette adapter) next to the stereo."
"This is the perfect wallet case. I bought for my husband who hates to carry his wallet and credit cards. He now carries his phone, drivers lic and 2 credit cards with some money and it all fits in 1 case. Does not take up much space and he says it still fits in his pocket if he doesn't want to carry it. I give it 5 stars."
"A great case, that's actually made to fit the Droid Turbo (Ballistic Nylon version).  Sleek, stylish and overall great design."
"Just to be blunt, I dropped my phone with this case on it and the screen cracked... Useless!"
"I really liked these at first.  I like to listen to audio books and be able to answer my phone.  I didn't get many complaints about volume issues with this pair.  I bought these for $18 and Cootree Jogger for $30, www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQG6QFG, they have come down to $24.  With the Cootree I get lot's of volume complaints for the mic, whereas these had very few.  What I did notice was these had a shorter battery life by far, so I ended up using the other pair.  I would switch out when the battery went low but I noticed that that I was using the other pair 3 to 4 times as long.  They would last days and this pair would last 1/2 a day.  Still the mic was good so in the car was better with these.<br /><br />OK so because of the battery, which I don't think was bad as they would play music or books for hours, 6-8 hours, but just not close to the other, I ended up using them infrequently.  I noticed that one side's earpiece was separating at the seam about two weeks ago.  I took some electrical tape and taped it as I've read the reviews on the plastic going around the ear breaking.  I'll add my photos to the product page.  Well I wish I taped the other side too but I didn't notice any wear or separation so didn't.  The other side broke within two weeks.<br /><br />Since I had these only since April, that's a little less than 5 months, and I wasn't using them as my main pair.  Not worth the $18 as if they had been my main pair they would've broke in a month or two."
"I  like  this  phone  better  than  the  gusto 3  ( newest model )  ,  chiefly  because  of  the  speaker  phone  is  much  crisper  in  sound  quality..."
Received the tempered glass screen protector on the day they said it would arrive. I have a moto g 2gen and this product fits perfect. So easy to install. I love this protector its crystal clear. It also has a lifetime warranty which is one reason i decided to buy. Would definitely recommend this to others.
"The title of the publication says 3350 mAh, but in the technical specifications set in the battery says 3200 mAh. Why the difference ?"
Worked great for a couple weeks then nothing. This is my second one with the same result.
This really holds my Garmin in place on my large van dashboard.  Great product!
"It was okay, not the best quality but you get what you paid for."
Great case.  Very durable.  I have gotten several compliments on it.  Simple and not bulky.
The plastic casing is brittle a breaks easily. I was only able to use me case for two weeks before it was so cracked and broken it wouldn't hold my phone any longer.
Love it! I have had my first one for almost two years. We use it on a weekly basis and it works great.
Battery life is 2 days with everything on!  some say it makes the phone too big but i think its easier to hold and handle. It charges fast and lasts twice as long! Im very happy with this purchase The $8.00 honeycomb rubber case fits slightly loose and protects ok for the price. Strongly suggest the Seidio DILEX extended case. Cost more but protects better.
"Heavy and does keep the GPS in the position it needs to be.  But, it isn't as pictured.  There is no cutout for the GPS to sit behind.  It's more of a donut shape. It causes the GPS to have to point upward awkwardly because the arm mount of our Garmin isn't tall enough to reach above the outside.  We sent it back because it bothered us but some might find this acceptable.  Otherwise, the quality was great, heavy fabric and heavy overall to prevent slippage."
"Perfect fit, as described and arrived early. Protects phone very well."
Excellent quality.  I like that the length is very long so I can watch TV way across the<br />room with my headphones. Thank you.
I am very pleased with my Pyle Rear View camera. I did buy the wireless sending unit which made installing it a lot simpler by not having to fish wires from back to the front of my  a van. Also the camera was easier to adjust. Only one small hole to drill and camera mounted on license plate. works very well.
Super Cute. Has a faint weird smell but can't really tell unless your nose is smashed into the case.
Lots of features and possibilities. Sometimes to much information during the exercise. The instruction manual could be more detailed to allow a more straight forward configuration.
"OK guys, get out your rulers again.  This is not a 6&#34; fan.  Overall frame is 4-3/4 inches square x 1 inch deep.  Fan blade diameter is 4-3/8 inches."
This item is nowhere near the quality of it's competitors. I wish I would have just purchased the slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B00HAAJQ2Q Cellet Ultra-Thin (0.3mm) High Transparency 9H Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]. The cellet was the first screen protector I had purchased and it lasted comparatively longer that this product. This protector scratched almost immediately when it fell out of my pocket while working underneath my truck. The cellet has experienced this multiple times without a scratch.
"This is the best charger I've ever used. I'm surprised how much enthusiasm I can have for a car charger, but this little charger is seriously great. It charges faster than any charger (car or wall) that I've ever used. I can run Pandora over Bluetooth and have Google Maps running when I'm driving, and the phone will still get to 100% charge by the time I get where I'm going."
The Velvet Skin Coat arrived on time and in good condition. The product is as promised and looks great. I don't wear makeup but it makes my skin looks smooth when I put it with my moisturizer.
Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
"Pros:  Installs way easier than plastic film covers. Incredibly slick and smooth,  even more elegant to the touch than the original screen.  Very resistant to scratch.  No regrets at all.<br /><br />Cons:  On the Note 4, the protector doesn't cover the outer 2 millimeters around the edges, because the original screen is slightly rounded, and thus a wider flat protector would not adhere. It is very minor, the unprotected part is very small and negligible,  thus I still give this 5 stars."
Good GPS. I needed it for both US and canada and it works. The traffic informations give you the right indications to avoid traffic on your way.<br />Need to buy new maps for my next trip in Europ. Gonna see if it's working then.
Terrible! Phone will not even turn on properly. It really is a hit or miss when it comes to these discounted batteries. I wish I had tried installing sooner before I lost the window to return.<br /><br />The NY Sticker was no where to be found at all.<br /><br />Hopefully the attached link could give you some insight on the battery you receive &#34;see cycle count&#34;. I wish I had not waited so long and very disappointed in this product.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOOZZeTTR1o
"The connection is somewhat disappointing, a lot of static from time to time. But for the price, it is a good buy."
I'm a huge harry potter fan so when I saw this case I had to have it. I've had zero issues with this case. I love it!
It works in my phone and the price was outstanding!!<br />The last one I had lasted almost 4 years with charging then just started to go dead....all the time.<br />I'll keep track with this one.....even if it only lasts a year??? The price makes up for it! Ha!
This case does NOT fit the G4 with the leather back like the description claims. It doesn't wrap all the way to the front of the phone and somehow my phone got damage to the bottom edge while putting this case on. It's going back.

"Hi,<br /><br />This is my review of the product listed on Amazon as:<br /><br />IPhone Case, IPhone 6 Case - TURATA Premium Handmade Bling Crystal Diamonds Sweet Love Blowing Dandelion Brushed Metal Design Back Case Cover for IPhone 6 (4.7&#34;)(Value Package)<br /><br />I received this product a few weeks ago and had time yesterday to evaluate it for a detailed review.  I have also included several photos that I took of the cases and accessories in use for anyone who is interested.<br /><br />This is for all current colors: Red, Blue, Pink, Grey, and Gold<br /><br />UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:<br /><br />What’s great about this product from TURATA is that they do a really good job with the packaging.  I mean, really good.  I’ve had phone cases come in from other brands and all they give is a simple white box with their logo and the case inside.  Here, with TURATA, you get a pretty welcoming experience.<br /><br />First the box comes wrapped in a candy like wrapper package to make it feel like a gift.<br /><br />Upon opening that wrap, there’s the dark purple wavy design pattern on the gift box with the TURATA logo and website on the bottom of the top lid of the box.<br /><br />When you open up the lid, what you’ll find is behind the lid is a company message to the owner of the product edged in gold coloring with thanks and appreciation.  An e-mail address is provided.<br /><br />In the holding box, there’s the stainless steel stylus pen with rubber tip, a packaged dust plug, and a TURATA tan colored pouch that’s folded up to fit the box with the TURARA logo again.  Inside the pouch is where the phone case is located.<br /><br />So overall, with the packaging, I was impressed how delicate and premium it felt for them to spend so much time with the packaging and boxing to make it a great welcoming experience.<br /><br />I haven’t seen other brands do this with their cell phone cases when I get them delivered from Amazon.  So they get points for that.<br /><br />In looking at the stylus pen, I thought it looked nice at first.  It is smooth and comfortable to hold based on its curved design.  I tested the rubber tip on my phone and it was responsive and didn’t have much of any issues.  The problem I had that I didn’t like about the stylus pen was that it rolls around too easily.  If you put it on a glass table top surface, it’s going to keep rolling until it hits something to stop it on the table or it will fall off the table onto the ground with a lot of noise from impact.  I didn’t like this design too much.  What I suggest and prefer is if TURATA keeps a similar design of this, but adds a silicon layer coating over some part of this stylus pen to give it some resistance and friction to any table top surface that you put it on so that it will hold still.  Also, if this could include a clip on component to it to clip onto shirt pockets and other things, that would be great too.  Otherwise, just simply putting the current form of this stylus pen into your pocket will do, but will also cause the rubber tip to attract dust.<br />The dust plug has a nice design to it.  Both the phone case “Bling” and dust plug “Bling” are really Rhinestones.  And that makes sense because they can’t sell a $10 phone case with real diamonds or premium crystals.  Otherwise, they’d go out of business.  But these do look nice as is, not only for kids and teenagers, but for older women as well.  Because of the elegant styling of the dust plug and phone case design, I don’t recommend this for men.  This is purely intended for the female audience to enjoy.  So feel free to get this for your lady friends, cousin, niece, sister, aunt, mom, or grandma.<br /><br />Each dust plug has a different design to it.  They each have two larger crystals that complement the color of the case.  So Blue case will have blue crystals on the dust plug, and so forth.  It’s a good color matching pattern that is separate for each phone color case that you get from TURATA.  It’s good to take a picture of them when you get them to not lose track of which dust plug for which phone case it goes to.  Some dust plugs have a large Eiffel tower piece attached to it by itself.  Others have a long necklace type of design with smaller crystals looping around followed by a smaller Eiffel tower piece.  The plug is a plastic material, which I don’t like as much.  I would’ve liked seeing a more harder and firm gripping material when plugged into the audio port of your phone to keep it held in more easily and resist from tugging on it.  That’s what I provide as a suggestion.  Perhaps stainless steel would be good.<br /><br />The phone cases each have a nice artwork design etched onto the case.  The case is fairly rough the way it was printed, likely from a 3D printer.  When I feel around it with my fingers, I feel the white horizontal line patterns throughout the case, from the interior.  They won’t scratch up your phone, but it does feel sort of rough.<br /><br />The exterior of the phone case has a nice smooth polish and is reflective where you look at it from the source of light.  This is reflective even without having the light hit the rhinestones.  Some people like it.  That glossy look does bring the color and the etched design out more.<br /><br />The artwork is of a boy and girl with a love symbol floating on top of the girl near some large and small dandelions.  The color of the case that you get from TURARA has the color noticeable on the first half of the case towards the bottom.  It fades towards a transparent coating on the way up.  This is important to know because some phones have a colored backing already on them, such as gold, space grey, or silver, and depending on what color case that you get, some cases look better once installed on one colored phone, but the same can’t be said if you take those same case colors that you liked and installed it on another phone colored backing.<br /><br />So for my evaluation and review, I had with me my iPhone 6 Gold colored phone to compare between the 5 colors for that gold backing.  For the other iPhone 6 colors, I suggest trying to find someone else who may reviewed and showed photos of it.<br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />Installing the case was simple  I just aimed at an angle to tuck in the corner with the rear camera lens in first to fit the hole carved out for it, then placed the rest of the phone down into the case and pushed in have a snapping sound.  The case is flexible and bendable along the edges, which makes it more easy to install and not that difficult to remove.  To remove the case, I recommend going from the bottom corner of the case and aim at the corner to pry with your fingers while putting grip with your other finder into the power port of your iPhone.  Then continue to pull along that same side, which will detach the phone from the top corner and then the rest will come off.<br /><br />Each colored case, I installed it and took photos of how it looked indoors with certain levels of lighting coming in compared to going outdoors.  These photos were taken between 1pm to 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, when the sun had come out.<br /><br />I’m going to go through each color and give my opinion and ranking.<br /><br />Blue case:<br /><br />When taking the blue case out of the yellow pouch, I thought to myself that this blue is a little too light of a color to fit in well with a gold background, even when looking at the pouch that was a tanned color rather than a gold color of my iPhone 6.  It doesn’t stand out due to the light Teal color.  I would’ve suggested a darker blue to have a good level of contrast between that and other colors.  And maybe it’s because of the gold.  If it was space grey or silver for the iPhone 6, maybe it would look better?<br /><br />When putting it into my hand, the edges of the bottom half of the case could be seen well with the Teal blue color.  The center of thebottom region of the case has a higher transparent mesh of the teal and the color of my hand behind it.<br /><br />When installing the iPhone 6 case onto it with the dust plug, it gave it a more light transition of blue into the gold backing of the phone.  The color had a more washed out soft touch looking appearance towards the bottom half below the large dandelion.  With indoor lighting, this looked sort of OK.  But I saw more clearly in the transparency than the blue that I think people would want to buy the case for.  The edges were more vivid in the teal color blue.  Up close, you can see the white etched streak marks across every part of the phone case.  I’m not sure if that’s by design or not.  The dust plug does look nice with this colored case.<br /><br />When taking it outdoors into the bright sunlight, the blue that could be seen did not look really good with this gold backing.  There just wasn’t enough of the color there to really want to stand out well.  The soft touch may look OK within an indoors setting, but outdoors in the sunlight, it doesn’t look good.  In the outdoor shade, it has an OK look with the soft touch of the blue focused more on the boy and girl etched image.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this case for the gold backing of the iPhone 6.<br /><br />Grey case:<br /><br />The grey case has a darker tone to it under the tan colored pouch.  When raising the case up with my hand, it has a more classical drawn and illustrated look to it.  The gray you could see well from the pouch and holding it up with your hand.  However, when you install it on the phone with a gold colored backing, it has a different look of positive or negative depending on which angle you’re holding it.  In the indoor lighting, holding it at certain angles with the reflection of the lighting hitting it didn’t make the gray stand out enough to look good.  When I avoided some of the glaring reflection indoors, the gray color looked better for the etched design around the boy and girl.  It did give the overall look from gold on top to gray on the bottom a strange look.  I’d say you’d get more looks with this colored case indoors than the blue one that I looked at earlier.<br /><br />In the outdoor shade, the colored case didn’t look too well from how I saw it through the photo.  However, in direct sunlight, it looked a little better.<br /><br />Overall, I’d rank the grey case better than the blue case, for a gold colored iPhone 6<br /><br />Red case:<br /><br />The red case from TURATA when looking at it for the first time had a nice look to it.  It’s like a more champagne red color.  It had a more deep tone in the color than the other colored cases observed.  And while I was evaluating this, I found it looked better with the thicker depth of the color onto the case.<br /><br />When installing this case on the gold backing of an iPhone 6, this looked really nice in the indoor lighting setting.  The gold that goes through the white streaked transparency of the phone case on top has a nice looking transition at the center as it goes into the red coloring towards the bottom.  It actually complements the artwork very well, with the love or affection in the red and the dimmer gold tone for the brightness of a sky appearance on the case.<br /><br />In the outdoor shade, the red stood out well with the gold that dimmers a little and had a nice overall experience.  Even in bright direct sunlight it had a nice look to it where the red darkened out well.<br /><br />I like this colored case for this iPhone 6 gold backing and I would recommend it.<br /><br />So far, I’d rank them as the following:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Grey<br />3) Blue<br /><br />Gold case:<br /><br />The gold colored case in front of the tanned colored pouch made it hard to see much of any difference.  Holding it with my hand made the gold look so washed out and transparent that I saw more of the white streak lines more than anything.<br /><br />However, when installing it onto my iPhone 6 case, the gold on the case was slightly more noticeable because it was darker in the bottom half than the top half, which had the gold backing of the iPhone seen through it.  It has a very smooth transition and because it’s gold on gold of different coated layers, it’s almost better than a clear case, but hard to tell from clear case, if you know what I mean.  In the indoor lighting, I could see the dark to lighter gold transition more easily.<br /><br />However, outdoors, in the shade for example, I wasn’t able to tell the gold color of the casing at all.  In the bright sunlight, the darker shade of gold on the case was barely noticeable.  I think this sort of faded, hard to tell look, reminded me the same way when I evaluated the blue colored case.  I didn’t like neither of them because what is the purpose of buying a colored case when you can barely see it in the light?<br /><br />So to rank these again, I’d put the gold better than the blue just because of a nice looking transition in the indoor lighting, but I wouldn’t recommend it for the gold colored backing of the case.<br /><br />Ranking:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Gray<br />3) Gold<br />4) Blue<br /><br />The last color for the evaluation is:<br /><br />Pink:<br /><br />The pink color had a washed out look to it that is a mixed feeling between the blue case and the gold case.  It’s not clearly visible even while in front of the tannish colored pouch.  In my hand, it wasn’t as clearly visible with the pink.  It was a very light touch of a coating onto the case.  When installing it on the Gold iPhone, it had a very light touch and transition from how light the gold looks on the top and towards the bottom, the light and dim tone of the pink.  It doesn’t really stand out at all, and if that’s your intention is to give it a color mixture that doesn’t stand out a lot, then this case is for you.  Oddly, the way that you hold the angle of the iPhone with this case installed, the pink can come out a little more vivid than when you’re looking straight into it with some glare from the polish the case has.<br /><br />Outdoors in the shade, the pink was faded and had a dull look to it.  This was the same observance in direct sunlight.  In direct sunlight, you can see the mild transition from pink to gold, but it’s a very light touch.  Personally for me, I like colors that stand out, so it’s a user preference.<br /><br />I would not recommend this color for a gold backing iPhone 6.<br /><br />So after evaluating the colors available, I rank them as follows:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Grey<br />3) Pink<br />4) Gold<br />5) Blue<br /><br />What’s good to know about these cases is that they have cutout holes for all buttons on the iPhone 6, including the volume buttons, sleep wake button, and the silence button.<br /><br />What’s missing that I suggest TURATA improves upon is adding depth in the front so that if the phone were to fall and land face first, then it would be very critical to avoid damage if the case could absorb the impact.  Having the front of the case curve out in the front and add up to 1/8th of an inch of thickness all around would help.  Otherwise, users will need to buy a tempered glass screen protector to protect the front of their iPhone because this current design case does not offer that protection.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) Premium gift wrapped packaging<br />2) Pretty artwork etched in that has a nice look and feel<br />3) Smooth exterior with added gloss that makes it looks and feels nice<br />4) Rhinestones offer a gleaming shimmer effect under the sun<br />5) Wide selection of colored cases to tailor for different colored phones<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) Stylus Pen rolls around too easily uncontrollably on smooth surfaces<br />2) Case does not protect the front of the phone from drops and impacts<br />3) Some colors have a faded dull appearance whentaken outdoors or under certain reflective indoor lighting that does not look good for the iPhone color backing<br /><br />SUGGESTIONS:<br /><br />1) Redesign the side of the TURATA case mold so that wraps over to the front side and adds from depth of coverage.  About 1/8th inch should be sufficient all around the front edges<br />2) Provide a silicon portion on at least one portion of the stylus end or handle to provide more friction and act as a stopper from rolling around on smooth tabletop surface<br />3) Replace the plastic molding for the dust plug with a stronger alternative that holds better<br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />This product would be good for people who:<br /><br />1) Want to have a flashy design for a cell phone case<br />2) Are in relationships<br />3) Want to present this as a gift to a lady for friendship or relationship matters<br />4) Want an attractive case that symbolizes who they are and what they’re about<br /><br />Overall, I think these cases are nice for women of all ages.  Couples can pair themselves with these cases as well, but it appears the etching and bling is more for the feminine side.  I was blown away by the packaging material after having gone through so many previous phone case orders with other brands and seeing how the boxing and wrapping was meant to be discarded right away.<br /><br />These case selections for your phone should be considered based on the type of iPhone you have because each of them have one of three different colored backings with will make the overall selection and preference from each other different in the overall look and appeal.<br /><br />I received samples of this product from the manufacturer to help give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  This review is to also help with prospective buyers make smart, informed decisions based on the information available to them.<br /><br />I hope my photos were helpful.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.gn around the boy and girl.

Phone case arrived on time. Great quality. Works well
"These r great. I use in gym, and they have never fallen out.  I would recommend them to anyone and would definitely purchase them again."
This is an amazing charger it charges my device quickly but the wall adapter offen get really hot at times
It's OK ... larger than I'd like.  Belt clip falls off occasionally ... haven't tried the armband.  When it stops working I'll buy something different.
Ok product. Thought it would be  a better  quality
I had my phone for less than a week before the screen cracked. The phone does not have enough screen protection with this case. I would highly recommend spending the extra money on stronger case
headset has excellent sound quality with many features such as the stealth feature which activates noise cancellation to queltch the noise from extreme wind.
"Love the iPhone 6 plus, this IPhone 6 Plus Belt Clip Holster case makes it too large to fit in my shirt pocket. (a convenience for me) I did use the belt holster for the Defender. So, I decided to sacrifice the protection for convenience and traded the cases for a more slim protective case and glass screen protector. Also love the High quality Faux-Leather pouch,Soft interior prevent scratches.

"Amazing sound - not very comfortable, I'm not used to these type of earphones so I'm going to have to give it more time. The sound is awesome! Super deep bass, earphones itself feels sturdy. Not a big fan of long cord going around the back of my neck, using the cord holder makes it even more uncomfortable (it tugs the earphones back) and not using it makes the left earphones cable jump forward. I ran for an hour and a half (on a treadmill) the first day I got it and went to work, charged it for about 2-3 hours and got about 4 hours of use, I hear you can get up to 6-8 continuous hours use out of it - overall I'm very happy with the earphones and price."
"Nice. Would recommend getting a case or cover to go over the backing. The backing it comes with is not very durable. Even if you drop it on carpet or something soft, it will automatically come off and battery will fly out as well."
I highly recommend reviewing the youtube video prior to installation and prep work and thorough cleaning is the key to perfection.  This was my first time ever doing this and my application went ever better than the one shown in the video. It adhered completely to every edge without a single bubble...amazing!  I would definitely recommend this screen protector and will be buying the smartphone version soon since the current one I have was installed by a &#34;professional&#34; who didn't take the time to clean properly.
It stopped working a week after unpacking this cable. Terrible quality. Didn't expect this from Tech Armor
"Just got this in the mail and am excited to say it perfectly connects my docking station in my Toyota to my Galaxy s5 phone. The loudest volume setting is just a little lower than my normal speakers with just the radio on, but I can play my music now so that's a super minor issue."
"if you dont allready know, you should never buy apple lightning cables, and if your apple cable hasn't broken yet, it will.  this three pack of cables gets the job done without requiring you being gentle with them.<br />pros:  fits in iphone 5/5s Fre lifeproof case (not sure about iphone 6)<br />durable enough (travel with it, bend it,)<br />charges my ipad air 2 at 2.4 amps (unlike my defective apple cable)<br />28/3= $9 per cable: great deal (apple's are $20)<br /><br />cons: lightning end is a little bigger than the apple cable so i dont think it will fit in every waterproof case (the cheaper ones) but it will fit in the expensive iphone 5 lifeproof cases and im pretty sure otterbox too<br /><br />i did get this product for free because there were no reviews on it at the time, and they needed reviews on a new product, however they did NOT ask for a positive review, i felt it deserved it so my review is not biased"
Makes my husband feel like he's a luxury car when he's cruising around in his 98 blazer. ha ha ha ha
I used this charger right after it arrived on a trip and I was really impressed with how well it charged my Android phone. My phone went completey dead 2 times and this device fully recarged it both times. I do not know how much was left on the charer. I would recomend this to buy.
3 Months later and it's dead. Just quit working. And since it has been more than 30 days I can't return or even exchange it. Horrible. Do not buy.  **EDIT** Soon after I left a one star review the company reached out to me. They have sent me a new portable charger at no cost. I changed the rating on the review based on the the level of customer service.  Very excellent customer service. Hopefully this charger lasts longer than 3 months!
Does a great job.  Charges the phone quickly.  Much better than the generic thing you'd find at a drug store.
Handy....nice you can put a couple of cards along with your ID in it
"I was one of the first to preorder this product.  As an avid TCDS believer and user, I had been looking for something small and discrete that I can bring to the office and not worry about the million stares I'd get from wearing one of the &#34;other&#34; similar devices.<br /><br />The vibes work great.  As someone else notes, the effects are a bit subtle, but I prefer subtle than the jittery effects I get from the normal stimulants.  I'm the kind of person who gets all weird when I drink too much coffee and folks notice it.  The stimulant effect here is clear in that I'm level headed and can express my thoughts without the fog.<br /><br />The calming vibes I think has pretty much cured my insomnia so that alone makes it worth every penny.<br /><br />Folks who are looking for a &#34;high&#34; or &#34;low&#34; I think is barking up the wrong tree.  The intent I think is to enhance your mood not be so invasive that others notice.  But of course that's my opinion.  Thanks for the great product!"
"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
"Cobra's iconic 148 GTL took a slight redesign in the phase-locked loop system back in 2008 utilizing a Chinese produced chip . The radio out-of-the-box is acceptable, performance is a bit low but with a few tweaks to make it a relatively good, loud CB radio. Out-of-the-box, most of these radios are 200 to 300 Hz frequency, perfectly acceptable under FCC standards but by resetting to dead center on all bands radio audio quality on the receiving end really pops as it stands out. If you're wishing to add an echo board to the radio, do not use the turbo echo board products as they have a tendency to growl and continuously reverberate unnecessarily in deep echo. I would also suggest that you purchase as an option a 12 gauge 3 pin power plug for Cobra but only change the fuse out to one more amp if the radio has been properly performance tuned, as the additional current draw in SSB will cause a warble when using single side band with the original power cord. In a.m. mode with out the upgraded power cord , the TX modulation tiends to peak negative on an oscilloscope as the unit is virtually power starved at 95% modulation with the original power cord. An indication of being power starved is if the meter lights dim when you're talking, it is because it is not getting enough current to operate efficiently. Also, if this radio is modified for additional frequencies you will find that it is somewhat less stable than the..... older 148 GTL's"
well worth the cost.  difficult to see/feel the button icons in the darkness of the early morning.
"Works well. Viewing angle could be better...  but for the cost, great monitor!"
I love this phone  it came in excellent condition as I expected.
I play a lot of golf and I really like the Approach S3. Courses are easily recognized and the convenience of having it on my wrist  is great. I previously was a user of Sky Caddie. This is much better in my opinion.
Never saw any liquid but somehow it leaked. I never dropped it and no cracks????? Idk. Cute for a week
Absolutely the best iPhone charging/data cable out there. It's durable and better quality than the original Apple cable that comes with the phone/iPod. I got the 6ft one and it's perfect for use in bed or connecting a docking station to your computer.
"My only suggestion to the manufacturer is that the support arm also have an up/down adjustment to accommodate cars with slanted dash boards (civics, etc.)"
"I love this solar charger. Not only is it very useful but it is super cool. It is well made, thick and sturdy. Everyone wants to know about it and how it works. "
"I purchased this case for my daughter for her birthday to go along with her new ipod.  She likes blue, so I figured with the blue silicone part and the pretty floral design, she would be happy.  This case is really pretty in person.  I love the design of the floral hard shell.  Unfortunately it is super hard to get on the ipod, well not hard to put on, but hard to make it look right.  The silicone part gets kind of squished up in parts so it doesn't look totally smooth and even like you would want.  We did get it, but it took several tries.  After about a month, my daughter dropped her ipod and the outer shell case cracked as well.  So, for actual protection of the ipod, it has done a good job because the silicone part really cushions falls.  But the case does not necessarily stand up to abuse - it is a very crackable plastic.  Very pretty, but I think next time I will go with something a little more sturdy.  I do really love the silicone liner, I just wish it was easier to get it smoothed on."
"I really liked it, but I ordered purple. What arrived was a redish/pink.  Not the color I ordered at all."
Unfortunately this battery did not wake my ipod back up like I had hoped.  Not sure if it was the battery's fault or if something else was wrong with the ipod.  My ipod keeps saying the battery is low so I thought changing it out would make it start working again...  Bummed out.  I ended up sending the battery back for  a refund--no problem with the return.
"The case and the holder are outstanding. Everything has worked out as advertised.<br />I am very satisfied with the service, as I received it two days, after I ordered it."
"This is a really useful gadget, but it needs instructions. The most important thing to remember with it is that the cover must be open for the battery inside to charge."
Great clear case. Came in looking brand new. Ive ordered cases on Amazon​ before and they were used but I bought them brand new. This one delivers and I highly recommend.
"The Shower mate works well inside and out of the shower. Its very loud in the shower and the sound quality is better than a phone, but not quite as good as a stereo bluetooth speaker. The suction cup is strong, and sticks to many surfaces except except drywall and my cat. The connectivity range is incredible, lasting up to 110 feet outside. Battery life is about 6 hours playback, and recharges in 2. My only concern is the charging cable is not a standard micro USB, so don't lose it! Some people have reported not being able to change the volume or turn it off, but I didnt have this problem, the buttons are multifunctional.<br /><br />▌ SOUND QUALITY ▌<br />It gets more than loud enough in the shower because in there it is amplified, and actually hurts to have it maxed out. I found about 3/4 volume was good.<br />Sound quality is ok. There is moderate distortion above 3/4 volume, particularly in the bass-mids.<br />Using a tone generator, I can get whisper quiet bass as low as 40hz, but in music it's only relevant above 75hz. There is not much bass below 100hz as you should expect from this size of speaker. Deep basslines are barely there, but standard electronic basslines, and acoustic guitars are fine.<br />The mids, highs, and vocals sound good, except in the shower vocals become a little distorted from the echo off the walls. I found puting the speaker in the middle of a wall was better than in the corner.<br />It's fine for music outside the shower to, probably even more so. All that being said, the audio and frequency range is still better than from a phone, tablet, or small notebook, but not quiet as good as a standard portable stereo bluetooth speaker. It is still enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />Call quality is fine, but nothing special. I can clearly hear other people, and they can hear me, but my voice is a bit distorted if I talk to loud or close to the mic (tested with recording on computer). It's not like a phone mic where you need to be close, it picks up voice from a few feet away, but at the same time it does a decent job of dampening the shower noise.<br /><br />▌ BUILD / DESIGN ▌<br />The rounded shape is easy to hold in hand. It's made out of plastic with a rubber texture. The buttons are soft silicone and have a clicky feedback. They are positioned far enough apart and have a bit of mushy space between them so I know which one I'm touching without looking. The suction cup is strong and hasnt fallen off, but it is also easy to pull off and reposition if desired, and sticks to many surfaces. It also floats in water. I opened it up and it is sealed with a rubber O-ring.<br /><br />▌ FUNCTION & CONNECTIVITY ▌<br />The speaker has several controls such as Power, Skip back / Volume down, Skip foreward / Volume up, Pause / Play, and Call / Reject / Redial. So there is no need to be near the phone once you have the playlist or app setup. It also can skip stations on internet radio apps. The only thing I didnt like about the controls was how slow it is to change the volume, it is not changed in increments, you must hold down the button to gradually change it and it takes 13 seconds to go from 0-100%. Not a big deal, but annoying if something plays to loud and you need to turn it down fast.<br /><br />The connectivity remained up to 110ft outside, and was fine anywhere in my house.<br /><br />Battery life lasts 6 hours, and recharges in about 2 hours. It's a 400mAh 3.7V battery. The charging cable is sadly not micro USB, and isnt like any other cable I have, it's like a tiny version of a 3.5mm audio hack, so I would be worried about losing it.<br /><br />There is an LED under the rubber that shines through and show different statuses. It flashes blue ever few seconds so you know it's on. It flashes pink and blue when turning it off. While charging it is solid red, and shuts off when finished.<br /><br />▌ CONCLUSION ▌<br />The showermate is a nice speaker, even outside the shower (maybe even more so). It is more than loud enough and the mic picks up voice from a few feet away. It has a couple minor annoyances like the slow volume change and non-micro USB cable, but overall is good for the price. I give it 4.5 stars because of the uncommon charging cable. Sample provided for testing and review.<br /><br />Specs:<br />Supports: A2DP/AVRCP<br />Input: DC 5V 100~120mA<br />Battery: 3.7V 400mAh Lithium<br />Charging Time: Approx 3 hours<br />Operating Time:Approx 6 hours<br />IP Grade: IPx4<br />Material: Silicone + ABS Plastic<br />Operational Distance: Approx 30 Feet<br />Dimensions: 3.35&#34; x 3.35 x 1.78 Inches<br />Buttons: On/Off, Play/Pause, Previous Track/Volume Down, Next Track/Volume Up, Phone Pick up/Hang up.

These worked fine at first but after using them for a couple of days they stopped working. Not worth the money savings.
Should have paid attention to the poor reviews. The cable works. Elsewhere. The iPhone 6 rejected the charger. I bought an Apple charger instead. Apple is more proprietary than Microsoft ever thought of being back in the old days when Apple was complaining about it.
I needed an iPhone mount that would work with multiple sizes of iPhones and that would make it easy to reach my phone. This mount is great quality and very adjustable so you can really put it just about anywhere. Definitely would recommend
"The fine-point stylus is not as sensitive as I would like.  I find that I have to hold it in a specific position in order for it to work.  This may be caused by the screen cover I have on my iPad, but I would prefer that the stylus worked with the screen cover instead of having to remove it to achieve maximum functionality."
"I really enjoyed these headphones they looked very retro which I liked. A lot of headphones now days look very high-tech  and even though these do not support Bluetooth I would still buy these so I could jam out in style.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very Sleek<br />-Threaded cable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Its not the big over the ear headphones its actually one of those on the ear headphones<br /><br />Overall:<br />Amazing Sound and very stylish as expected. Plus, the headphones are limited edition so get yours before these run out definitely a great steal for the price.<br /><br />Promotion Disclaimer:<br />I received this product during a promotional period in exchange for a unbiased review."
"seems to work just fine with android tablets and phones. paired fine with my usb bt enabled win 7 pc , but that's about lt' nothing works; returning it for a refund."
Very good quality item. Easy to use and at a good price. I would recomendamos this selfie stick to anyone that's looking for an easy to use good quality product.
I've had this in my car for a while now. Loving it so far. working great plus a sleek design as well.
"This case is for my husband's iPhone 6 that has a slim case around it. His phone fits well inside it, and it's easy to get the phone out to answer a call.  The clip is sturdy and securely hooks around his 1 1/2&#34; belt.  He works outside most of the day and moves between different types of equipment, and a flimsy case would not work. We would definitely purchase another one if we needed it.  My husband had a little difficulty with the elastic coming out on one side after about ten months of rough daily use. I contacted Grantwood Technology, and they promptly replaced it. Fantastic customer service!"
"I like this unit.  Both cameras have good resolution during daytime use, both on the road as well as within the vehicle cabin.  The software is easy to operate. I save my daily trips to my computer.  I drive daily & I do not drive without it.  The GPS tracking also is very accurate.  The only negative I have with THIS unit is the visual during night driving.  I plan to purchase the unit with the IR Night Vision feature (see below).<br />Indigi® Dash Cam 2.7&#34; TFT LCD Dual Camera Lens Car DVR IR Night Vision GPS."
Did not fit phone. Waste of money.
"I'm 32 and a mom of three...I.bought this for myself and I am not ashamed! :) It arrived 2 days before expected....awesome service!  I thought the color on the shield was going to be a little brighter, but I'm not disappointed...it still looks great and I'm loving it,"
"Poor quality, only half the functions work at once, wouldn't charge and display HDMI at the same time. the connector bends when I plug it in to my phone and lay it on the table. DO NOT BUY."
it did not hold and stay attached to my phone...useless. had to send it back. i have an android maxx
Great speaker so far. Have had it about a month. I primarily use in the shower but makes a great everyday speaker. Sound quality is decent for the size and the price. Would and have recommended to others.
"Cheap, works great, does what it says it will."
"Picture is a bit deceiving...skin is very cute, but you do not get anything for the front of your phone. Only comes with a sticker/skin for the back."
"I can't believe it is actually glass, so thin and flexible. Almost can't tell the screen has a protector installed. Easy to center despite what others have said, Infact, this is easier any other protector I have used this far. If you have an apple watch. Get this!<br />It comes with 2 screen protectors, various application tools( anti dust stickers, microfiber cloth, anti scratch bubble removing squeegee) and most importantly a lifetime warranty!"
It is very nice I have used it a lot already. Took in a trip and used it more than once.<br />Only thing is that I have to put power to it to get total charge to unit.
Worth every penny and it is beautiful. Only thing that would make it better is to have more color choices.
"At best, a fair fit. Does not cover sides and bottom edges well at bezel. Buttons very hard to use. Warped at top of bezel. Would not buy again. Too many better choices for the money."
"I received this as a free review sample. I've probably reviewed (and then donated) two dozen selfie sticks and after a while most start looking alike.<br /><br />This one has some subtle differences. First, the 3.5mm power jack is a feature that appeals to me. As long as your phone has power you can use this stick. I cannot overemphasize how nice it is to not worry about whether the stick is charged up or not.<br /><br />The second 'improvement' that I like on this one is the ribbed grip. Some selfie sticks have smooth grips that are difficult to hold when they are wet. That brings me to the fact that I have used this one in light rain with no issues.<br /><br />My Note 3 phone is firmly held by the gripping mechanism, so it can accommodate larger phones. There is still a little extra that indicates that it could also hold a Note 4 or 5, or an iPhone 6.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest the mirror feature does not excite me. I can see the value if you want to take selfies using your phone's main camera, but for me using the self-side is more than sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, the design is the same, common selfie stick with some nice improvements. For me the biggest one is the ability to power this stick from my phone instead of worrying about a separate charging cycle. You may not be that excited about that feature, but if you do this stick may be all you need."
"It looks like a nice band and I like the clasp design, but it didn't come with any directions telling how to adjust the length of the band, nor did it come with any pins to attach it to the watch.  I hope than I will be able to use it.  The vendor, Monoy,  has been extremely helpful, and proactive, in telling me how to adjust the band.  Since the band looks great, and I am impressed with the locking mechanism, I'm changing my rating to 5 stars."
I did a bit of research before purchasing this for my iPhone 6. Have used it for close to six months now and it is one of my favorite cell phone cases ever. It's relatively slim on the phone and provides it with a surprisingly large amount of protection. I also especially like how it is mostly transparent so you still can enjoy the cool looks of the iPhone. Easy to install or take off the phone too. No issues accessing any of the buttons or the charging port at all.
Works great for my iPhone 5S. Can't beat the price.
"I bought this case about 3 weeks ago and for the most part I'm happy with it.  The screen is clear and easy to use still. Power and volume buttons all work well through the case, but the switch for silencing the phone doesn't work. I found this out the hard way missing a few phone calls and had to take the case off, switch the sound on, then carefully put the case back on without switching it back to silent. When I want to silence the phone I just turn the volume all the way down.  One other issue I have is that my Amazon iPhone charger doesn't plug in through this case, so I have to use standard iPhone charger.  Annoying, but how would they know I was going to buy a 3rd party charger? Can't really fault them for that.<br /><br />Aside from those 2 work around stage case works well. I have submerged it completely and no signs of leakage. For that reason I'm keeping the case and continuing to use it to protect my phone."
Was very easy to install and it only took me 3min to put it all together! The packaging was great in very good condition and brand new! I'd recommend this to everyone!!
"It works for my iPhone, iPad, and my android tablets. It's quite big and heavy (see the seller's picture - comparison to the iPhone), I was planning to carry it in my purse, but decide that it will be a bit too heavy). Mine cannot be charged to a 100%, 99% is the maximum that I can charge, although I did try to charge it before I even use it. The on/off button never works, so what's the point of having an on/off button? It comes with several adapter."
Hard to press the bottons but if you cut just underneath the button closest to the back it makes it so much better
Did not meet my full expectations the case holder was a bit challenging to get on and I though it would have had a more rubbery thickness to it.
"Works Like A Charm!! As soon as I received my Multi Port Charger, I started charging 5 Batter Packs.  I measured the Voltage and the Amperage of each port.  All were where they should be.  There was no drop between using just 1 port, and using 5 ports.  There was no abnormal heat buildup in the Charger, as I thought there might be.  If you have multiple devices that need charging, then this is a MUST HAVE for you."
Broke before I even got on my cell. Was wiping away finger prints and it snapped and cracked. Not worth the wait or even 10 cents.
Good price.
It does what it's advertised to do. Charges phone quickly and effectively with no issues. A great buy at a great price.
"Protects my iPhone 6.<br /><br />Very large case. If place in pocket (for a guy), get ready for some awkward stares, as I have gotten many while walking across my college's campus.<br /><br />Only real con is that dust can easily get underneath the case.<br /><br />*** Putting the case on and taking it off ***<br /><br />The case snaps into place, you need to lift and push the corner and middle clips down. When removing, you need to the same thing. People have stated that it is tedious to remove, but when doing it correctly, it isn't hard at all."
"The wire became lose within a month of having it. Not bent or broke, lose from the part that plugs in."
"I would have given this item NO stars. First of all they are NOT Apple, they look more like something you find at the dollar store, so cheap and not sturdy."
For the price of this bluetooth earpiece it's very comfortable and worth the money doesn't have all the features of my Jabra Stone but it's still well worth it. Very comfortable to wear and secure in my ear.
"This is the best cord by far I've ever owned!! Very rugged, durable and super affordable!!! I totally recommend this cord, even more so now that I plan on purchasing the 2 foot cord in a different color!!!"
"I've had this  case for several months and I've dropped my phone etc. the sticker has come off from the back but there was no sticky residue so no biggie to me. I use my phone a lot and this has kept it safe so far even through children throwing it, playing with it, and slobbering on it. This case is great."
"This product is better than the $1 or $2 chinese knockoffs, but still is prone to early failure. I bought three of these about 6 months ago, and one of them is pretty much dead, one is on its way out, and the third is still going strong.  The cable looks nice and feels like it is good quality. When they were brand new all of the devices worked seamlessly with it, but over time I could see the pins on the lightning connector start to wear off.  Bottom line: I would pay about $5 for this cable, nothing more."
"I really liked the case. The only problem, I thought i was gonna be the same as the iPhone 4 vans case made out of gum rubber. It was still a great case and everything was great about it!"
terrible 1st of all i paid for 2 day shipping and got my package in a week that not 2 day shipping and 2nd the f@$king battery was not even compatible and i made sure i read that it was compatible with my model iphone 5c don't waste your money on this crap!
"Poor quality compared to the real fitbit bands. It looks like a great value, but they all suck, also the metal part they provide is worthless."
Works great but the stand once you use it keeps popping out.  Have to use tape to hold in place so it dont pop open when walking.
"Everything fit perfectly.  Sturdy case.  The stylus is not telescopic (doesn't stretch out) and the little cord on the attachment is short so you have to detach it to use it but that is not a problem for me.  Also, the stylus tip is very soft, &#34;squishy,&#34; and hollow rather than solid.  Also not a problem for me, though.  Other reviews have mentioned paint wearing off.  I have noticed that happening a little bit along the edges but I figure, for the price, it doesn't bother me.  And it looks like it will be clear if/when the pain does wear off, and I'm okay with clear.<br />Overall, great product for a great price.  Arrive faster than expected and fit perfectly."
"Great radar detector and is very easy to use. I have owned a Cobra before and this one is just as impressive. For the price and quality, I highly recommend the Cobra XRS9470."
"This phone is another Samsung slam dunk. However, it never got 4G for T-Mobile in the US. I don't know if all unlocked phones are going to have this problem. I really liked this phone and all of the features. If you're ok with not being able to get 4G than this will work for you. I did seems to get LTE service but it wasn't fast at all. Again, this could simply be because it's unlocked international.  Great phone and it's very unique. Would definitely buy again if I knew that I could get the speed that 4G has."
"Wanted to buy the Bose wireless but was put off by the negative reviews.  For $300, they should be perfect.  Settled on this model for about $60, thinking it was a low risk gamble... boy!  Am I GLAD I DID!  Have worn them for a week solid during 4 hour commuting each day.  Great sound, comfortable for long term wearing, and a great price point for a wireless headphone that doubles for phone calls and music equally well on my Android device.  Definitely a recommendation to buy for anyone looking for clear, crisp sound quality and a comfortable fit over the ear."
"This is ridiculous the band weighs over three times what the watch does. If Skagen made the bands and Apple the watch you would have, close, to the perfect product."
"I've bought 3 of these and love them.  I plug a lot of usb devices into the one by my bed (iPhone, iPad, Bluetooth headset, Pebble watch, and often to recharge portable batteries).  So the fact that they handle various needs is wonderful.  However, one failed (apparently heat related,  if I unplugged it for an hour, it would work again, for a while, before it stopped working).  I contacted their customer service by email and included my Amazon invoice showing that it was only 6 months old, and they sent me a replacement that arrived in 2 days.  Jaimee of Photive was super helpful and I definitely would buy another Photive product.  Also, the one that failed was a 50 watt unit and the replacement was 60 watts -- apparently it's been upgraded and they sent the newer product.  Well done, Photive!<br /><br />By the way, the third unit is kept in our family room on an end table, and I keep extra charging cables in a drawer under it,  this way visitors and family can easily put their phones on charge while visiting,  and when the power goes out, I pull out a fully charged UPS, lug in the photive, and we keep our phones charged easily,  no more unplugging someone else's charging phone so MINE can get charged,"
Came on timer super great. So far they work great! Really long nice for across the room and across the car!
"My problems with this case were that I couldn't use my extra long iPhone charger cords or other iPhone chargers because of how this case is designed. I would have to take my phone out of the case daily to be able to charge it. The charging cord they send you is okay but very short and a message displayed on my iPhone saying &#34; this accessory is not supported by iPhone.&#34; After I took the case off a few times, it started to crack around the corners bad. A piece even chipped off as a result from all the cracking. If I were going to use on a float trip, or for a water sport, ( just special occasions) then it might be fine. But for everyday use , not so much."
Did wussy I needed it to do. Only wish it would protect the whole phone like a phone case
"Great customer service, but bad product design"
"Great case by Spigen, protects my iPhone 6+ perfectly.<br />I like how it looks, the buttons are easy to press, works with most lightning cables and headphones.<br />It's a but bulky though, but still looks good and feels nice. I liked the color combination, matches perfectly my space gray iPhone.<br />It can hold for 2 cards and cash perfectly, or even a 3rd card.<br />The only thing I don't like about this case is that the card slot slides VERY easy, so it slides sometimes when I take it out of my pocket or even while holding the phone, that's why I didn't gave 5 stars.<br /><br />Please remember to vote below my review if it was helpful or not helpful. If<br />you choose to vote my review unhelpful, please feel free to leave me a brief comment so I can improve my future reviews as they are important to fellow buyers like us.<br /><br />I received this product with a discount for my honest review."
used twice and wow its great and awesome only family wants me to charge there phone all the time but l told them to buy a huawei
It works.. and the door fit perfectly ***UPDATE: it quit holding a charge after a few weeks.
"Protected my phone like it should, but i was disappoited it broke when i took it off (too bulky for everyday use)"
"I was selected to review this product at a discounted rate. It took a while longer than normal to receive the product, however upon arrival I was very pleased. The case is light weight, yet cery durable. I was happy to find that it did not make my phine bulky like other cases. Overall I am very pleased."
This is a great device to charge up to 5 USB devices. Traveled in Europe with it and only needed one adapter plug (no transformer!) to charge phones and tablets. It's compact size makes it even better.
My first selfie stick ever!! It does a good selfies!!!!
Great case. Just not sure about the built in screen protector. Considering removing and replacing with one that would attached to screen. It does bounce a little.
I bought these as Christmas gifts for my family last year.  We went on a family cruise last New Years and these worked awesome!  If you are wondering if you will be able to communicate between decks and across the huge ships you can!  I have not had a use since but next cruise they will be charged and packed.  Just plan on over a day to fully charge them at least the first few times.  Used them by the pools with out the worry of them getting wet too!
Charges my phones much faster than any other wall adapter I have. Not much else to say about a wall charger. Pretty much does the one thing it's supposed to do very very well. Build quality is top notch.
This is a great case high quality leather I can't see why anyone would be disappointed.
Great mount.  Keeps GPS on dash without sliding.
"i just got the charger from the mail. i would like to say it works great and very portable. unbiased opinion this is the best portable station i ever got,"
"I have up graded my iPhone 5 but keep it and use it as a player for my audio books.  With this Horn Stand, it now is loud enough to hear without earbuds or external speaker that needs recharging.  The case protects my phone and the horn speaker works as well as a rechargeable one.  Great product!"
Phone overheated with this on. but still a good purchase.
"I just bought these two way radios for a trip on a 10 mile long lake, and we were lucky to communicate over a distance of two miles over mostly open water.  We were using the rechargeable batteries that were included with the product, and they were fully charged.  I was expecting better performance."
"Edit:  Seller contacted me and apologized for the inconvenience.  Also sent a replacement unit, which also arrived really fast and is working perfectly.  Overall very satisfied with not only the actual working product, but also the seller as well.  Wonderful customer service, and definitely will be who I look at when in need of another one.<br />Original Review: Product arrived really fast.  This review is more of a 2.5 but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Overall it's a great product and gets the job done, only issue I had with it is that one of the ports wouldn't work for me.  I bought this specifically because it had the 3rd port for an upcoming long road trip.  One for my phone, one for my ipod and one for my girlfriend to charge her phone.  Not really a big deal but it would've been nice to not have to switch the wires around while on the road."
I keep it in my travel bag and use it in rental cars.  It's easy to pack and can accommodate an iPhone 6 and even a Nexus 6.
"Had it about a week now and I think it was definitely worth the money. I like the option to switch out the back panel for different designs or colors. I also like that it has good protective corners for the inevitable times I drop my phone. There is enough of a lip around the screen to offer at least some protection against dropping face down.<br />Cons: Cannot use the phone's built in heart monitor with the case on. Also makes it slightly more difficult to get the cover off of the charger port, although not impossible."
The case worked great  for the first few weeks. The piece you pull down in order for the phone to fit broke. I thought it will be ok because I would be able to line it backup in place but nope. It no longer charges my phone. I paid less than 7.00 for it and that is the amount of use I got out of it.
"The suction cup doesn't stick to anything. I've cleaned every surface and the cup itself and tried all over my car with out any success. I did manage to find 1 spot that lasted about 24hrs before it pulled off a awkward spot on my door under the drivers side window where I managed to get it to stick, then of course it fell off at the worst possible time as I was driving and fell to the side of my seat, then moved Milameters at a time just far enough so I couldn't reach it as I was driving. So I ended up hearing my phone ring all the way back to my house because I had it hooked to my car speakers listening to music. The 1 plus of this thing is the magnet works very well, oh which reminds me, after getting this thing I slowly realized that the metal tabs that you hooked to your phone that this mount sticks to blocks your signal. I didn't realize what was going on until I back tracked the time in which my signal started messing up to the time this came in. All in all use the &#34;life hack&#34; version of the car phone mount and use a rubber band that will go through your air vent slats/grill and back out holding your phone to the air vent."
Flexible but not quite as easy to use as I hoped. Wish it had a concealed full-width zipper pocket as well.
I Like  this Headphone but if you  seed them in  for repair or  get replacement it will be a Long Time before  you get them  back. I'm still  whating for  my  to come back. If  I  what in  longer I  my  go  BandO  Company for My Headphone. I really  like  the  Headphone But  whating a Long time  repair or and replacement Thats  not  Good for me when  you  pay  this kind of money  for  high End Headphone I  was  hoping  gething repair or  replace meant to be fast
I bought thos battery in hopes it would last longer than the original one with no such luck it is just as bad. It doesn't hold up any longer. My phone has been off of the charger less than 10 minutes and I'm already down to 89%.
"The iClever IC-QC01 18W Quick Charge was meant to become an extra for my purse, because I wanted to make sure I had one when I was on the go.<br />It arrived in a box with the user manual, warranty card (1 year), the iClever IC-QC01 18W Quick Charge 2.0 Wall Charger and a 3.3ft Micro USB Cable.<br />I plugged it right in and began testing it to charge two cell phones, and a tablet. It worked with all three with no issues.<br />It charge the phones in no time at all (less than an hour) and the tablet, which was DOA, took a little over an hour. Still far faster than the charging cords that came with the devices.<br />It is a lightweight model and fits in any standard outlet. It is a compact design which allows you to use the other outlet at the same time, so it doesn't cover it.<br />It is a great design, quality materials and I feel like it will last awhile.<br />The only thing I was slightly bothered by was the length of the charging cord. With it only being 3 feet, it doesn't allow for much wiggle room or usage of the device while charging unless you are sitting next to the outlet. (which I am not). I did try a different longer cord with it and had the same awesome results as above and was able to still use the devices while charging.<br />I received this to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own!"
"It fits my tmobile note 4 but it's not hot pink at all, my volume goes down everytime I touch the side of the phone."
I HATE iPhone cases but I heard the iPhone 6 is pretty slippery. Anyway this is probably as slim as you can get while still actually getting some protection from drops. I recommend this case.
Great case. Protective without being bulky.
"As many have pointed out, this unit has some shortcomings but keep in mind, you cannot compare this low cost unit with a unit costing much, much more. Personally, I think the vx7020 is the best value out there when you compare the features to the cost. To me the radio quality seems as good as any other radio I've had but although I like to listen to the radio I am not an audiophile. I installed this to replace a dash top Garmin GPS and Jabra Tour hands free speaker, both excellent products. Like any all-in-one unit, I didn't expect this to do each function as well as the dedicated units but I was looking to reduce clutter and wires and this fit the bill perfectly.  After using it for a couple of weeks I am very happy with the purchase. Other than downloading the free map upgrade from naviextras.com (see below) I haven't found anything that I am not happy with. Like anything new it takes some getting used to but I like the nav software much better than the Garmin and haven't found any of the functions to be frustrating (like on the Garmin when I am an hour from Springfield, MA and do a search for the city 'Springfield' it comes back with a list of Springfields in Missouri, California, Texas, Montana..., and finally Massachusetts. No rhyme or reason to the order). In fact, the search and results are much better than the Garmin in my opinion. It's obviously using the same maps. There is a left turn at an intersection near my house that I take most every day. If I have set a route to follow the Garmin would tell me to go straight through the intersection, make a u-turn, then come back and take a right (like a left turn is not allowed). The vx7020 does the exact same thing.  If you are going from stand-alone units to an in-dash unit you are going to find some differences common to all in-dash units and the vx7020 is no different.. 1. Sun glare - When the sun is shining in a side window it is very difficult to see the screen. You cannot just change the angle like a dash-top unit 2. Updates -  You cannot just plug this into a USB port on your computer and run updates. As it turns out, there is a micro SD card plugged into this unit right next to the USB connection. For some reason it seems to be a big secret as it isn't highly documented. When updating the maps (free for the first time within 30 days of activating the unit) you need to remove the micro SD and use the navitools (crappy tool and worse support) to install the updates 3. Programming - If you are going to manually enter all your nav favorites, stations, etc. it is a pain to have to sit in the car rather than just taking a dash-top into your house. If you do a lot at once you are sure to end up with a sore neck from leaning over to see the screen. 4. Less clutter - The interior of your car is much cleaner without the clutter on your dash or stuck to your windshield and wires running to the power outlets 5. Integration - I love the sound integration when you get a call and it automatically cuts out the radio and announces the call. This is very comparable to units from the manufacturer costing thousands as an option in a new car.  For this Jensen vx7020 specifically: - The big problem with this unit is dealing with the naviextras.com site to get the free upgrade. What a bunch of bozos. I have Macbook and Linux computers, no Microsoft Windows. To get the upgrade you can only do it with a Windows computer using their tool. The website support and email support are extremely difficult to use due to language issues. Personally, I admire anyone who can communicate in more than one language as I only know English. But I can't believe it when a company offers tech support and doesn't care enough to hire someone fluent in the language to write a description or provide an explanation. On this site you'll find incomplete sentences, or incomplete thoughts, references to things that do not exist (&#34;See list below&#34; although there is no list below), etc. They obviously don't careabout customer support or at least not as much as saving money. That is my only rant with this product... - This is minor but frustrating - I cannot believe they do not include six to eight screws to attach support brackets if needed. Maybe the support brackets should include screws but Jensen knows the thread size required and really, would it seriously affect their bottom line if they included $.25 worth of screws?. As it is, when you get to the point of getting ready to install this you need to put everything on hold while you run down to the local hardware store for a few screws... This gives you an idea of how much I like this vx7020 when my big gripe is not getting a few cents worth of screws... - I was all set to rant that I couldn't turn off nav voice and leave the radio and phone volume on until I realized I just hadn't discovered the feature yet. Sometimes I use nav locally just to get an eta or know distances but I don't need or want the nav voice, especially with it interrupting the radio. As it turns out, you can mute just the nav through nav settings while keeping the radio on or using hands-free calling. There is also an easy 'mute all' by quickly pressing the volume knob. As it turns out, several things that I found to be lacking turned out to just need a little research to find out how to make it work. - The hands-free bluetooth has been flawless. The microphone works great and the sound comes through the speakers perfectly. - There is a frustratingly slow warning process when you start nav which basically says &#34;Don't be stupid and stare at the screen while driving&#34; which you need to acknowledge. The warning and acknowledgement only takes about 15 seconds but it happens whenever you start the nav which is any time you start your car. There is an easy fix for this though. By adding the lines below to the sys.txt file on the sd card: [debug] skip_eula=1 [interface] drive_carefully=0 This will bypass the warning and let the nav start right up.(Notice the part where drive_carefully=0=false). A big thank you to the person who included this in their review which I found along with information that an SD card exists, you saved me from a lot of frustration.  Things I'd like to see: 1. There is an option to have the screen time out and go blank if you are not on the navigation screen. It amazes me that the screen is completely blank. I would be great if a clock displayed. Every car radio I've ever seen displays the time whether the radio is on or off so I find myself looking over to the blank screen to get the time. I guess I'll get used to this but again, why not display the time, at least in a corner or something? 2. If you shut the radio off you turn off everything, including the Bluetooth speaker for the phone. My work around for this is to select a non-existent video input (to turn off the radio) and just let the screen go blank. I think it would be slicker to have the Bluetooth stay on (and display the time) when the unit is turned off. If I don't want to use the Bluetooth I can always just turn it off on my phone. 3. It would be nice to have a radio 'off' button. As it is now, if you want to turn the radio off you need to select something like 'Bluetooth' or an input that has no connection. I guess I'll get used to it but a on/off button for the radio would be a nice little feature. Obviously this would be partially taken care of by implementing my previous comment. 4. Again, you can't expect this vx7020 to have all the features of a stand-alone device but to me it is pretty basic to have the capability to use Siri or 'Hey Google' or whatever voice capability your phone has directly from the deck. In order to use Siri to dial I need to make sure my phone is handy so I can press the Siri button. It works fine through the system once Siri is awake but why not just have a button to push on the vx7020 screen to initiate Siri? Maybe I was just spoiled with this feature on the Jabra Tour. At the very least itshould accept voice commands to dial the phone hands-free. As it comes, the only way to dial your phone is to punch in the numbers on the screen or scroll through your phonebook to find it, neither one of which is a good idea to do while driving. 5. All the components are there, a microphone and speakers and nav unit. Why not make the leap and add voice commands to the unit for navigation and dialing?  Overall I think this is a great unit. When you consider the low cost it's an excellent value. It's not perfect but the deficiencies are minor. Even though there are some short-comings I'm going with a five-star rating because the cost is so low I have to overlook the few missing features.  After using this unit for over a year I wish I had spent the money to get a better unit and I've downgraded to 4 stars for the following reasons: 1. This unit is basically a computer. It runs on a Windows operating system and is frustratingly slow. Every time you start your car it takes a while for the unit to power up. I have to believe that if this was running on a Linux, OSX, IOS, android, chrome or most any other operating system it would be much faster. 2. Reason 1 would be minimized if there was an option for this to stay powered for say 30 minutes or an hour after turning off your car so that if you got out of your car for a few minutes you wouldn't have to wait for it to power back up again. If you are in a spot where you actually need the backup camera you need to sit and wait before it will come on. And the camera starts much faster than the radio or navigation. 3. There is a button on the main screen that says simply &#34;AS&#34;. The &#34;AS&#34; stands for auto search and if you hit the button it doesn't say &#34;Are you sure?&#34; or give any kind of warning, it just jumps right in and wipes out all your presets and sets them to the first stations it finds in a scan. Really? On the main screen? Not even one level down so that you wouldn't reach for your vent and accidentally wipe out all your stations??? You can be sure it wasn't a nuclear scientist that designed this 4. The navigation turns out to not be as good as Garmin or TomTom. The arrival time estimates are way off, given a choice it will pick the worse route to your destination, and like everything with this unit, it is slow - make a wrong turn and it's a frustrating wait for the route to be recalculated. 5. This has five groups or bands of presets. Two bands for AM and three for FM. If you switch from an AM station to an FM station you need to change bands. So say, just for example, you only listen to one AM station and one FM station. You are listening to your AM station and want to switch to your FM station. You need to change bands to AM2, then to FM1 and then select your station. To switch back to your AM station you need to change bands to FM2, then FM3, then AM1 and select your station. And guess what? It's a slow process to change bands. Any modern digital radio allows you to set presets to a combination of AM and FM in the same grouping.  I guess that's a lot of grips but I'll still give it four stars because it is a lower cost and I don't expect it to have the features of a higher priced unit by personally, I wish I had paid the extra money and got something that doesn't run on Windows or is better designed. It would have been a lot less frustration and more enjoyment."
The heat inside the car made the item fall apart. The magnet wont stick to the car either. The audio always has a hissing sound when connected to a device. This was a complete waste of money!
"The only thing is, when You want to use letters  at the side left or right is a little pain in the neck, to closedand the bottom to turn the phone to mute don't work"
"Is a great product, I put it to my phone as soon as arrive. Thank you guy's that was really fast."
"Excellent.  Fits my iPhone 6 perfectly.  I use it while on my sit down mower, and cycling.  Phone does not get wet when I sweat."
Looks great. But it doesn't stay on well. If you drop your phone it breaks appart and falls of the phone. Its more for looks I guess. Which is fine with me. The HTC one m8 is pretty durable itself so I'm sure it I'll be okay.
"Beautiful case.  Did not think the pen would be helpful,  but my husband finds it much easier than trying to get his big fingers on the right place.  He has some small motor control issues,  so this had really been a help!"
"iCarez has always made the best screen protectors.  I've been using their products since the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and every time I have to install a screen protector it's a very simple task.<br /><br />This time was no different, very great product by iCarez"
I have an HTC One in an Otter Defender case. The phone grips on the mount are not quite wide enough nor tall enough to hold the phone and case securely. If it was not for the rubberized pads it would not hold the phone & case at all. The part that goes into the CD slot works fine.
We bought the 3 pack and only one of the three cords included worked correctly. One of the others works if a specific side of the connector faces up. I would not purchase this brand again.
Excellent product. Works great. It's very easy to place my phone on the magnet and it hold very well.
"This is the ONE BEST accessory I have ever owner for my iPhone and LOVE IT. I would NEVER go without one, now that I have used it. It does EVERYTHING that is promised, easy to use, fits perfectly in a case brand I use (one size larger then previous), protects my phone, prevents me from hitting darn buttons by accident, looks and feels like a typical case...on and did I mention the BEST and MAIN reason I got it....I can go a whole day and sometimes still be at 100% reading on my Phone!!!! Prior, it would NEVER make it through a day with out a booster charge or two!! This device for your phone (for all compatible models) is a MUST HAVE ACCESSORY. I hate even to use the word accessory. It should ne a NESSISITY. I STRONLY recommend this to all that seek more (REALLY MORE) battery power, that will make a small fingerprint in size, real easy on the wallet and is built with high quality to last...and it still looks so good....make may phone look better with added protection! You can't go wrong. And this seller is fantastic!!! I will always but this one from this seller via Amazon!"
"Good speaker, very easy to use. Super loud for indoors or a small outdoor space. I was looking for something louder for a large indoor space.<br />But good, solid speaker.<br />Seller was great!!!"
I love this case! The only reason I gave it a four star is cause trash easily gets under the screen protector and have to take it apart to get it out!! Fix please!!!
"I used the item once. While on my first ride, I hit a bunch going 16mph and one of the arms holding the phone popped off.  Because I was in a huge pack I couldn't go back and get it so after one use I am left with a dysfunctional mount holder.  I will also say that I continually had to re-adjust the phone due to any light road bumps causing it to move in a different position.  I would not recommend this brand. I don't know if a more expensive one will be better."
Charge Iphone 5 more than 3 times and Ipad 4 once
"I like the fact that it give you privacy and it's easy to put on. I did have to cut a small piece where the light blanks on my phone In order to see it better ( galaxy s5) but other than that, I enjoy my screen."
"Made cheap,looks cheap...will never use"
"One word GARBAGE!  Not for Samsung galaxy Note4.  I come to realize if these did work they woudnt be the price that they are.  Scratched my phone case cover and I think possibly the lens, bringing to my wireless provider to check if indeed it has a scratch. Dont be stupid all these reviews are BS! Probably paid to give good reviews!"
The long cable along with its illumination is just what I was looking for... Great product!
"I have had this stereo for a few months. The bluetooth works seamlessly once paired. It will even control pandora.  It works great from a sd card. I have had a little trouble with the usb but had to reformat it and works fine. The only thing missing is an external microphone, when driving people have a hard time hearing me because it is internal to stereo."
The case was really nice when I got it and didn't take that long to get to my house. The rubber raps around the front of the case which I like a lot. The only problems I had with the case were that the back of it is made of fabric so strings start to hang off the case and you have to cut them off or go over them with a lighter quickly to get rid of them.
Rugged and stylish. Perfect case that lasted for a long time.
runs a little small<br />perfect condition<br />Thank You!
Great quality.  Very solid construction and a rubberized texture.  The volume is loud enough to use on conference calls etc.  The battery life is great also; about three days if I leave it on accidentally.  I almost dropped $100 on a Jawbone but glad I took a chance on this one.  I don't know if the Jawbone is louder etc. but this performs to the level I need it so I am happy.
Real Happy with this purchase......have used it to charge up tablet then phone and had plenty to spare.......Very cool battery.
I've had this headset for a few weeks now and I love it! Great range. So much better than a previous high-end brand I had and returned. Earbuds occasionally fall out but I've found If I just turn them the stay in perfectly.
"It'd be nice to be able to activate voice commands from this device, but overall the product works as intended."
"Great wallet and phone case....at first. Phone case deteriorated quickly. The wear on the case showed within a week, but I mostly ignored it. Then about a month in the case started getting cracks with the smallest amount of pressure, even just from taking it out(never dropped it). Maybe I just got a bad one? But the wallet is great! Sometimes it won't clasp with the phone if you have too many coins in the zipper part, but otherwise it's solid."
Good case ..but it does not protect all the phone ..top and bottom is unprotected !! Nevertheless looks good quality !
"This massive behemoth is able to charge my phone and tablet two times each. It is amazing however a little inconvenient to carry around, so it's inordinately for over night trips."
"Excellent to charge 2 simultaneous devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops while traveling in a car."
D.O.A ! enough said returned.
"This case is great, easy to get things in and stays put.  I was surprised I could get as many cards, at least 4.  A must have if you need to carry license, cc, room key, and some cash."
Excellent but the upper part after some time will not close properly so I had to remove it<br />Charging is excellent
Great product and cheap price. Nice protection.
Even though it takes a long time to arrive I really liked the case it was just what I wanted thank you.
"The installation was easy and the case provides great protection! You will NOT find a better case at this price, bar none. The kickstand is a nice bonus, though I rarely use it."
"Works great, but if you let it get hot the plastic circle will warp and the suction cup won't stick anymore. Definitely use a sunshade."
"OtterBox.  Always a great option. Defender is bulky, but worth protection."
Stopped working in less then a month.  Too late to return to amazon.  Now I have to ship it back to garmin with prepaid postage for them to ship me a new one.  BOO!
"Really well done, especially considering the price. Watch holds well. Nice stand for iphone six. Stable. Looks good. Surprisingly inexpensive."
Nice case. Good material. Phone still retains a good feel. It also comes with a screen protector so the phone feels like it is shielded well.
"I'm unable to get this thing to charge any of my phones.  Since I made the mistake of throwing away the packaging, I'm stuck with this POS.  I got curious and opened it up.  If the coils are placed directly against the back of a phone, it will charge, but assembled normally, it won't charge.  The fatal flaw of this thing is that it's really bad at detecting when a Qi device is near either of the coils.  With the unit disassembled and the coil directly against the back of a phone, the charging rate is comparable to other Qi chargers... but this is of no use when the unit can't detect a Qi enabled phone in normal operation."
Great backup for when AC isn't available. This battery will recharge an iphone6+ several times. It is heavy.
I like the overall design of the case.  The kickstand folds out from the case in an a-frame design and seems to hold in place well.  I would like to see a higher quality material used to make the case so it is a little more  rugged.
"Have problems with some of the cords working between my iPhone and PC. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.  All cords worked fine for charging with Ac/Dc adaptors. Also fits very well with Otter waterproof cases!  HottCell C/S very good in replacing cords, and following up."
Nice to have the buttons open very thin should offer some protection in minor drops.
Piece of crap! Mine never worked.  What a waste of money. I followed the direction and it never worked at all.
Got this for my boyfriend.  He loved it.  He is an auto mechanic so the case had to be tough to withstand being at his job.  It's been a month and the case still looks brand new
"No, not for your wrists! (box cutter or razor blade!)<br /><br />While the colour of this case is fabulous you will not be able to pull down the top of your phone's screen. If you're sick of whatever you have there then this may be the case for you. Unless you feel like attempting to cut a strip about the thickness of a penny off the top of the snap-on cover piece. I myself am not fond of working with very sharp objects in small places. Especially when it's likely to leave a sharp edge. Though...  I do have lots of bandaids at home. But bloody fingers is really not a fashion statement that would work for me.<br />Oh wait! I almost forgot. If you want an impact resistant case this is not for you either. Unless you are feeling your phone is a despicable device you wish you'd never bought. Smashing it should be easy.<br />My case is going back."
I have used his case since prime day and it has held up amazingly. I have dropped my phone and it has been well protected and the case looks as good as new. I love always having my ID and CC close. Only thing that would make it better is if it was easier to open and close the case. It gets stuck closed and makes it difficult to open at times- often when there is a line behind me. If there was a button or latch that would make it more user friendly.
"Bought this after Studio Energy.... no update, no customer response. My advice no more business for Blu from me."
"Just got a new iPhone 6 and had to replace all of my old power cords for my 4S. Needed multiple cords to stage in car, office, bedroom, etc, etc. I tried multiple other vendors but was shocked to see how almost all of them didn't work or failed shortly after I got them. Tech Armor you can tell is of much greater quality. It's used in my office through my desk and gets yanked and stretched daily, but is the best cord I have. Highly recommended."
For some reason it keeps getting moisture inside the tube. I work inside a constant 70 - 72 degree building / jail. I then have to take it off for the rest of the day till I get compressed air and blow it out.
"very durable. i also get many compliments<br />the front lower-right brand label thing is actually a sticker, so i removed mine"
Great price and shipped early. The only problem I've encountered is the wire casing came out from under the phone charging end cap. Still works great so I'm not complaining.
"The Vysk charging case for the iPhone 6 has 4 main attributes (style, privacy, charging, protection) that I'll review separately. I did not use any of the apps associated with Vysk, so I'll ignore those entirely.<br /><br />Styling: The case is very attractive with small chrome accents and a pleasant texture that gives just enough grip so that the phone doesn't feel like it will slip out of your hand. Overall very classy.<br /><br />Privacy: The main reason to consider buying this phone is its camera privacy feature. The slider at the back of the phone engaged easily and never opened accidentally. I love this feature and wish every phone case had this. Outstanding.<br /><br />Charging: If you're knowledgable enough about potential smartphone exploits to be concerned about camera privacy, then you probably realize using an encrypted VPN (at all times) is even more important. And that uses even more power from your phone, hence the need for extra power. But the charging capability of this phone is just ok. I don't like the fact that the case had to be fully charged before it would charge the phone via the power cord. The charger is better than nothing, but a disappointment if you are used to Mophie or Otterbox chargers.<br /><br />Protection: This is the biggest flaw, in my opinion. The case slips on very easily, in fact, too easily. The Mophie case slips on in a very similar way, but is a much tighter fit. This helps when you drop the phone. My phone flew out of the Vysk case when it dropped from a &#34;normal&#34; fall onto concrete. The case seams also appear to be starting to separate after the fall. Ultimately, after closely examining my Vysk, my wife's Mophie, and my son's Otterbox Resurgence, it is clear the  quality of manufacturing is lower with the Vysk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'll be switching to the Otterbox Resurgence (harder on/off, but doesn't come off when you drop it). The lack of camera privacy shutters really bothers me after enjoying the heightened privacy bar with Vysk. However, I look forward to seeing if Vysk will match the quality construction of Mophie and Otterbox in the future, as well as attaining a better internal grip of the phone. It's a good start, nevertheless."
This is my second Maxboost case.  The first case was with my iPhone 6 which it is still in use after 9 months.  I got this case to go on my work phone which is a 5S.  It fits perfectly and really looks good.  You can't go wrong with this case.
"It reminds me of the material used around the Gorilla cases built to protect your phone, which makes me think it can take some abuse. "
Really like these covers easy to put on.. Just make sure u get them on right the first time.. They don't do so well if u have to pull them up..but they work very well.
i love it  i have had it for 2 weeks now and it has not faded like others state here i guess its just how u takr care of it
"I like this it works great and holds my IPhone 6 Plus however I think the phone is to heavy for the ball and socket connection as it is continuously falling forward, I am going to try to enlarge the ball by putting some electric tape around it as it is just loose enough that it is a nuisance when I am riding my bike, I would recommend it but be aware the ball and socket may not be strong enough to hold the larger phones up"
"I just received this product 2 days ago and I finally have a chance to use it today. The materials seems so-so, fitting with the price. The color is more of jet black rather than a gunmetal gray, which is to be expected. It still looks better on my gunmetal sport watch than the apple official milanese loop band since the official version only comes in gray. The magnet seems strong and would last for a while. What bothers me is that the band does not fit my 42mm Sport Edition gunmetal watch that I specifically order (see pictures). Luckily, my wife the 38mm and I put it on her watch and it fits it perfectly. I deduced that they sent me the wrong version (38mm) without checking prior to shipment. Who is in charge of quality assurance? I would not be surprised if all previous reviewers who received the band with a gap also received the wrong 38mm version. So either: 1) it was an accidental shipping error where a 38mm band was shipped instead of the 42mm or 2) the seller falsely claimed that they produce a 42mm but they really don't. I read at least one reviewer who mentioned that he received the band without a gap so I assume that there are 2 versions produced. I have submitted for a return request so let's see how the seller will respond and I will keep this review updated accordingly.  REVIEW UPDATED 9/10/2015 Seller promptly responded back to me and offered to replace with the correct 42mm black milanese loop. For my trouble, I asked the seller to send me a silver 38mm Milanese loop for my wife silver Sport band and the seller agreed to send it for free. A week later, I received both bands and they fit both the 42mm and 38mm really well. The 42mm is ever slightly larger than the watch connector but you can only see this if you closely examined it. To the standard observer, it fits perfectly. The 38mm band fits the 38mm sport watch perfectly. My wife loves it! The materials seem durable and the magnet is surprisingly strong. I would highly recommend purchasing the Milanese loop from Kartice due to the excellent customer service and the great value that you get from these Milanese loop."
"I placed my phone in this case, a couple of weeks later I removed the top part in order to clean my phone and the entire screen came off with it. Would not purchase again. iPhone 5S."
This case fits like a glove.  Very nice!
"The only reason it's a 4 star rating because my cable failed after just two months, but I'm able to return it back for refund. I'm still an anker fan. I think I may have received the defective one."
Great basic speaker - love that I can use as both a light and the blu-tooth speaker. LED color is a very cool white (blue) so used more for speaker! Teen actually stole mine - this has been a hit for all ages. I received this at a deeply discounted price for my honest opinion.
"These are awesome. They really give that Xtra kick, nice clean sound. The way they are designed make them hard to damage with sound like other speakers. I'm looking for the other 2 from the from of my car now....."
"I got mine really fast. Its not what i expected it to be, it does not covers the top and the bottom fully, i mean it does not covers the headset jack or the microphone neither the USB connector, it is only covers the left and right side of the phone, and on the right side it covers around the power and volume buttons."
Definitely protects. I've dropped my phone few times and it's safe. It is bulky so some may not like that feature. I don't mind
No issues
"I like this phone case because it's very sleek. I hope that it is shock absorbant as advertised, seems a bit stiff. otherwise great product."
Great product. Earpieces could have more sizes to fit.
Great case for my active lifestyle. Fit my s6 active perfectly.
"Very nice, sturdy case. Love the strap. Keeps me from dropping phone. Wish it had a slot for a stylus."
Would have preferred that the protection screen was on when it arrived and the speaker protective grill wasn't on so I had to get it fixed
Very tough. Very good screen protector. Quick shipping and reasonable price. Thank you !
I have had this phone a little over a year and it will not hold a charge.  Junk!
"Part 1:<br /><br />Previous batteries that were cheap OEM knock offs would get really hot when the GPS was in use and battery life would suffer. The reviews on Anker looked promising so I decided to try one for myself.<br /><br />I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 version and it arrived today. Compared to the OEM battery it's a tad bit thicker but the battery cover snaps on easily.<br /><br />It registered a 40% charge out of the box, which is perfect for storage. Enclosed documentation stating Anker has a very high interest in customer satisfaction was a nice touch. It included a toll free support number.<br /><br />The literature states 500 charge cycles, so it should be able to hold a full charge for at least a year. Many manufactures don't publish this information and if it does hold for the full 500, that would put it on par with actual OEM quality at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />No issues with heat or charge duration within the first day of use (it seems to be the same as OEM,) so I'll post back.<br /><br />Part 2:<br /><br />It's been three weeks and I noticed that it consistently holds a charge equivalent to the original Samsung battery. For me, that's about 14 hours of moderate usage with low signal strength. The battery doesn't get as hot as the cheap $5 replacements, which is really nice. It still heats up when the processor is working hard, but it's just warm and doesn't feel like it's going to explode at any moment.<br /><br />Edit 3:<br /><br />I noticed the battery was only holding 70% of its original charge so I contacted customer service. They promptly addressed my concerns and the battery was replaced under warranty. Very impressive customer service!"
"The biggest complaint I hear about this product is that it's ugly and uncomfortable...Neither are true! It's extremely comfortable on my wrist and with the adjustable strap, it's perfect! I got my package yesterday and immediately opened it, charged it, and put it on! I'm in love with this fitness tracker already. Great accuracy with step tracker, calorie burn, and so much more. As a previous owner of the Nike Fuel band I was skeptical of anything else but so glad my Fuel band broke and I got to purchase this! Microsoft is stepping up in the world!"
I loved the color and the fit but they just didn't stay connected. I ended up sending them back and getting something else. It's a pain in the rear to be running and having your music constantly cutting out.
"This is a great case ! Received it today and am very pleased with the quality. It is probably a better case than ones I've seen in Walmart and target for 4 times the price. Well worth the money spent. I would certainly recommend to anyone. As for anyone saying it makes the phone bulkier, not really. It's a big phone. If you think the case makes it to bulky then you should have gotten a smaller phone."
"Finn is a fantastic product for mounting your phone to your bike. I've been cycling seriously for fitness, commuting and travel for over 30 years and there have been so many exciting changes in cycling technology in that time. One of the most exciting and most recent has been the ability to use a smartphone as a cycling computer. Finn is the simplest, easiest to use, and best solution I have found to mount my NEXUS 5 to each of the three bikes I ride. I have used the Finn for months with no signs of wear to it or my phone. While I originally thought the Finn might break my phone in half, it really does a great job of holding the phone very securely without applying damaging pressure. It is very easy to read the various cycling all's I have used as well as other apps like Google maps for turn-by-turn directions - a real joy on camping trips in new places! My only problem with the Finn is that I lost my first one and had to live without it for a week. There are other solutions out there. Many are more expensive, require tools, add weight, leave plastic mounts on your bike and/or phone, can only be used with one bike, cause your phone to overheat, etc. Finn is the way to go."
"This case fits the OnePlus One phone perfectly.  I think that it will protect the phone in the event of it being dropped, which is why I purchased it.  (I hope not to find out if it will, I hope I will not drop it!!)  Following the directions, the case is easy to install, and the screen saver protects from scratches to the screen.  The only issue that I have experienced is a relatively minor one, but is a little frustrating.  The hinged snap in protector for the charging port does not easily &#34;snap&#34; into place, and pops open too often, especially when moving the phone into or out of your pocket, for example. It is a good value, but it would be nice if the port cover would work correctly."
"For the price, I can't believe how long it's lasted me already! Easy to use. Works great!"
Just got mines today and it's great. Better than what I expected. Will be buying more of these soon. Thank you so much.
I bought a second one of these as a gift.  It has all the features I like.
"I purchased this for a Samsung Note 3 which has a low profile case. It's just too gooey and the slot is too short to hold a bigger phone. The phone falls every time I turn a corner but the pad stays on the dash without sliding around. I wouldn't use this to hold my phone face up on the dash because we get a lot of sun in our area and it would probably fry my phone.<br />It works great to hold my husbands iPhone 5s, my sunglasses and other items and if that's what I had purchased it for I would give it a 4."
My fault for buying a hard case. It lasted about 5 months. I dropped my phone in the kitchen and the case cracked. Do yourself a favor and get a rubber or silicone case.
I love it 💜 great case with a great clear image fits snug on my phone.what u see is what u get
"Works exactly as it should.  indicator light let's you know when it's done charging,  and charging a dead battery only takes about 5-6 hours. I haven't had a problem yet,  after 3 weeks of everyday use"
There's a lot of good reviews for the suede leather band so I made the purchase. However the black leather band looks cheap flimsy. I think it's far the from quality of the apple leather band that I tried on.
"I have used so many car-phone mounts that I should have 1 on every window in my car... I even use them in my house while cooking and even on the nightstand next to my bed. I like this one because it gives you the convenience of having your phone within eye shot without having to disrupt your view of the road. There are already way too many distractions to add one more just to hold your phone.<br /><br />It came with several different rubber pieces to use on the part that actually goes into your CD player, depending on the thickness of the CD opening. Though the instructions for this product didn't really make it clear what those pieces were for. There was only 1 place on the box that showed the different sizes. I do like this product and will continue to use it as I like the fact that it's not an additional distraction on the windshield but I wished the screen on my stock radio was in a different place. It only blocks a part of the display but I don;t think it will be like that in most vehicles.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this product!<br /><br />*I was given this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion*"
"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn’t interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
Awesome product.  Fits and looks great!
"I used to have an Otterbox for my phone, but the problem was it was a black case and was CONSTANTLY losing my phone. This case it 100% comparable to the Otterbox I had and for less than half the price when I purchased it. Also, I don't lose my phone anymore because it's neon green!"
"Awesome cover.  I got this for my 13year old for Iphone 5s.  For myself I am a HTC fan and have had cases for HTC M7 and M8.  SPECK is the only phone cover I will ever buy.  If SPECK doesn't make a cover for the phone, I'm not buying the phone is how strong I feel about the quality of SPECK covers.  The phone honestly will bounce with the cover on, without doing any damage to the phone.  It has a slight lip that is slightly higher than the glass so not matter how the phone falls the phone is protected.'<br /><br />The color in the picture is the color of the case that we received.  To protect the screen while her phone is in her backpack/soccer bag she also has the:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/UPPERCASE-iPhone-Protector-Premium-Tempered/dp/B00HMCHUCU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440892932&sr=8-1&keywords=UPPERCASE+iPhone+5s%2C+iPhone+5%2C+iPhone+5c+Protector%2C+Premium+Tempered+Glass+Screen+Protector+for+iPhone+iPhone+5s%2C+iPhone+5%2C+iPhone+5c%2C+4.7%22+Screen+-+Transparent"
"The iPhone came defective. The Wi-Fi adapter is not working, so I tried to contact Apple but they could not help. This was a bd gift for a relative but when the day of the bd came and the iPhone was opened it was already too late for a return or refund. The iPhone was returned to me and well, the seller deserves less than one start for messing up a special birthday present."
Didnt fit
"Great charger,  but first few hours the led display,  the center line across the led will no longer light up. *update* Parts of the display do not light up anymore. When I got a call about thfae product, I told them of the issue but they would not do anything for me. If you call to check then do something to fix the problem.,"
"Great lil' speaker. Sound is really good for the size and price. Works great on my back deck when streaming music thru my phone. No issues as of yet with the Bluetooth connectivity not working and it synced up in a snap. Actually like the fact the volume is controlled only by the phone, and it is plenty loud enough. Great product so far."
Great case! My heart rate monitor has had a long life since I bought this case for the watch and the monitor strap.
"I bought this for the Honor X2 made by Hauwei. It arrived before the scheduled date so the shipping is expedient.<br /><br />The case also comes with a screen protector. That is good in case the one already on the X2 becomes damaged. Be sure to look closely at the X2 screen, it comes with a factory installed screen protector so don't add another on top of it.<br /><br />The back of the case is real leather, a sample patch is attached so you can see that. I noticed that the corner of the leather back near the camera cutout was peeling off. It isn't a big deal to put some glue on it but something the manufacturer should pay some attention to.<br /><br />To install the case. slide the leather cover downward so that you have two pieces, the back and the metal surround. Insert the X2 with the side buttons portion going in first followed by the opposite side. Then slide the leather back cover in. The case does what it says and is very stylish and provides a nice grip. It makes the X2 look very high end.<br /><br />Here are the issues though and for me it is a deal breaker sorry to say:<br /><br />1. Any case will increase the bulk of a phone but with the X2 aleady being on the large side, the extra bulk is just enough to make it too large for me to carry around. It isn't that it doesn't fit into pockets, it still does but it just is a bit too large to hold. I don't say this is the fault of the case, all cases will make whatever they hold larger. Just keep this in mind. If you use the X2 differently, say carry it in a purse or something like that and primarily use it as a tablet instead of a phone for making calls, that extra size is just a bit too much.<br /><br />So #1 applies only to me.<br /><br />#2 though is hard to deal with. I noticed that the X2 gets better reception without the case than with it. I use T-Mobile and can consistently get very fast 3G speeds, so good that for practical purposes, 4G isn't any faster or doesn't make a real life difference. Perhaps itis the metal used in the frame but the instant I take the case off the 3G reception gets much better. I don't know where the antennas for the X2 are placed but this is something I noticed.<br /><br />I must say though, since the Honor X2 is designed for the Asian market, this reception issue might not happen in locations where 4G works with the X2. Since I am using the X2 in the USA and get 3G service with it, that might be the problem. If you are in a location where the 4G frequencies work with the X2, then you might not experience this problem.<br /><br />In summary, I chalk this up to 1-personal preference and 2-my location which is not where the X2 was designed to operate. I point these things out because some people like me are buying the Honor X2 for the US market.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars because the design of the case is nice, it is well made except for that one small issue which could be isolated to my one example."
"POSITIVE:<br />* Works well on Verizon.  The nano SIM from my Verizon iPhone 6 works perfectly with this Nexus 6.  I have the XT1103 version purchased from Amazon.  The product description incorrectly states that it doesn't work on Verizon.<br />* GPS navigation works well using Nokia HERE maps while offline (on airplane mode while location services is on).<br />* Quick charger works well and is fast.<br />* Vanilla Android.<br /><br />NEGATIVE:<br />* Curved back is comfortable for holding with one hand, but it makes it less stable in car phone carriers.<br />* Battery life is short.  Good thing the quick charger works well.  You should also get a good vehicle quick charger (e.g., Anker PowerDrive+ 1).<br />* Android is still not as smooth functioning as iOS. This is not Nexus 6 specific, but it's still worth noting."
"The one I got looked different then the picture. I though the case was gonna be black. It was a clear, thin plastic that felt like it was going to break when I tried to put it on. The print of the case looked old and discolored. The while lettering looked yellow. Was very disappointed with this case."
"I love this case! It is a light and durable minimalist case. The orange trim is fun, and the clear back really highlights the elegance of your iPhone without covering it. The material is very grippy, so I never feel like my phone will slip out of my hand. There is sufficient coverage around the entire face of the phone (no corners uncovered) so if I set it down face-first the case (and possibly my screen protector) are the only points touching. I gave it 4 stars only because the edge of the case separated along the back of the phone after many months of use. But I like the case so much that I ordered another one - same exact one and same exact color. I think it is good value for the money."
"Came with various fittings to accommodate a  comfortable fit. They hold up on runs and workouts, and they've lasted me over 3 hours on a single charge. A little too much bass for my taste but it was still a great buy"
"I love this case. I have the black edged case for my white Note 4 and it's a perfect fit. I had a similar case for my Galaxy S4 in the past that had a rigid side edges for extra grip. I wish this case had that but that's me being nit picky. This case has protected my phone from a couple falls already.<br /><br />The Note 4 is pretty bulky to begin with in my opinion so I really wanted a case that didn't add to that preexisting bulk. This case does well. After about 10 months of use, it still holds up great."
"Great fit, just like all the paat Spigen products I've ordered. This case has been protecting my phone for over four months now and haven't had any issues. I do construction so the phone has been put through a lot. Drops, falls, being stepped on and dust. Thus cast has protected it perfectly. Cannot go wrong with Spigen if you're looking for a less bulky case than Otter Box."
"Great case at a great value!  Slimmer than the Otterbox case, but just as protective.  Some slight rainbow effect from screen saver, but you can only see it when the screen is off.  Rainbow is not visible when the screen is on."
I really like this case! The kick stand is a little cheap but I don't think I'll use it anyways. The case seems really protective and has a high lip around the screen.
"Wow what a great thing.  We've replaced the battery in our car three times over the last six months (the car is a 2010 model).  The dealership couldn't find the cause and said the only thing they could think of was that the smart key was always communicating with the car so we needed to move the key further from the car when we're not driving.  We couldn't find anywhere in the house that there was no communication, so, in desperation, I ordered the signal blocking bag.  Works like a champ!  No signal even if we're in the car.  Amazing."
It is a very good product for the price.  I even brought one for my grand daughter and she love it. Easy to setup the Bluetooth.
"Did all the prep work (clean, microfiber, dust removal) and this baby went on absolutely perfectly. Not a single bubble or speck of dust. Never had a screen protector apply itself so well. Also looks great and touch response is unaffected. Couldn't be happier."
"Best lightning cable out there, This has traveled constantly over the last 13 months, still works perfectly.  I would call this super heavy duty."
"The protection is great. Dropped my phone face down on concrete. The protective film cracked, but not my phone. Now my issue is the &#34;life time warranty&#34;, I've called and sent an email, no returned call, as the message says, and the email address is no good. So now what??perhaps this is the only way to get their attention. If there is a guarantee for replacement. I would like a replacement please."
"I ordered this as a back up case because I have had a phone case design peel off the plastic shell and I was nervous to get a new one from amazon, but I love my new case and the purple back up rubber case is exactly what I ordered."
"Don't waste your time installed it right and followed instructions, now all i get is a beeping noise from phone. Waste of time and money. I want a refund but good luck getting that"
"Love the phone,  was every thing I heard. I would suggest you buy one. For the money, it will be hard to find better deal. One of best sounding I ever had."
we used it on two recent trips.  lasts forever on one charge. we charged 2 iPads and 2 iPhones 3x...
Top skin came off wit first use of first two pens. OK as pens not good as a stylus
"I was initially unsure about buying a phone from anyone other than my carrier. I wanted this phone, however, and it was no longer available through my carrier. Amazon customer support helped me on the phone, making me feel 100% comfortable going outside my comfort zone. I LOVE my phone. It arrived in perfectly new condition, there were absolutely NO ISSUES. Thank you Amazon customer support!!"
Nice slim design  and fits like a glove..
Worked for one day then can't pair it anymore. Followed all the &#34;tips&#34; no help. Trying to find contact info is impossible...
"No problem!  I ordered it, got it in a timely fashion and that was all I needed."
"The case is great but I wish that I could find it without the holster.  I bought a similar case without the holster for my iPhone 6+ Last November, bit I couldn't find it on Amazon when I went to find the same case for my wife's phone.  Regardless, the case is worth getting and just throwing away the holster, which I did."
"This cover fit my phone like a glove. It is slim, but not so thin that your phone would break if you dropped it. It is sleek but not slippery. I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"
"POS that Amazon should be embarrassed to allow it to be listed for sale on their site.  Does not fit 04 Tacoma without cutting the dash due to the long depth in spite of being stated as &#34;fits your vehicle&#34; when make and model is entered in the pop up,  The calendar function day/date function is wrong which is amazing since that is the easiest module for a programmer to write, the clock refuses to maintain a time setting so the prominently displayed time is what ever it feels like displaying. The trim piece included wouldn't even fit the unit the injection molding was so bad.<br />Worst part is the seller Boss was totally unresponsive to submitted  questions regarding the programming flaws and then after four weeks had the gall to ask in a email how they were doing for customer service.<br /><br />The radio, backup camera input, and playing music files from the sd micro card did function.  If those are the only items you need and don't mind the wrong day-date and time being displayed you could take a chance on it how ever it may be doubtful you will get any  service if it blows out during the factory warranty period.  Take note some of the &#34;good&#34; reviews do not state they had installed it yet. Research it on the web at other locations before purchasing."
This one Crashes often. Please see the attached pic..Also Slow response and also the pictures taken by both the cameras are of low quality .
"The phone case itself is really pretty and protects my phone (iPhone 6) just fine. However I think the color is a little different from the picture. I believe the one I received is lighter pink. It is very slippery and slips from my hand very easily.It also got very dirty quickly and I could not clean it. Again, it does serve its purpose as a phone protector."
Works great and never falls out but anytime I move mty phone more than a few inches it cuts out for a second.
This is a great product. Easy to install and adjusts to fit all sorts of devices. My kids love not having neck ache at the end of long trips now. We have left it installed all summer without any issues.
"The charging cord broke within a week of using it.  It takes a long time to charge the charger back up, but it is good for numerous uses.  It tends to stop charging at random times at like 75% or 80% (doesn't always charge to full) even without running out of battery.  Basically, this is a good extra option."
"Stopped working after 2 months, will no longer charge iPad.  Pay the extra money and buy a better cable, Do not buy this item, it will be a waste of money."
This is very nice phone.  Works well and the price for a new one was very attractive
This screen protector includes the standard 9h glass that is expected of a glass screen protector.  The problem is that this screen protector only covers the lit portion of the screen.  This makes use of the phone very uncomfortable as the lip between the screen protector and the rest of he glass on the front of the phone is noticeable.
"I personally don't own an iPhone 6+ (let alone any iPhone), but I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn't make up their mind about which case to get. That being said, they were naturally happy to receive this case because it afforded them the quality of an OtterBox case to an extent without costing as much. What makes this case even nicer, is that it has swappable plates so he can change it depending on his mood."
"Great leather, however color brown was a not good choice to make.....wife did not like it....."
"I was in between many iPhone 6 armbands and I chose this one because it seems like it is more likely to fit my iPhone 6 WITH its case in it. And GREAT news...IT DID! I was so thankful that I didn't have to take my phone out of the case and put it in the armband. My only complaint is that the material is bit flimsy compared to all my previous iPhone 4, 5, iPod Touch, etc. armbands I bought in the past. I'm not sure how long it will last, but hopefully until the next iPhone comes out!"
"Easy application for my pebble time. No bubbles, clear coating, great peace of mind now that my screen is protected!"
"Great case.  I bought this because most of the other cases out there have an extra layer that the phones attaches to, and then the case attaches to that layer.  This one is different in that the back of the phone fits exactly into the case: there's no extra flap.  These phones are big enough now-a-days, and I have this only as a necessity, not out of choice. (Prefer the old nokias and smaller, slimmer phones of the past.)<br /><br />The tit is EXCELLENT, slim and professional.  There are cutouts-- when opened-- to allow for easy access to the microsd charging flap, the magnetic charging port and the lower sim card flap.  The only reason this case cannot receive 5 stars is because the inner cover lining is some kind of soft fabric: a light-coloured grey.  Because of that it picks up dirt like nobody's business.  I have had around 30 cell phones, and I kid you not: this case is the worst one in terms of showing dirt. It is also &#34;wearing&#34;, as in, getting pilly like a winter sweater would.  This is after owning it for a month. If the inside was a black fabric, or a simple textured plastic like the outer case there'd be no issue, however opening up the phone and seeing a dirty, uncleanable flap is unappealing.  One more thing, the inner spine of the case is also showing wear and picking up light black coloring from the case itself, either that or it is &#34;waering&#34; down and showing the black underside.<br /><br />I don't want to scare you, just giving as much info as possible.  I like crisp and clean, the fit is crisp and clean.  The inside of the case, not so much.  If you are a snacker or have dirty hands in your profession or personal life this may not be the case for you.  If you want a case that fits snugly and professionally this is definitely the case for you."
"I dont not think it is OEM, but it works fine just the same."
"With this mount & Filmic Pro running on my iPhone 6 plus, I now have another great camera added to my gear.  Great mount holds the phone snug.  Would buy again.  Thanks for making it!"
"This case is a good case. Lets get that clear. But, there are some glaring problems that they really need to solve before you buy this.<br />First, the biggest problem. The sides of the case are not tight, and the back came scratched. The scratches hide a little when you put a black custom back on it, but it really could come unscratched."
"Beware! They don't last! Purchased one in 2014. Stopped working afte at few days. Amazon replaced it per their return policy. The second unit lasted a few months past Amazons return date policy. I tried contacting the manufacturer to no avail. Real shame. When the unit worked, it worked very well and sounded great. Probably one of the best sounding earbuds on the market."
The &#34;kick stand&#34;  broke after a short period of time.  Otherwise the case has been just fine.
Received quickly! Really like the case.
This case has already saved my poor phone from what could have been several catastrophes. I am very pleased with this product.
This is a really good case .durable and fits in the belt clip great I have put a lot of wear and tear on it and it is doing fine.
"They're decent replacements.  I got these for my iPhone 6 Plus and the 6ft one has started to not charge my phone very fast when I connect it to the USB port in my car stereo.  The others seem to be fine so far.  Today I tried using the 6ft one one that was messing up and it only went up about 3% within 30 minutes so I guess I'm done with that one.  On other cables I used to get a message saying about the accessory may not be supported when I would connect it to my car stereo but these don't.  Except once I did but it was with the 6ft one.  Just a faulty cable I suppose.<br />I love the lengths though, especially coming in a 3-pack.  They feel thicker than most cheap iphone cables I've bought though so it seems like you're buying something a little more durable."
Great packaging and super easy to apoly to my phone:)
Really nice comfy headphones. Sink up to my phone easy. Sound quality is actually really good.
"Works great in my 07' Tacoma. The sound quality is as good as I could hope for, w/ loud bass. Finally allows me to plug in my ipod directly w/o using a radio adapter."
Very helpful on a very long road trip!  Didn't have to worry about suction cups losing their grip and flying off the dash or window! Use it everyday!
Excellent product. It never gets warm ko matter the gadget you connect. Ihace charged 2 samsung 1 ipad and a extra battery and did it in a good time.
"Great product, excellent  protection for my new phone."
"Bought OEM LG phone battery for a great price, but it took way too long (week+) to travel from Van Nuys, CA to Palmdale, CA...a distance less than 50 miles."
High quality knock-off.  Why not pay less for more?
"Love this product but for two things.<br /><br />1. I ordered the yellow, and whenever I use flash photography on the rear camera, the image is a bit yellow due to interference from the case.  If the cutout on the back were a bit larger around the flashbulb it wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />2. The credit card slots are really snug.  The plastic ID slot is so snug I have to really struggle to get my ID in there.  I actually haven't put it completely in there because I don't want it stuck in there."
"I purchased this battery a few months back and I fell in love with it. It does what it says it does. It was a little bigger than I expected but I love the build quality of it. Its solid and not too heavy.  I usually just stick in my backpack and leave it there until I need it.  I have a Note 3 so having it is a big plus.  However, the original battery in purchased with break or malfunction, but the customer service department was great and a huge help in was able to provide a replacement really fast. I really recommend this battery and company."
very nice for the price
This product is described compatible for Samsung Galaxy S5 however it has micro USB and S5 has 3.0 connection. I tried plugging another cable to the hotcell plug and would not charge. Was unable to use.
"My niece is 5 and it seems she bends or breaks the smaller end that goes into the IPad Air. This cable seemed stronger then her and so far she's ok with it. I'm glad Anker sees the importance of quality, wether it be cables or chargers!!"
Great product lasts forever with the charge.  I was amazed to have used it a few times and did not need to charge it until the fifth time I charged my phone.  Very pleased with the product.
I love this case and now have it in 2 colors.  It is the perfect size for the Samsung Galaxy S5.  The case provides excellent protection and has held up extremely well after a full year of use.  I have dropped my phone numerous times and it has stood the test of time. I highly recommend this product!
This case is currently on my phone. It has been dropped many times and there is no cracks or scratches on my phone. I love how the blue part is rubber not plastic so it won't scratch my phone while putting it on unlike other cases. The pink part is hard which I love. I am very satisfied with this iphone case. 100%
Great protection for iPhone. Rhis style of otterbox cover my home bottom on my phone which does not allow dirt behind the screen. Recommend this box to anyone who works out in the elements.
"My Samsung Galaxy S3 has a terrible battery life regardless of all of the apps that I close after using.  I try to diligently make sure extra apps are not running and still I get short battery life - nothing near 24 hours.<br /><br />The Mogix was wonderful in allowing me to recharge my phone while on the go during the day, particularly when I was out nearly the entire day on my recent vacation.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with the battery charger."
"Excellent phone and delivered on time. Had it about a week now and the battery barely needs a charge. Great phone for my son who lost his last one. Verizon is trying to make you pay $20 a month for 2yrs for this phone or $220 cash, ridiculous... Thank you!!!"
Perfect!! Easy to use. Works great and will save $70-100 for an in store applied screen savers. Cool product. Everything you need to do a professional job.
"Best mount I've used for A/C vents. I mount the phone to the vent, then just pull the phone with mount and all right out of the vent when I want to use the phone, and push it back into the vent when I start driving.<br />Other mounts have a hook into the vents, but then you're using two hand to unclip the phone, versus one-handed use with this mount."
"Fit great, AM/FM stations clear, looks BETTER"
This is a very good one but i recieved a second hand one<br />When u talk is a little hard to understand the person in the phone but to listen music is cmvery nicee and adjusts very good in ur right ear!  I would b happier recieving a brand new one
"I recently switched to this case (purchased for about 13% more at a local retailer). I was coming from a much bulkier folio-style case on my iPhone 6 Plus. This thing is fantastic. It is very solid, even though it is also very thin. I have found that Apple Pay works better with this case than my old one because it can get the phone closer to the reader. I also am able to use a wider variety of mounts and holders because of the smaller size.<br /><br />I usually don't use cases on my devices, and the main reason that I choose a case for my iPhone is that the edges are so slippery. I can get a good grip with this case, but unlike a lot of silicone cases, it doesn't pick up dust and pocket-gunk.<br /><br />One thing that isn't mentioned very prominently anywhere here is that the front corners of the case are raised above the screen just a *tiny* bit. Not so much that you'd notice without looking directly at it. However, this has the benefit of raising the glass face of the device off the surface of a table if you like to set your device face-down.<br /><br />One minor complaint is that it is very difficult to get the phone back out, though not impossible.<br /><br />I've been using it for just a few days and regret not buying one sooner."
this is a decent cable however it does not provide much more then .8 amps. For fast and efficient charging you need a cable that can provide up to 2 amps for iPads and at least 1 amp for iPhones. It's hard to tell which ones can achieve this power requirement but there are plenty out there. This will work but it will take a lot longer to change you Ipad and about 20% longer to fully charge you mr iPhone. Other devices using usb will also suffer.
"The tempered glass cut out fit my phone perfectly. However, not happy with the bubbles created where the adhesive didn't spread. I read and followed the instructions correctly. Would'nt purschase again."
I very much like the stylus for my iPhone but it doesn't work at all on my iPad.  The main reason I made the purchase was for the iPhone so I'm not that displeased with them.  Giving them to friends that I hope they will use and enjoy.  Great value.
These don't &#34;latch&#34; into phone or USB so it is easy to dislodge and not charge your device.  I do like the shorter length.
This was so inexpensive and is much better than any expensive one we ever used.  I highly recommend this item.
Cheaply made. Basically trash. Ended up throwing it in garbage. Disgusting!
"The fit is perfect, and so far I have only used one. I would highly suggest this for anyoje looking."
this is the best portable charger fir iPad it charged 3 full charges and my phone about 5 full charges before it needed to be charged its self grate for long over seas travel
"For those of you who are into coloring pages, this looks like a coloring page for the back of your phone."
I love this screen protector.  I was afraid I'd drop my new phone and break the screen but now I don't have to worry about it.  The screen arrived in a few days.  It went on very easily and not a single bubble!  It seems like all the other screen protectors I've purchased for my various phones and tablets had at least one bubble somewhere  but not this one!  I love it!
"I love the case, however, it was supposed to be blue but what I received was a bright pink!"
"This phone is another Samsung slam dunk. However, it never got LTE for T-Mobile in the US. I don't know if all unlocked phones are going to have this problem. I really liked this phone and all of the features. If you're ok with not being able to get 4G than this will work for you.  Great phone and it's very unique. Would definitely buy again if I knew that I could get the speed that 4G LTE has."
"Won't charge my phone. Had to get a 2.4amp USB auto charger. Should have paid more attention when purchasing, I believe this is just a 1.2amp USB."
"Junk, the back door holding the cards breaks after 3 months of use.  I have one that broke and I purchased one for my wife that also broke.  Stay away until they make the door hinges stronger."
Aweosme HD quality car cam a must buy and it has a very good wide angle. I have tried many dash cams and this one seems to hold out with the insane desert heat here in Vegas.
Great and useful gadget.  I don't leave home without it and I never forget my iPhone at home anymore
"Good looking case, especially for the price.  The only thing I didn't like was the screen protector.  My Touch ID wasn't working with the profits teen protector.  I removed it and kept the shatter proof protector that I already had on my phone."
LG protective case works as advertised.
"Its a very cheap product. Don't waste your money buying it. When i plugged this in to my car charging port, it blowed the charging port fuse. I went to a mechanic and fixed the fuse. Again plugged in this one, it did same thing after.  I wont recommend this."
Yes the camera is good quality and work perfect. Now problem with installation fet perfectly as the factory on.l recommend it for everyone looking for galaxy s4 replacement.
I have used these on my phones for approximately 4 years and I recommend them for protecting your phone screens. They do not affect the touch control.
Great product.  Handsome looking pens and handy for tablets.
"I can complete my phone's battery at least twice, and still left to charge more. Excellent."
"Received my mini selfie stick today. It was very well packaged and also came with a little velvet bag to store it in. I have a large LG Stylo and its kind of a tight squeeze to get it in the clasp but it will hold it. The stick stretches about 2 ft. Just enough to get a few more friends into that selfie!! Or like me, getting a selfie with a concert going on behind you! Great shots thanks to this little guy! I did recieve this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. Overall its a great little selfie stick easy to carry in your pocket. Im definitely enjoying it!"
I used this cable for about six weeks and than it just stopped workin. I have tried it on different device multiple time since than but no result.  It was very difficult for me to believe that $15 iPhone cable will just stop charging so soon.  by the way I take a good care of my electronics and the cable had no visual damages so it may have been defective or just my luck.
"These days with phones being so expensive, more than laptops even, you need to protect it with high quality cases. This one hits it right on the nail head. The material feels amazing, no sharp edges anywhere and yet feels durable. The face cover is something new for me and so far it works like it's not on the phone face. A great added feature to know that your screen is protected by another screen. Headphone plug, charger plugs are protected really nice to prevent debris from going in. I love that feature. I'm also still able to charge my phone on the remote pad charger without having to plug it in.<br /><br />The section that goes on your belt is also solid. The clips doesn't separate from the receiving section, so it will be a bit bulky. I work on construction sites so this is the perfect case for my phone investment."
"great  case, cute an safe. good price"
Great product so far
It has nothing to envy of any mid-range phone . In my opinion many opt for this because of its excellent specifications and price.-
"Great smartphone, working in Venezuela 3G Digitel Movistar and Movilnet"
"Great case. Fits perfectly and doesn't mess up the buttons. It is also easy to get to all of the ports. The seller also included a stylus, water proof bag/case, a screen protector, and a screen cleaning pad. The case seems like it will protect the phone from normal drops and accidents."
So far so good!  One month in and it looks and feels good!
works great. Bought it to power my phone when used as a GPS. It provides more than enough power.
My husband puts these on phones for a living he places this one against my phone Gently  and it shatters.. Poor quality for as much as you pay for it. NOT WOTH IT.
I've only dropped it once so far and it did a great job of protecting the phone.<br />Part of the reason why I have not dropped it more often is because the case has fantastic grip!
"These screen protectors are really good for protecting my two Moto G phones that I've bought three weeks ago and are still doing a good job as I speak.When I first tried to apply them to my two phones they not that hard to get on the screens after I thoroughly read the instructions that they came with placing the screen protectors on were pretty straight forward.The pack of these amFilm Moto G screen protectors for the 1st Gen Moto G phone came with three screen protectors,three rubber bands,a dust remover stickers for cleaning off the dust on the adhesive side of the screen protectors and a card for getting the air bubbles out.Speaking of air bubbles that part of the installation to these amFilm screen protectors didn't stick all the way through to the point where I could not see any more bubbles on the screen to my Moto G phones.I mean I did use the card to remove the air bubbles as much as I can but I still noticed a little but it wasn't all bad even though the cut out line isn't entirely fitting the Moto Gs but that ok I thought I would just go along with getting these screen protectors any way since I was in need of good ones like the kind that has special features to them like HD or Anti-glare being added to the phone's screen which would enhance them for a better look and feel and that is why I bought these to give a extra HD look to my two Moto G phones and I really like them for that.Later if I happen to come across anything better than these screen protectors then I'll most likely get those after I do some research on them."
The case was bigger than the phone .. It did not fit at all. Money wasted .
Installed these in the front doors of my 2000 Subaru Forester to replace the ones that were distorting. Had to modify the plastic mount but once installed they sounded quite good. I wouldn't say they were fantastic but for the price they were a great replacement for the old factory ones.
"Great value for email, web, Facebook, Uber, etc.  First time with Android - easy.  Paired with H2O on arrival in U.S. from Asia.  Working in about 15 minutes following charge.  Prefer the slightly smaller screen / overall size."
I have a thin case on my phone and this is a hit and miss when trying to charge it.
"Flimsy, useless."
This product is incompatible with the stock 2007 VW Jetta.
my daughter likes it.  good product.  arrived within a week.
Haven't used yet. Looks like good quality.
"[[VIDEOID:14bcffebd6a45821a64d9f5b8a682de3]] This EMIE Memo External Battery 8000mAh with Wake on Shake is a pretty neat little battery. Its very slim  and comes in a few cool colors. Its packaged well too. It is an 8000mAh battery so it should charge your smart phone roughly a couple of times before needing juice back in it. Most phones have a 2000 to 2500 mAh battery.  It does have smart charging so it wont over charge your device. Your device tells it what it needs and this guy sends that to the device. You can plug it in and forget it..it will do its thing and do it safely.<br /><br />You do give it a shake to get the battery indicator to come on. Neat..but not necessary. It does have an LED light on it that lights up when its charging or being used. Here is my indifference..There 3 indicator lights on here to show you how much juice is left in this battery. The book says green is 0 to 30% ,blue is 30 to 70%, and red is 70 to 100%<br /><br />Here is my problem with that. Green is LOW? Red Is good? And 30 to 70% ....thats a huge jump to me ...30% means I need to charge this..70% means I'm still good. So what is it..good or no? So those 2 things really didnt impress me.<br /><br />Hey guys it does what it is advertised to do..it looks cool, its slim and it's got that shake to wake thing going on. The battery indicator thing really bugs me though. I am giving this EMIE Memo External Battery 8000mAh with Wake on Shake 4 stars for those reasons.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review."
"So far works great. In fact,  I ordered one, liked it so much, that I ordered three more. However when the three others came in they were similar products but had slightly different markings as well as connection. Not sure that it matters in the product performance, but unexpected."
"Works good, the ends are way too bright and the cord lights you can barely see. For the price, love it but had to put a small piece of black tape over the end smiley faces because it was so bright."
"The size of the phone is the main reason i made this purchase, and I def think it was the right decision. I love the functionality of this and its compact size. The camera is AMAZING, it is better than any other android phone i have own in the past."
"This is not an otterbox. This is otterbox lite at best. The belt clip is useless, you have to put it is screen down. Which means when you need to use the phone you have to take it out of the clip entirely, and it is a very tight fit. too tight. the case very much so does interfere with my screen protector. why did I get a stylus? Its a galaxy note. On the plus side the kickstand is kickass and it is considerably thin. would give 5 stars if the belt clip worked better."
The screen did not stick to the entire phone causing unremovable air bubbles in the top corners and because the top did not stick all the way it got caught on my pocket and bent the entire top down.
Quick Charge 2.0 Wall Charger really changes my phones and ipad very quickly.  I am not sure how I ever lived without it.  I use it non stop with work.  I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion which I am giving.  I love how simple this is to plug in and start charging your phone.  Because I often work on my phone day in and day out I have to keep it always charged.
I should have paid more attention to the 1 star reviewers because they were exactly right. The sound from the earphone has so much feedback that is immediately annoying and unbearable to utilize. Outgoing conversations are fair at best even with the extended boom microphone. The supplied earbuds don't seem to stay in my ear either no matter what size I use. The ear hook design has a tendency to pull the headset away from my ear canal thus defeating the noise cancelling feature. It is a no-brainer to return this asap. Trust me on this or you will regret your purchase.
I use this for my 2015 wrx and if fits perfectly.
Get phone case...Fits perfectly & protects the phone. Also arrived on time. Thank you
This was the first SPECK product that I bought.  Best phone cover ever.  Phone is protected from all sides.  I have dropped my phone a number of times in the garage and phone bounces.
"I ended up not using this, because Samsung replaced my phone for a issue I was having, and it obviously had a new clip on the phone. But I am going to keep for future use. Looks like it will fit with no problems, packaging has everything that it said it would."
"Cute case, especially for the price. I used it for about a month and then I noticed the air bubble get bigger. I was worried it would leak onto my phone so I took it off. I may use it again, but since it really doesn't provide any protection I'll use it for looks."
"A really nice portable power charger from foxx electronics. I love the size of it, it can fix nicely on my purse or my pocked. A little bit bigger than a regular lipstick sized. Not heavy at all. I have others and are very heavy. It is silver and nice looking.  I love that it brings a build in flashlight. That is a really nice extra. It charges my iPhone 6 plus good. Perfect for emergency I always carry it around specially when I go out shopping or to the park with the kids.  One thing that I didn't like it that it gets really hot. So either mine is defective or they are all like that. But it only happens some times. Either way it charges great. Very useful and easy to carry and use. Works with many electronics .  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion."
"I would give them 5 *, but one of the new batteries doesn't hold a charge like the other. I really think my problem is with my phone. I will find out  tomorrow after I get it back to factory reset, to make sure it's the phone not the battery. The wall charger is the best idea, so you don't have to wear out the mini micro USB charging plug. A1 + in my book no wear and tear on the phone for you to worry about if you ask a little one to plug it in or unplug it "
My son just got the S6 and he is required to have a durable case on it at all times. I use this case for my S5 so it was an east decision to buy. No complaints. Thought the S6 is about the same size w/o case as my S5 with cases on the newer Defender seems a bit smaller and lighter. We weighed the bare phones and they are nearly identical in both size and weight. I have to conclude the OB found a way to make the cases less intrusive in size/weight while offering the same protection and quality of materials. :)
Great price on these cables; seems we always need one.
I am looking forward to purchasing more ideas for amazon. I love my Galaxy s6 edge case
We love this bluetooth speaker! We use it everywhere and the sound quality is crisp and clean. We listen to an eclectic mix and all the genres we tried sound great (but I don't know about rap/hip hop as the bass doesn't seem adjustable)
"Amazing product, completely water resistant. Took it on a family vacation and got it wet and my phone was intact, dry. Got lots of people asking me where I got it from. Would recomend to everyone!"
For some reason  this samsung cable doesn't  work is the 3rd one i am order same problem
"Part of the apple watch experience is wearing it everywhere, all day.  Especially during active times, where often there is a greater chance of smacking it on something.  This product is custom fit to protect it very well.  the face is not the first thing to touch due to the raised edges, although you might want to add a screen protector as well.  The only reason it's docked a star is that I had hoped I'd be able to slip it on and off fairly easily to use it just at times I need that extra protection. However, it's functionality of fitting firmly around the body does mean some effort getting it seated properly around the buttons and parts. It was quite tight, and I found heating it in hot water helped make it more pliable to get into place.  So I won't be swapping it back and forth as much as planned.  I'm very happy to have it on hand for sports where a knock or scratch could be an option though."
clear pic quality but you can't see the screen if you turn it to the angle to see the road (unless you mount it on the left side of the window).  you have to remove the memory storage because it won't loop the video
Not for Galaxy S5! The closest fitting case (for S4?) is slightly too small which keeps the lens permanently out of focus.
"I drop my phone a lot and this keeps it looking like new, second case from Spigen, truly a quality brand and a good look for your phone. Excellent."
Loved the case only thing was that it's already falling apart on the bottom and I just received it today  it's like the glue didn't hold right 😔 but other than that it's so pretty and sparkly 😍
I ordered this one and the Anduro holster shell stand. This one is very secure and works good. The Anduro won hands down. No way could you lose this phone from you belt.
Very nicely made hard case cover.  Makes the phone look more attractive and sleek.
The product works extremely well. They were very inexpensive but took a long time to deliver. I would have paid more to deliver faster.
This is a great product. Easy to use and I love that it repels water.
The whole system works great on my motorcycle for gps and stuff. I am on my second one because the rubber cracked and dried out on my first one.
"The speaker sounded great and had awsome volume for such a small speaker, but it started making a high pitched whining noise after I tested it at full volume."
Very durable and easy to put on! The best part is no bubbles!! I also love that my fingers don't leave smudges on my screen anymore!! Very worth it! And hey you can't beat this low price! I highly recommend this!
No real difference for me between the desktop model and this one. Didn't broadcast the signal out of my room.
The colors are way different than view online. I didn't even know there's two colors on it. Wish it has free return.
The volume  is not that great on music and on the phone the other person on the other side cant hear me i have to hold the microphone close to my mouth
This is a very cute and practical phone case. It seems to be well made and fits perfectly. It was very easy to put on and the colors I just like the ones in the picture. I gave it four stars because the screen was very difficult to put on yet even though I'm not very carefully and there was no dice on the phone when I put it on it still had bubbles that I could not get out of it.  Overall though a very well-made product.<br /><br />I did receive this product for free or at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and that is what I have given you today.
"These are awesome headphones!  This is the first time I've ever used wireless/bluetooth headphones and I love them!  They are so convenient!!<br /><br />***FUNCTIONS***<br />- Pair with multiple devices<br />- Cancel, answer, reject, and end calls<br />- Redial the last number<br />- Call transfer (headset to phone) & Call transfer (phone to headset)<br />- Microphone mute & Cancel mute<br />- Volume +/-<br />- Skip to next or go back to previous songs<br />- Play/pause<br /><br />***PROS***<br />- My iPhone and Macbook found the headphones very easily and paired with them in seconds.<br />- They charged in about 10-15 min.  The instructions say that they take 1.5 hours to fully charge, but the first time I plugged them in to charge them right out of the box they were charged in about 10 minutes when I plugged them into my laptop which itself was not plugged into it's power source and these still were able to charge quickly.  Though the light turns blue when they are fully charged, whereas the instructions say the red light goes off - technically yes the red light goes off but there is a blue light that indicates when they are fully charged.<br />- There is a computerized female voice that says &#34;Power On&#34;, &#34;Power Off&#34;, &#34;Low Battery&#34; etc.  That's all I've heard her say so far, but I'm not sure what else is in her vocabulary.<br />- They will power off automatically if they aren't being used for about 10 min.  I was watching a movie computer with them and I paused my movie and walked away to do some things but kept the headphones in my ears and after about 10 minutes the voice said &#34;Power off&#34;.  But I just clicked the power button when I got back to my computer and it played no problem (I didn't have to pair them again).<br />- Great for working out because you never have to worry about the cord and if you're using your phone you can have it across the room, you don't have to carry it or keep it on you the whole time.<br /><br />***CONS***<br />- The volume buttons are conveniently on one of the ear pieces but the up and down ends of the volume buttons aren't as prominent to the touch (aren't as elevated for you to feel with your fingertip) as I would expect. Perhaps I'm just still getting used to them, but I occasionally have turned up the volume when I wanted to turn down because I can't feel the + and - very well, but remembering the + is at the top helps.<br />- Because these are wireless and have lots of features/capabilities like answering the phone and they have to pair with your devices etc. It is worth reading the instructions (which I normally wouldn't do with just a pair of headphones), but these have lots of capabilities so it is worth it to read the instructions so you can remember which buttons to press and how long to press them for to have the headphones do all the functions you want them to do.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these headphones, I am very pleased with them.<br /><br />_________________<br />Made by: TOSHENG<br />ASIN: B012QTR0AA<br />Product provided for review by: TOSHENG<br />Shipped by: Amazon LLCof the volume buttons aren't as prominent to the touch (aren't as elevated for you to feel with your fingertip) as I would expect.

pi got this item at a deep discount to try and review and give my honest opinion it was shipped fast and works for my needs
"I really like these. They fit flush into the lighter plug and allow me to keep the compartment/ashtray door closed all the time. When I want to use it, I pull the cable out of the glove box and plug it in. For me it easily charges two iPhones at the same time while driving on a trip. No more fighting over the plug and it disappears when not in use - win/win!"
Ugly color of dingy brown and offers little protection.  Would return it if it weren't such a hassle to do so.
"Have used this product for about two months now as my daily charger at work. Quality has been good, no experiences of not charging or being warned by iOS that the device is unsupported. Would (and probably will) buy this product again."
"This device is designed for the high-speed charging of a Galaxy S6.  I cannot speak to this claim.  However, it states that it is adaptive to work with other devices at their rated charging capacity.  This appears to be essentially true in all my tests.<br /><br />My primary phone is a Galaxy S5. The original charger essentially charges at the rate at just under 1 minute per percent of battery life when charging from approximately 50% charge. I have used other chargers that the phone identifies as &#34;slow&#34; and asks me to use the original charger.  This charger is NOT identified as slow and chargers the phone at just about 1% per minute from the same point of  discharge.  It is slightly slower than the original Samsung charger but pretty darn close.<br /><br />I also tried it on my Kindle Fire HD.  My Kindle Fire generally took overnight to charge with the &#34;normal&#34; chargers (generally less than 1 AMP).  So I purchased two &#34;high-speed&#34; chargers to deal with this and as backup chargers for my S5's charger..  The two other chargers are the Amazon 2.0 watt charger and an Orico usb fast charge with two usb ports - a high-speed and a &#34;universal&#34;.  Here are some quantitative test times using my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Amazon 2.0 Watt charger: about 13% in 30 minutes<br />Orico high-speed charger via the fast port: about 13%  in 30 minutes<br />Stalion charger: about 13 % in 30 minutes<br />Stalion charger with longer Kindle Fire HD cable: 13 % in 30 minutes<br /><br />I also tried this charger on my very old droid bionic.  The bionic charged from 15% to 30% of its battery in 30 minutes. That seems comparable to or better than I remember it charging when it was my primary phone. this speaks to the adaptability of this charger.<br /><br />Lastly, I tested it to charge several Apple devices.  Again, no extra speed but no charging issues.<br /><br />Overall, I find this to be a decent and capable charger.  The most significant shortfall is the very short usb charging cable -- Just 20&#34;!  Although this is annoying, If you have the original charging cables for your devices or other quality usb cables, there is no reason to not use them.  I did find that with my other high speed chargers (2.0 Amp), you can definitely have poor performance with some older usb cables.  If you are havingcharging issues, do not rule out the cable as the source of the problem.<br /><br />The last two points I want to make.<br />1) I did receive a free produce in return for this review.<br /><br />2) I have purchased other products from Stalion and I have easily and successfully utilized their warranty service.  This produce comes with a 2 year warranty and I think that is great since I know that they stand behind their products.<br /><br />I took one star off for the short cord. Otherwise, this appears to be a solid product with a great warranty.  At the list price, I think it is significantly overprices.  However, I have see in on Amazon in the $14 price range which is comparable to or cheaper than other  high speed chargers."
"Works great,  I like how it shuts off when your phone is full unlike other charges that make your phone beep over and over again telling you the battery is full and to disconnect the charger.  It also charges super fast on my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus"
I love it well worth  the money absolutely  water proof and it's not bulky it's stylish and looks great on the phone and the sensitivity on the keyboard is excellent  well worth It I have the blue one and loved it no problems.
"Prompt shipping, came sooner than expected.  This is my second one - the first one busted when my phone dropped, but my phone is unscathed.  Fits my iPhone perfectly."
not a scratch was made and sometimes it feels cool as in cold not &#34;cool&#34; which gives me a really good feeling about the phone. Due to my rugged usage it has got a few scratches and after 4 months I took it off (Worst decision ever). Would gladly buy it again. Actually I will buy again.
"This case is awesome! Holds the phone, 2-4 credit cards/id's and plenty of room for cash. I get compliments on it all the time. Loved it so much I bought one for my mom. Had an issue and customer service had it corrected in 24 hours. Really impressed!"
"The particular cable is just about the same price, had I bought those at TJ Maxx or Ross, and theirs are of more thicker cables than the ones I ordered from yourselves, just as thick as the original Apple cable that comes in the box."
Great case and very attractive.  Very hard to put on and remove.  Part of the plastic broke trying to take the case off to replace the screen protector
Works really good when plugged in to the car. When  running on battery signal is weak .
Arrived on time and works just great.  It is nice to have a similar holster option with out paying high wireless prices.  Fits just fine.
"With two 2A ports this charger will do two tablets at once or speed charge your smart phone. The unit has folding prongs so it travels without damaging your stuff or itself. The best part about it is when I plugged my old iPhone up suddenly the lights went dim in the house and BAM! just like that it converted it into an iPad! Wow! I was wanting a new iPad! SO feeling lucky I plugged in my MP3 player and BAM!, yes BAM!  it turned into a stereo with surround sound and the works!  This thing makes me wish I could plug my car into it.. bet It'd go Ferrari on me.. Hey this charger is the best and I'll likely get another.  I never seem to have enough ports where I want them and with two 2A outputs my wife and I can charge simultaneously. Make the choice for RAVPower and your gear will charge like never before.. heck it might even upgrade itself!"
In the description of the item it states that it has a protective cover so that it could be waterproof it does not come with a protective cover so that cannot make the item waterproof
"Wasn't satisfactory at all. It quickt o freeze, no front camera & at certain point it will nust go blend"
"The felt version fits my Cricket Wireless LG Risio very well and can be snapped.  If you are looking for something that is not a clunky cover for this model of LG, this will work.  The fit is snug, so I would go with the felt, not sure how the leather version would work.  To get the phone out, pinch the bottom and it slides out."
"This is my first phone with verizon prepaid.  I used to have an LG volt with Boost mobile which was awesome til Boost mobile completely screwed me over and overcharged my credit card, then suspended my account after disputing the charge.  Horrible customer service from Boost Mobile.  So here I am with Verizon prepaid.  First off, the phone selection sucks!  I didn't like any of the options, but had to pick..so I choose the LG Transpyre since the call sounded ok on my LG volt, and sound quality sucked on my Samsung Galaxy Rush.  Comparing the LG Transpyre to the LG volt, this phone is depressing.  But I decided I wanted to use something more as a phone and texting and use a computer to do all the other fancy stuff.  First off, the colors are so dull!!! I compared the colors to other phones, and with the LG Transpyre, the blues, reds, and whites are just so dull.  Instagram pictures don't even look exciting unless someone filtered the heck out of something.  That's a little depressing to not know how beautiful someone's picture really is.  For the most part it's ok, but once you see how the picture looks on another phone, you'll see that excitement is missing from the Transpyre  There's only 3 screens on each homepage compared to 6 on the LG volt.  So that's a total of 6 screens vs 12 screens.  So if you like to add a bunch of apps like I do, then there isn't as much room on the Transpyre compared to the Volt.  The speakers on this phone are on the back, which I hate, because once I lay it down, it's not as loud.  Call quality sounds staticy for me, I don't know what it is, but most of my calls to Hawaii are just full of static and is very irritating.  People sound muffled to me on this phone.  Loudness of calls is just ok, I wish it could be louder, and clearer more importantly.  Not sure what's going on, but my calls keep dropping when I make calls to Hawaii.  I don't know if maybe it's just me pressing the end button with my cheeks, but the screen usually turns offwhen I'm on a call, so I don't think it's that.  When I look at pictures, the bottom 4th of the screen has the gallery and won't shut off, it's very irritating that I can't see the full picture without zooming in.  Where's the calculator APP!!???!!?  That's the one thing I use the most and I don't see one installed.  I see an NFL app that I will never use though.  Opening the back case is kinda hard and frustrating, you open it by pulling up the part where the usb charger goes.  This screen is about the size of the LG volt, which is pretty big.  BUT, if you are on instagram, the buttoms take up 2 lines at the bottom which ends up making the viewing area actually small, which is frustrating since that means you have to scroll a lot more and can't see as much.  The LG volt only takes up 1 line on the screen and the other buttons are where the LG logo is on the bottom.  Bad design on this phone.  Overall, it's an ok smartphone.  The price is cheaper here than in the Verizon store.   If you buy it from walmart, they include a sim card with the phone."
"these are the best , wear these for jogging ,boxing and working out - if they ever stop working I will buy another pair that day. (Great product)"
Disappointed in this product. This cover makes it nearly impossible to press the buttons on the sides of my phone. It is easily scratched as well. It's nice to look at but not functional.
"It is cheap, and it makes the screen look a little cloudy, its not bad considering there are not a lot of screen protectors for the Nokia."
I bought this case for my co-worker who needed a different kind of clip for his LG Cosmose 2. I have purchased one like this before and it has served me well over the years. In fact I'm still using it. I highly recommend this case.
"does not work very well, dissconnect continiously, costumer service is great."
The phone case was ok. The kick stand broke after about 2 weeks. And the the case did start to chip.
"Sliding in and out of belt clip is difficult and gets stuck frequently, as if it is slightly too tight.  Clip pin started coming out within a month where I would have to manually put it back in, and belt clip broke and fell apart from one fall."
The tip of this iphone 6 plus case was to soft and did not hold up. This was ordered for my husband. I had to purchase another one.
"This is a perfect phone holder for your car. Works perfectly. It comes with two magnets to fit any size phone.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Ease of Use/easy to install<br />Small, powerful magnet on the vent clip.<br />Visually appealing while remaining small and mostly unoticeable.<br />Quick - Just pop it on the vent clip and you are done. Takes less than a second.<br />Mobility - Take it in and out of any car. Easy to travel with.<br />Works in any car (with a vent) and with any phone<br /><br />CONS:<br />None<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
"Looks nice, soft and rubbery, and inexpensive. Button feedback is very poor with this case, and it's actually tough finding the buttons. Ended up getting a Spigen hard plastic case after using this one."
Worked fine for 9-10 months before the regular port stopped working. Outside of warranty. Oh well.  ***UPDATE 9/13*** Anker customer service contacted me with 2-3 days of writing my Amazon review and we were able to come to agree on a resolution. I received a replacement product within 4-5 days and it works great so far.
I received a discount for my review of this item. These are the best headphones I have used. They are very comfortable and don't make my ears hurt after wearing them for an extended time. These headphones sound amazing and it was very easy to pair with my phone.
"This sounds ok but cuts out when you walk, the bluetooth isn't very strong. And this one has an annoying green light that flashes and can't be turned off.<br /><br />I bought a different one with prime that was much better. I only bought this one because it was $10 dollars. But it's not worth even that."
"A few months after purchase, we noticed that one port didn't work. I'm not sure if port failed or if it didn't work from the outset. Could probably return, but life is too short.<br /><br />Have owned for several additional months and remaining ports still work fine.  Aside from the fact that we have one fewer port than we'd intended to buy, we're perfectly happy.<br /><br />Based on other reviews, my experience isn't that unusual.  I'd suggest testing all the ports as soon as device arrives.  Alot easier to return/exchange at that point."
"Overall is fine. But it overheats a lot and I can't even record a video because I litterally my hand burning after 2mins of recording.<br /><br />Also the home stops working most of the time.<br /><br />I moved from Samsung to this one, because my one note started failing the frequency due to all the updates.... But must of the technology are doing the same. With product lifecycle less than a year."
Received my case today & love it!!!
"Delivery was perfect.  The quality is not very good.  Very cheaply made, don't expect it to last very long after running and it getting wet."
Phone will not update new BlackBerry software. Can't use. Very poor product. Useless to me. Will not update. Old software. Can not move my old phone information to this new phone.
This simple to use Selfie Stick works great. It is very easy to setup with your phone or tablet. I synced it with both just to see. My phone runs on IOS and my tablet is Android. Both synced within seconds and worked perfectly. It has a 35 inch extension. Which is pretty good for a selfie stick. It also slides into its self to make it easy to travel with. It comes with a charging cable so no need to go out and buy one. All in all this selfie stick has a lot to offer for the selfier on the go.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
"You must do a little research on these before successful use though.  The firmware is very similar to UV-5R and is essentially a repackaged UV-5 platform with dual PTT.  The issues with the UV-5 were not corrected in this variant, but it is cheap enough and is an effective rig in amateur service once you are familiar with most aspects and issues common to the Chinese radios.<br /><br />The primary (common to all 6x 82 series radios I have purchased) problem with this is the programming cable connector.  One cannot moidify the cable end to make it work on these radios.  You have to hold the radio connector tight to the radio with your thumb, regardless if the cable mod has been performed or not, to get it ti upload or download.<br /><br />The one anti-gripe I have with this radio is that it is advertised as a 7W HT, when in fact it is 8W on VHF and 7W on UHF.  I am not sure why this fact isn't advertised better."
"This was a gift for my husband.  I had initially planned on getting an AppleWatch for him, but I hated the rubber looking wrist band on the most affordable model.  I liked the looks of the Pebble and the fact that it would work with most phones.  My husband was thrilled with it!  It looks MUCH nicer than the AppleWatch.  The leather band suited my husband better.  He knows better than I how the apps are with it, but I do know he is pleased with all aspects of this watch.  I would definitely recommend the Pebble to anyone thinking about an AppleWatch and not wanting to spend so much on a rubber watch!"
Did not fit!
"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
"Bought four of these cords they look and feel indestructible and have real nice plugs now I'm down to one they last about a week and wasn't handled rough and act as if there shorted out, dissatisfied they usually have a fantastic product I hope this is a one time thing cuz I know how to go somewhere else"
Delivered fast and charges everything fast.
"I've had these for nearly a year now. They're pretty great for bluetooth headphones. Mine, unfortunately, didn't come with the extra plug, and the fabric in the actual &#34;ears&#34; of the headphone fell out within three months."
Use it on a Honda CRF 250 L and it worsk perfectly. Holds my Garmin Montana very tight.  Also holds my iPhone 6.
"It's a great case. Small, cheap, and simple. I recommend it to people who don't like bulky cases"
Just received mine.  Took about 3 minutes to set up.  It works perfectly with my Xperia Z3.  I'll use it more as a method to receive notifications vs. as an activity tracker.  So far it's been perfect.  No more missed calls or text!
"I was very interested to try the F-Color iPhone 6 case in Gold color. The gold color was wonderful as it matched the phone very well. The case is a 2 piece design, where one piece cover the entire edge and the other piece covers the back of the phone. Th two pieces fit together beautifully and it is difficult to see the joints between them. It is so good that it can seem like it is not a case but a part of the phone. Very nice fit and look. There is a hole for the apple logo and the phone looks very good with the case.  I have purchased F-Color cables in the past and they are built to last... so it was not a surprise that this case is tight and strong.<br /><br />Now this case does not have soft rubber cushions and it is not designed for very rough treatment. Other cases may go after the abusive handling and trying to withstand falls from high altitudes. But this is an elegant case that will protect the phone for normal wear and tear. I am very pleased with the look, fit and feel of this case.<br /><br />However, there is a major problem that I encountered. I use 3rd party charger cables and I use F-Color charger cables. I have not had an F-Color cable fail on me yet. I have had to replace many other 3rd party cables as they seem to die to quickly. So it was a surprise to me when I could NOT get the F-Color charging cable to fit into the phone with the F-Color phone case. The F-Color cable has a plastic end that is slightly larger than the original iPhone charging cable. The iPhone cable will fit and function with the F-Color case. The F-Color cable would NOT fit with their own F-Color case. The hole in the F-Color case is just a little bit too small. I was shocked.<br /><br />So I took the phone out and reinstalled the F-Color case as I must have done something wrong. It still would not fit. It seems that the F-Color case is a little longer than the phone and the charger plug can not insert far enough into the case to connect. The hole in the case also needs to bea little larger.  There seemed to be no adjustment or positioning that enabled the charging cable to insert properly.  I am so amazed that their own F-Color case will not work with their own branded cables. My previous case can use the F-Color cables and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />This is the only problem I see with the case. If you only use the original iPhone charging cable then the case works fine. However if you use cables with the larger plastic ends, like I do, then the phone case will not allow the phone to be charged. So this is a major problem and this not acceptable for me. I have returned to my prior case where everything works perfectly. Sorry, but I want my case to work with 3rd party charging cables. The hole in the case should be slightly larger allowing ALL cables to work properly."
Works.  Good price.  What can one say?
it was not what I expected the top wiring was the incorrect one. I'm look to send it back not a good product .
"With the previous case, my daughter dropped her phone and cracked the screen; now we don't have to worry about that."
"This screen is amazing!  Not only does it keep your screen safe but one of the best things I like about it is that it's oil resistant. I used to be a huge pain always needing to clean my phone's screen but since I've had this screen, it never gets dirty or oily! This is way better than the cheap plastic screen protectors or the ones that come with protective phone cases."
Seems to work fine.  It does charge phones and my tablet faster than the 1 and 2 amp chargers I have.
Just got this in the mail and it works great! I love the color too. A beautiful purple! The power is strong and charged my phone quickly. Love it!<br /><br />I got this product at a discounted rate in return for my HONEST and UNBIASED review.
"Great quality, just what I needed!"
A o K<br />LOOKS GOOD FEELS GOOD BUT NUT SURE IF PROTECTS THE PHONE
Love it!!!! And it came with a free stylus!!!! It was fast shipping.<br /><br />Pros: fits the iPhone 6+ perfectly.<br />Has a clip to slip it on your belt or pocket<br />And has belt loops so you can more securely attach it to your belt.<br /><br />Cons: nothing wrong wit case. But it is BIG ( but that's Apples fault) 😁<br /><br />I received this product for a fair review.
Easy to install. Not too bulky.  Fits in your pocket nicely.  Dropped it on a concrete floor with no damage to the phone.  Replacement of the screen protector is a real plus.
Great case.  It is like my others for Samsung phones but this one fits better for some reason on the small HTC Incredible (Verizon).
I loved this cover. It arrived on time and it was exactly how it was described. I bought this so it could be a heavy duty cover because I have two toddlers and because I can put like money or a credit card without worrying it will fall. If you want it for other reason than don't get this one. I love it.
"This case looks amazing and fits perfect, but is not very comfortable.  There is a premium look to this case.  It is fairly easy to put on and take off.  The back has a good grip to it.  The problem I had with the case is the aluminum sides are not very comfortable while holding."
Fits perfect with all the buttons aligned. The hard case incloses a basic silicone case and the colors are as shown.
Really nice mouse for the price. you can also adjust the pointer speed. fits nice in the palm smooth on a lot of surfaces
already scratched my screen but no visible damage to screen it self. Easy placement and no bubbles
"so let me explain my delimma. a waterproof, shockproof, dust proof phone case is often, unfortunately, sound proof also. not so good fo ra phone! but i work a lot in a wood shop and am building a tiny house on the weekend, so a bumper type case is just simply not enough. this is THE case. it has a hard inner layer surrounded by a soft layer kind of like an otter defender. but its not as bulky. and its more stylish. Am i the only one who doesnt want my phone to look like my M&M's? then the last piece,of  which three are sent with it , is the back-plate, and it  protects the back of the phone. so, unlike a defender it is EASY to get it in and out of the inner hard layer, and the back plate provides the protection for the back on the outside. its not just decorative. it would be apt to say this is a three part case. and it looks great. a little rugged, but stylish too. not to thick. great protection. there is a hole in the home button so your touch ID works. the ports are covered with soft plastic covers so things cant get in there. and call quality is fine, its the first thing we tested. highly recommend.  Update. I've dropped my phone numerous NUMEROUS times with this case on. I've actually broken the case in fact, but my phone is fine. And I'm a tall guy, I'm 6' 2&#34;. I've dropped it standing, tried to catch it, and knocked it across the room into concrete floors. And the phone is fine. Love it. ;)"
Love it! I used it for a few months until it broke..but honestly it lasted so much longer than I expected it to.
"Excellent watch, but not waterproof! My watch is now dead because I didn't know that the only way it is waterproof is for the plastic door to the charging port to be shut!  It is not rubber sealed, just plastic.  The ads touted that the watch was waterproof to one meter for 20 minutes.  I had taken several showers with the watch with no problems at all. I had taken service hours with the watch with no problems at all. But, I took it for a 20 minute swim and it got soaked. It never recovered. Other than that the watch was great.  I was under the impression it was waterproof.  Only on their website does it say that the charging door must be shot to be waterproof. I assumed that they had sealed the area around the charging port. But I was wrong. Later I bought a cheap Chinese replacement for $19 but the sophistication was way below that of the Sony.  The Sony has no microphone and no speaker you cannot use the watch as a phone. But it does alert you that phone calls are coming through you can read your texts and it alerts you when you recieve email. This works very well in an office environment where you do not want all your neighbors hearing your conversation from your wrist watch. The watch simply vibrates and alerts you that your phone is ringing. Quite sophisticated and just what I want.<br />Only wish I had known the conditions for being waterproof!"
"Damn good little phone. No internet connection which if fine with me. I can wait to get to a computer for that. My favorite feature on this phone is that it beeps when the battery is running low. Calls are clear, texts work great. This is the BEST basic phone I've ever owned and I've owned 4 or 5 since 2008."
Saved a lot of money! Almost purchased a new one at a store for $40.00! Free shipping! Can't beat that!
"[[VIDEOID:5698b5f7fbc30e7ecc9a7aee3ccda268]] We were not sure what to expect when received this product for review.  We have tested a few waterproof cases and pushes so we were ready to take this on a trip to Mexico for the beach and pool. The case did not disappoint . As we show in the video, you are able to actually submerge the case and whatever is inside without water damage.  We were able to fit a Galaxy 6 in a normal case (non Otterbox type) easily with some credit cards, ID and cash.  Using the strap for my arm was not needed, but tests with it were successful. Most people will either hand carry it or use the lanyard I imagine.  The lanyard worked fine and was long enough to wrap around my neck for the walk.<br /><br />One benefit I didn't see another review discuss, which we show in the video, is your ability to actually interact with the touchscreen on your phone while it is in the Wizen bag.  I demo how we were able to unlock, open the camera, move screens around and more.  This is a great added benefit of being able to not only protect it but use the camera.  The back of the bag has the built in slot where you should place the camera area so we knew there had to e a reason.<br /><br />The locks on the top of the box are sturdy but if you break one of those then the case pretty much becomes useless since it holds the seal. Make sure to take care of those when opening and closing the bag up.<br /><br />Overall we are happy and impressed with this and it goes on our travels that involve the pool and water now."
its a nice case but just like any of these types of cases ive had people cant really hear you on the phone. it is water proof which is nice and the case is made well but whats the point if no one can hear you talk.
"Simple, cheap, effective."
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.i love this case on my phone .. it snaps on easy and holster onto my hips with ease.. very sturdy and phone wont be able to fall or isnt loose..
If I don't have my phone close to the ear piece the music fades in and out... The fast forward and rewind button only work sometime. As far as the sound quality it's great.
"Purchased this to use with a Raspberry Pi. Makes a nice little portable system with minimal reconstruction. Just need a HDMI and USB adapter and you're all set, plug in the Pi and go."
"These were pretty good, but the max volume needed to be better so that my friends who I game with can hear me better."
Well finally after 3 try's this one works! I've gone without a charger for over a month and it was getting a little tiring because returning and re-buying takes so much time waiting to return and waiting for it to be delivered. But now I think everything will be fine. So far this cable does fit and it does work. Thanks to Amazon customer service rep (Norman?) I think his name was??
Nice price.  Works as described.
"This is a great product and works well on a variety of printers, which I needed. It also does great with a wireless mouse."
"Holds the phone great, but the rotation screw comes loose pretty often so the phone will twist sideways.<br /><br />Also somehow didn't think about the fact that this will permanently affect the little fabric that protects the cd player from dust and such."
I love this! The cord is nice and long and much thicker than the crap that Apple gives you. I highly recommend this.
This is not a really good case bz if u drop it...it break inside so i dont reccomend to get this case
The stylus is great.  My only problem was I didn't get a pink one I ordered.
"I received my case with high hopes for it. I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that the inner cover didn't even fit my iPhone 6, and the snaps didn't get snap on the bottom so there was a gap. Because there is a built in screen protector, this gap made it impossible to type without pressing ridiculously hard. I can hear the popping noise whenever I tap my phone screen as if the built in screen protector is being pushed back in. Not to mention, the screen protector came damaged with a smear that I can't get out no matter how vigorously I rub it with a electronic screen cleaning wipe. Very disappointed with the touch sensitivity/fit and will return this item."
"The sound is great on my iPhone 4s. But every time I make a whatsapp call, Viber or any other free calls I have to turn it OFF AND ON to hear through  the Bluetooth  when I get a regular call. And sometime the Bluetooth will  disconnect by it self"
"I measured my wrist at just under 6&#34; and the small was a little snug when I got it but loosened a little bit after a few weeks. The heart rate monitor built into some of the newer models would be nice, but at prices over $100 I can't afford them. The UP24 is great for my purposes (silent alarm, tracking sleep, counting steps) and at around $40 it's definitely well worth the price.  A tip, I didn't realize for the first 2 or so weeks that I used the UP24 that you can calibrate your band so it better calculates the distance you're walking. I have a fairly long stride for my height so on a 5km walk the app was only registering about 4km travelled. To calibrate your band: 1. Do a walk or run in stopwatch mode - short press once then long press the button on the band until the sun blinks.   It helps to have an alternative app running to map your distance (Map my run, Nike+) or to just calculate it later on Google Maps 2. Long press the button to end the workout 3. Tap the little white band icon in the top right corner of the app 4. Tap the black and white band icon in the top right corner of the open menu (next to YOUR NAME Up24) 5. Choose the calibrate option in the center and follow the on-screen instructions"
"The batteries are great.  I am a rather heavy user.  My battery might run dead about 4-5pm during a work day when I have a battery saver app running...the battery would run dead at 12pm if I didn't.  (in comparison, my friend, who has the same phone, has battery until night).<br /><br />It is hard to compare these batteries to the OE battery because of the added apps, etc through the years.<br /><br />I can say that the batteries are NOT cheap batteries.  They last just as long as my 1 year old OE battery.<br />The addition of the charger is great!  I always have fresh batteries ready.<br />Also the charger has a USB slot for charging an additional device...which is a great extra benefit when you are traveling."
This is a very nice screen protector.  It is smooth and glossy and very nice to the touch.  This protector included wing tabs for easy application.  The wing tabs were very helpful in applying the protector.  It kept your fingers off of the actually screen protector and it was very easy to line up.  Another nice feature of this product is that it went on very smoothly and pressing a credit card on it smoothed out just about every single bubble.  There were a few small ones left but that was a result of the one flaw.  This product came in a three pack and I used all of them before I got it right. The wing tabs are great for applying the product but once it is on it is difficult to pull the wing tabs off.  They are very sticky and on the first try pulled the protector back off of the phone so you have to re apply the top and bottom.  It also left a lot of glue residue behind on the product which was difficult to get off.  The second try did not leave as much residue but pulling off the tabs compromised the one corner and it did not fully adhere to the phone.  On the third try I put the protector on as before but this time I pulled the wing tabs off at the sticky part (had to &#34;pick at it&#34; with my fingernail) and that seemed to work best. No real residue left behind and the corner was not compromised.  There are some very small bubbles that I was not able to remove but it is not a problem for me.
"Not really for a note 4. You can jam it in there, but it is made for a smaller phone. Cheap quality. Got what I paid for."
"I received this product at a discount for my honest review.<br /><br />It's always a good idea to have an external charger handy when you're out and about and on the go. And believe me when I say, I am almost always out and about and on the go! I decided to give this portable charger a go.<br /><br />They describe the charger as:<br /><br />-ULTRA-HIGH CAPACITY 15000 mAh - No more hugging walls break free from the outlet! Tech Tribe's external charger offers enough power to charge an iPhone 6 (7 x`s), iPhone 6 plus (5 x`s), iPad Air (1.5`s)<br />-DUAL USB PORTS - 5v 1 amp & 5v 2.1 amp You can charge your smart phone and tablet at the same time or charge 2 smart phones. Very convenient when you are on the go. Never let your devices run out of juice again. You can even charge PSP, iPod, Kindle or any other device that is charged with a USB cable.<br />-AIRCRAFT GRADE ALUMINUM - If lightweight and portable weren't enough this top of the line charger is also ultra-durable. The case is made out of heavy duty aircraft grade aluminum for added strength and durability. Also it will not overheat like many chargers with plastic cases.<br />-LIFETIME WARRANTY - Make this the last charger you ever buy. If for any reason your Tech Tribe Razor is found faulty you qualify for a replacement under our warranty. We only require you to register the product within your first 30 days of purchase and you are covered for life.<br />-WHY SHOULD YOU BUY OUR CHARGER - Lets face it when you search amazon for a high capacity charger you will find many big brand names with great offerings. However, when we compared the competition we realized the quality for most of the chargers was very low, including the use of plastic cases in order to save on production cost. The plastic typically gets hot while you are charging your device. Also the internal components on most power banks were put together very crudely. We saw the opportunity and would like to introduce Tech Tribe Smart Boost, a high quality charger with aluminium casing and sleek design. Overall a great value!<br /><br />I have both Apple and Android products so having a device that charges both is necessary. The Tech Tribe handles all devices flawlessly and recharged them in good time. It did not overheat, which I find many devices do.<br /><br />The only downfalls to this charger are you have to carry the charging cords of your devices with you, the Apple ones especially. And they say it is lightweight but I found it to be a little on the heavy side.<br /><br />The long and short of it is it works just like they say it will. Don't go without power ever again! Pick up this external charger and your worries will end."
It looked solid when I assembled it but head mount started to drop. You have to constantly tight it .
My ipad is like new again this replacement part worked out really well. Saved me a lot of money on costly repairs.
I tried 2 other S5 flip cases with a spot to put my driver's license and they both broke in a few days.  My BUDDIBOX is now 2 years old and going strong.  I have dropped my phone several times and it never gets damaged. The BUDDIBOX is the BEST protection ever for my Samsung S5.  I purchased 2 more BUDDIBOXs for family members phones and they love them!
Seems poorly made. Slips out of the holster too easily. Case/holster is too slick... it slides around way too much. Not rubberized at all. This unit also doesn't stand in the landscape orientation too well without falling over all the time.
"This case is exactly as shown in photos. Made well,  fit is perfect and incredibly well priced. I put a tempered glass screen protector on my Note 5 and with this case there is no need whatsoever to buy an otter box at 5 times the cost."
"If your like me you have probably searched for hours, and bought many phone cases that after a couple uses you just don't like! Well I have personally found the phone case that is perfect for me! The Phonefoam Secret Case is perfect for my and my busy lifestyle. It provides rugged, durable protection for my phone, yet it is multifunction and looks sleek and stylish! The Phonefoam case isn't big and bulky, you will have no problem fitting the phone in your pocket still, but it has foam cushion to support your phone and prevent breaks from dropping. It has an amazing feel to the case, it soft and comfortable to use my phone now. It also has a convenient slot for your drivers license, or credit or debit card that is hidden! So if you loose or misplace your phone, your important card will be hidden, and I doubt the person will have time to find it before you report it missing. That to me is a huge plus! It also has a nice compartment with a mirror and can hold any other cards you need to take on the go with you. The Phonefoam case is so stylish and cute, I love packing my phone inside, it is easy to put on your phone, and easy to take off. It fits perfectly over your phone and doesn't mess with the function of any of the side buttons. I can also plug my phone into my charging dock without removing the case, and the cable fits in perfectly as well. I feel so safe now<br />Packing my phone and important card, because I know my phone is protected and my card is hidden as well. I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The price however does not affect my opinion of the product."
this was a terrible case. does not fit the iphone 6 and it broke when i tried to put it on.
The case is great only reason I gave 3 starts is because my case is not smoothed to perfection . A lot of the cut outs are not completely smoothed along the back
"disappointing!!!!<br /><br />i can fold a dollar bill to make it fit, but there's no way it can be called a Money Clip,<br /><br />it does hold two cardsneatly"
"It works, it is cheap, and it is a great value considering the price."
"It's unfortunate that this phone is not Sprint compatible and I'm unable to activate it with my current carrier. That being said, it is a nice phone. Decent size. Has a great camera (the camera is fabulous! better than the one on our iPhone 6) and is an affordable low price. Just do the research before buying to make sure you can use it with your carrier."
This product deserves the five star rating.
It is not a fast charger at all! I can get about 10% an hour. While my other charger can go from 0% to 100% in just over an hour.
It does not protect your privacy as well as the tech armor. For the price I thought it would be better but nope. You can see everything from the sides.
"Really cute case, however, it didn't take long for the closing tab to begin cracking. i have replaced it with a leather case."
"Great case,fits well."
The case  doesn't last  long
"Bottom front lip is thin/flimsy leaving the from exposed, this also curves into Spen area.<br /><br />Normally these cases are on point, they refunded me the purchase price at least.<br /><br />Will order again once they fix the manufacturing defects."
2 of the 3 charging heads broke off within a week under normal use. The level of quality is reflected in the price. Be very gentle if you choose to purchase.
Very good phone . The best prices and especificaciones.-
I love how fast this thing charges but I kind of wish the cord had a little less resistance so it did not pull on the part that connects to the phone so hard when stretched out
Already broken in same place as the other 2 i have had awful product
Increased the signal on my cellular game camera by 2 bars!<br /><br />I'm using it on a SpyPoint 4g game camera. Increased the signal by 2 bars and works great.
Perfect fit.  Loved the variety of colors to chose from !
"Great little charger. Finally got a chance to test this little guy yesterday when we had a power age due to wind storm in the Pacific NorthWest - which means mostly cloudy weather. Even though there were only sun breaks ( a common weather term int he PNW) this little charger was able to keep two Ipads and two Iphones charged all day (does two devices at once).  So I cannot speak to longevity - as I just bough tit - but so far so good - great actually. Very portable, I will take it on my next hiking trip or any other trip for that matter."
"A must have for Iphone 6 + as the bare chassis is slick and will slide out of your hand. This full carbon fiber case is incredibly light, adding limited bulk to the already big phone. The case has a great tactile coating making it tacky and easy to grip. The chrome apple logo is hidden by the case which is my preference as the logo is the tackiest and least aesthetic appealing thing about Iphone 6s."
"This item was bought for a family member  who has a gt-i8190<br /><br />The battery that was supplied by samsung was utter trash no matter what settings i put on her phone the battery would still drain quickly, and it would almost always deplete it 100% after a simple 30 minute conversation. The regular battery samsung included would not even last through an entire day causing the phone to be unusable to a certain point.<br /><br />This battery made things much more easier it made the leather case that was being used before useless because this battery has to be used with the backplate it comes with otherwise the battery will fall out. Before  using the standard 1200 mag battery from samsung the phone was being charged twice a day sometimes 3 times a day.<br /><br />With this battery the phone went from being charged 2-3 times a day to once every 3 days. And this is all with playing some games, texting, and a few calls actually on the 3rd the the battery is still good but its at about 20%. Since the battery is bigger and has more MAH it requires this to be charged double so normally i leave it charging overnight on the 3rd day.<br /><br />I have only used this for 3 weeks, i was a little concerned first because of how some chinese off brand batteries are however this was improve the usage of the phone it was for by far.  If i have severe decline in the battery i will update my review but i hope the battery at least last a good year.<br /><br />It doesn't appear some manufacturers make leather cases to accomdate a larger back cover like this however i found a solution for my family member to use her old leather case. Since the other case has a back cover glued onto the case i simply ripped it off and i crazy glued this battery cover to the leather case and now she can use her old leather case with this extended battery."
"I have been use it for a year already ,comfortable for watch movie!"
"What an awesome, affordable product. Comfortable and do not fall out during physical activity. Just put these to the test during my run and they're so ideal that it would be ridiculous to throw your money towards something more expensive and unnecessary.<br /><br />For the price, these have a great sound, great battery life, and are extremely comfortable and don't fall out!<br /><br />Buy these now!"
"I have not used this product yet, but my daughter had one exactly like it when we went to Italy.  It works great for curling irons, camera batteries and cell phones.  It was always charging something!"
works.  durable.  no complaints.
"The vent option ended up being a good option as I thought it would block the AC, but it doesnt.  It just doesnt hold so well when trying to place the phone on it.  Once in place.....very secure!"
So I bought this thing about a month ago or so but the belt clip didn't last two weeks of me getting in and out of my work trucks. Broke and now I still have to have it in my pocket. And it seems to be for left handers because when I pull it out of the main cover and it power button seems to be on the wrong side
"This product does protect it from water. The only thing once under water I could not use the screen for anything, so I would have to start a video above the water then take my phone underwater to do a video and this was OK but I really wanted to take pictures under water."
"I've had two break, and the company's response when I contacted them about it was to give me a link to buy more.  I did, but I'm not buying Jarv products again."
"After I received this watch on time, I configured it with my Sony xperia z2. Everything went on smoothly.<br />Since April this year to date, I don't have any complaints. Again, I recommend it to everyone."
Charges my iPhone 6 Plus at least 3 times. A con is that it takes many hours for the actual power bank to charge.
"Purchased this phone from the Apple Store and it was a pleasant experience. The larger screen size is very nice and comfortable to use. The design of the phone is thin, light, modern and beautiful. It is at times slower than iphone 5 and even iphone 4. There are many dropped calls, and not good reception while talking most of the time. These are the same issues from previous models that unfortunately have not been fixed yet. Overall the larger screen size and modern design make this phone a good decision."
"These are by no means a high quality speaker, but they do serve the purpose and as usual you get what you pay for."
Case doesn't snap well. Pops off easily and have to restart phone.
You just can't beat Otter. The quality is amazing and if you want to protect your stuff for years then otter is the answer.
"First and foremost I received this case at a discount to give an unbiased review on. Upon first look the case is sleek and feels of a fairly good quality. It fits the phone very well and is very comfortable while being worn on the hip. Due to the size of the case it could be caught on something while being worn from the hip so be careful of that, not to say the case is overly large but it does house a large phone. The case feels firmly secured when closed unlike other cases I've used in the past. All in all it is a terrific case especially for the money. I am very pleased with it."
Rocking phone!
Works great.  This product reduced the number of outlets my daughter needed to use in her college dorm.
"Very prompt delivery, and item as described, but cannot charge it with some of the non-apple chargers. The opening at the bottom is not wide enough to insert the cable fully in. Very nice design."
I've had a lot of problems with this phone and am not happy with it.  It won't save addresses correctly and I've sent products to wrong locations many times.
This is the most easiest screen protector ever to apply. No bubbles at all! Just place it in your clean phone and that's it! The clarity is so clear that you cant even tell its on. It hasn't scratched at all and is very durable. Great product and great price!
The Aux cable works but there is issues with ground noise from the engine that is audible. Not really a fault of the product and is a fairly easy fix with an isolator. The lightning connector does not play music for some reason. I can't figure out how to get it to play audio through it. I've tried two different iphones and they aren't showing up or sending audio. It will charge the phone though. Personally it's not an issue for me as I don't have an iphone but still would have been nice to have that feature for friends or family that want to use it.
"Slim, lightweight and very easy to grip. Perfect for lightweight and light duty protection."
"The charger works good with a 2 amp power adapter, but the suction cup design is useless in a car.<br />The phone slides off with any movement at all. You can't drive with a phone in place. (Galaxy S6)<br />I made a small aluminum tab and glued it on the bottom edge to hold the phone in place, but any bumps still cause it to fall off."
"I love the case, HOWEVER, I purchased the teal case & when I take pictures with the flash my picture turn out greenish."
"I don't understand the negative reviews on this product. I bought this item and took it to a professional to install it for me. After installation, I left the store a happy camper. The GPS worked without any issues, the back up camera worked without any issues., the system worked without issues Everything worked as expected. This is the best stereo you can buy for the buck. I think that the issue is that people try to install it by themselves and end up not installing it right. Mine works excellently with no complaints at all. If you want your system to work well, take it to a professional that knows what he/she is doing. This is the best equipment I have ever bought and was 100% happy. When my radio or GPS is on and I put my car in reverse, the back up camera comes on and when I put my car in drive, the backup  camera goes off while my radio or my CD or my GPS is still on. I don't have to do anything to make it work. In summary, if you want your unit to work well, take it to a professional and I promise you will be glad you did."
love the case. The colors are very cute just not as neon as in the pics but still very close. I got them today so if theres any bad reviews in the future I will just let everyone know! :)
"Worked for a month before it fell apart.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I had originally voted this product one star, but shortly after I was contacted by anker and they offered me either a different unit or a refund. I chose the refund and the process couldn't be better. They emailed me at every step of the way and completely managed my expectations. I got a notification when- my request was received, when it was sent to amazon, when it was approved by amazon and I got notifications from amazon along the way as well. Got my refund within days. I would deal with this company again.<br />Side note- I have a portable battery from them and it works like a charm."
excellent little battery for the s5. couldn't get any smaller and still provide the extra battery capacity that it offers. I ordered the black one and found that the matte black finish looks good and offers average grip. I would say that it has effectively doubled my battery life and love the fact you don't have to turn the unit on for it to work.
Hard to aim the screen protector with the tablets speaker/camera they don't seem to aline correctly.  But in all its not a bad screen protector works pretty good
"Overall it was a good purchase. only when i recieved it, the package was open, there was a tiny scrach on the screen under the screen protector, and surprisingly it was the middle east model!!! The package arrived with arabic writings on it. except for this, the mobile is running perfectly. fast processor, crisp screen, amazing camera. I love it."
"I always purchase Finite for all my devices, tablets and phones. Well made and lightweight."
"Got two, love the sound they can produce. On my 2000 V6 EX Accord, this pumped brand new life into the speakers that I never thought was possible. One of my units is much dimmer than the other, however. Wish there was a brightness setting to adjust on these. It's mostly visible, but I'd appreciate having the option to adjust."
"Mini size super battery. It is as small as a mini flashlight or close in size to a lipstick case but carries an 8 hour charge. And, it comes with the cables, you don't have purchase them seperately, what? I know! Plugged it in to my iphone 6 which was at 10% and in less than 30 seconds my phone was at 95%. Incredible price, super easy to use and does the job well."
I gave an extra star because the color is vibrant & looks amazing! But one drop on the (hardwood) floor & my screen cracked :-( what's the point of a case if it doesn't protect the screen? Disappointed.
"Great for the Iphone 6. We are hard on phone really heard on them but these covers have done a great job well over a year and the phones are still like new,"
So I have had the phone for nearly a month now and I will try and make this short.<br /><br />- Battery lasts a long time and charges fast.<br />- Screen is clear and bright.<br />- Touch screen could use some improvement. It works but sometimes you have to press harder than normal to navigate due to sensitivity.<br />- The OS is a older format and isn't as refined or user friendly as newer versions.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good phone. Can't beat it for the price. Yes there are a few things I wish were better but you get a lot of bang for your buck with this phone. Its perfect for someone on a budget or need a everyday &#34;beater&#34; that just works day in and day out. If your wanting something fancy or into having the newest gadget then your better off paying five times as much for what will make you happy.
"This is a great screen protector that is easy to transfer from packaging to phone screen. This protects my phone screen as if it is a 10 on the Moh's scale, but retains its sensitivity."
"its ok, the cutouts on the side seem to hinder being able to use the buttons easily."
Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
"I really don't like the  types of mounts that attach to places like air vents, cigarette lighters, cd player slots, or use suction cups. I do like the custom mounts that attach behind a trim panel and are pre-bent to fit - but they are pretty expensive. If you're willing to tinker a bit to find the best place, this is a great solution and you can't beat the price. I used this with a Bracketron device holder which attaches to this mount easily using the Bracketron t-notch plate. I was able to use this without needing to screw it in anywhere on the vehicle - once I re-attached the dashboard trim panel it was snugged up tight. The three bendable prongs at the mounting end are great to get a custom fit. Very impressed with the quality and design for under $7!"
"Good idea but with an Otterbox case on the iPhone, I find it spend way too much time lining up the connector. Wanted a dock I could quickly drop the phone into but this is more work than simply using a regular lightning cable. Would not recommend."
"I like that it has 2 USB ports - very handy since it seems there can never be enough ports.<br /><br />It was difficult to test the air filter part.  I do not smoke and was not about to to test the product.  Great that it does filter though.  As a hayfever sufferer, I always am looking for &#34;natural&#34; solutions and an air filter like this would be one.  Sometimes filters can be loud but this one is not at all - perhaps masked by the ambient noise of the car.<br /><br />I purchased this at a reduced price in return for an unbiased review."
The anchor fell off on day two of having it and the plastic part that holds your actual phone snapped when I put the phone in the case for the first time! Waste!
I have always been a big fan of Kenwood products. I purchased this amp to replace the same style because of issues with the circuit board. When the amp arrived it wasn't the one I ordered it was the 2000watt version. I'm not complaining just wish they would have told me so I could have done some research on it. I haven't noticed the 200 watt difference. With the hot days we have had I have been putting it to the test seeing if it will cut out as it's not fan cooled. It's been doing great I recommend this amp so far I will update if I have any issues.
I purchased this mostly for camping but it's the best purchase I have made. I use it constantly. My new car doesn't charge if the engine is off. My cell a lot does something that uses energy and maybe fading fast. This weighs no more than a cell and charges on the fly. I used constantly  to keep my kindle charged while away from a power source. Yesterday I carried on a long hike because the phone had dropped to 52% for some reason. Love this thing!
Great protection for my iPhone. Not too bulky either.
Worked b- for a bit..now the static is too bad to unDer stand anyone
"I really was in need of a longer charger and this one seemed perfect. I absolutely love the length, for this price it seems like its worth it. But don't be fooled, the first couple days it was awesome and worked excellent. I started to notice that the lightning symbol in the top right hand corner was on meaning it was charging but the percentage was going down while i was using my phone. I figured i maybe needed to put it down for a little and use one of my older chargers, however it would work on and off. Sometimes it charged while i was on my phone and sometimes it didn't, it was working fine when my phone was off. Then it got bad, my phone was on a low percentage the night before maybe like 20%. I plugged my phone in thinking it was charging. The next morning, I woke up late because my alarm hadn't gone off and my phone was dead. My phone had not been dead the night before so this seems strange to me. That day i tested the charger out on someone elses phone thinking its maybe a problem with my phone but the phone i tested it on had a percentage of 71 and i played on the phone for a few minutes and checked and saw the percentage was at 69. I turned off the phone and left it alone and it was now at 68%. Im so confused as to why the percentage is going down, i can see why it would go down while I'm playing on it because perhaps its just not charging. It was so strange to me that when i turned it off the percentage still went down. Maybe its just the charger i got or maybe its the brand... i don't really know what to do because my older charger is being funny as well. Did this charger ruin my phone battery?"
Excellent product. Very satisfied with the retractable cords. it's elegant and almost invisible. Sound is clear and microphone works great.
It never worked the red light came on but it never  charged the battery a piece of crap . Only gave a star because I had to.
This case would be great if it had not broken within a couple of weeks. The case and holster both are broken. I am not rough on phones at all and this said it was the armor series case. The plastic is very thin and cheap. I would not recommend this case to anyone.
I just love this iPhone case if I'm out and need to  fix my hair I con just look on the back and I'm done I Recommend you get this case thank you Amazon
Works well overall. I have used this item on a couble of rides for about a week. The only reservation I have is the red Web type rubber piece that holds the phone. Seems if it were to stretch or break the mount would no longer be<br />usable.<br /><br />This concern might not be warranted. Only time will tell.
"This item wasn't a reliable product. After two weeks of having it, under 2-3 uses, the outlet usb adapter died on me. It was left charging a galaxy tab and found died in the morning, while not even charging the device. Worst investment ever. I won't buy from Aukey again. smh."
"piece of junk, doesn't want to hang right, the stickers they give you to put it up , don't stay and the brackets that the magnets are in are all chipped and broken , I sent mine back"
I've had this product for about three months.  The battery drains almost completely after a short phone call of 5 minutes.  It takes about 8 hours to charge it about 20 percent.  There are glitches and things don't seem to work right. Such as touching the screen and it is frozen or takes me to different applications.  I'll be in the middle of something and the screen goes black and it will restart.  Several more issues as well.  I'm not happy with this product.  It's not really reliable and I feel that it's a lemon.  Once it's bought and paid for nothing you can do. There's a 30 day window of return but if there's no chance to use the phone during that time your out of luck.
Didn't work.  Not Apple
"Great, like it"
Perfect item. Buy it.
"Bought it as a replacement for my sanho purchased in 2009. However the slow transfer speeds but me off, I am not able to partition the drive which I could do earlier.."
"I don't think it lives up to its hype. About one third of the calls are not clear enough to hear. I have to shut the ear piece off, or call back the person that called me."
"Fantastic case, the hot pink is a beautiful color. Great customer service and received quickly ! Would definitely recommend to friends."
"the screen touch works okay through the cover, but people have a hard time hearing you talk.  You end up taking your phone out everytime which is a hassle.  It does hold securely to your arm."
FYI: I wear a size 10 and these are a bit loose.  Should be perfect when I add a gel insole.
"As expected, this selfie stick is pretty neat. I love it! Handy and sturdy. I love the colors. Will definitely recommend to my friends."
Great Product.  It's always protected phone well.  Only complaint would be with belt clip - it breaks easily.
If I could get rid of the busy signal it would be OK. It has nothing to do with charging the unit. I have it plugged in to the wall. It's compleatly  unusable.
"Good price ,works good!"
"The phone is water proof, until parts of it start falling off and breaking. I have had this case less than 30 days and the flip out that covers my stylus broke the 2nd day that I had it. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
So far so good. I have not checked the water proof quality but it will do for every day use.
"Works well. I actually purchased a second charging station because I wanted to be able to charge in multiple places. It's very cool, especially the secondary battery attachment that comes with it."
"It works great, except for the phone mic system. Probably better to buy the model without the hands free calling."
"Battery runs down pretty quickly when connected to wifi, charge twice daily. Takes great pics and has great features otherwise."
Good product.  I have had many bluetooth before and this is one the best value.
Antenna works alright better than the smaller one! Still could have a wider range of service. But it does save a life if needed.
This was alright but the tools included to open the iPod up broke and I needed to use a tiny screw driver. The batter fit perfectly and I haven't had an issue with it to date.
We have 2 polaroid 9&quot; tablets. We have bought a lot of silicones and they didn't fit...but these fit like a glove and everything lines up perfectly!
"I am a serious opponent of texting or even chatting on the phone while driving, just TOO DANGEROUS! But I do use my phone for Google Maps, and being an older version human, I don't entirely trust that ethereal voice coming from the phone. I want to actually see where I am going next, and that involves looking away from the road and down at the phone. I bought this nifty gadget to rectifiy that issue and I love it. Again, being that older version human, I need to have the dang thing a bit closer than the windshield in order to read it. The A/C vent option is the perfect position. This product clips on to the horizontal vent slats and has a collapsing stabilizing leg that allows it to fit onto a multitude of surfaces. The phone grasps are very easy to operate and have both side and bottom lips which are sturdy and secure the device well. The platform is adjustable and once you find the angle right for you, it is secured tightly in place with a simple twisting lock mechanism. I also like that the bottom lip has ample space to allow the charger to be in place. I like that insertion and removal of the device are extremely easy, which allows you to remove it and store it out of sight when not in use. I did read one question regarding the possibility of obstruction of airflow from the A/C, and I do not agree that it has no effect. I live in Florida and it is now August and this is of keen interest to me. However, while I did find it obstructed the airflow quite a bit, I resolved that by moving it to the farthest position of the two vents. That took care of it, at least for the driver side, and once the car cools off, I doubt it would matter much anyway. All in all, I think it was one of the best purchases I made recently on Amazon."
"wanted a design without a closure, however the leather started wearing after 3 months.  In my opinion, overpriced for overall quality."
well i got this for my 2006 Nissan Altima i installed a boss radio and well it didn't fit i had to cut the top off and even the sides are to big it would hit the lip of the radio so i have to mess with it some more.....so its not installed yet
"Bought these for two way communication between fleet vehicles.<br /><br />The Radio:<br />Pros: Attractive and low profile design, sturdy housing, good ventilation, loud speaker, loaded with features, transmits on every frequency it receives (not limited to amateur band out of the box), good mic picks up audio at any angle and voice does not drop out if you get too far from your mouth (good for inexperienced operators).<br /><br />Cons: Only red, pink, and blue display colors available (no green), When attached to an MFJ power meter this radio only put out around 12 watts on high, 8 on med, and about 4 on low(Still makes great contacts and covers nearly 10 miles vehicle to vehicle on a full length 1/4 wave antenna) The programming software that comes with this radio installed and seemed to operate well on my windows 7 64 bit OS laptop but once I went to send my channels to the radio it said that the port was not opened. This was probably me doing something wrong but without any information included with the software and with very little outside information I was not able to resolve the problem. I ended up programing the radios through the menu which worked well but was a little tedious.<br /><br />Also worth noting:Decent/standard bracket, Power cord plug and fuses are standard/identical to a Kenwood, The instruction manual is obviously translated but the majority of the information is explained well. There are some places where you may need to &#34;fill in the blank&#34; so to speak.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this radio to anyone who is needing affordable communication. A very good and sturdy unit especially for the price!"
Got these for my daughter to use at school in the computer lab. The sound quality is perfectly balanced. They store easily in a small plastic bag. They are easily wiped down with an electronic wipe.
"It's not bad, I thought I was buying  A more secure silicone case. That was my fault. It is very stylish"
The ear piece receives ok but the other person cannot hear too well due to low volume. I would have to be almost yelling for people to hear me. I would not recommend this for any professionals.
Great product with great customer service
This is a good product. My only concern is that I won't be ale to use it when I need to turn on the heater in my car because I'm afraid that the hot air coming out of the vent will damage my phone.
Perfect! The lock feature comes in handy for different lengths as compared to others. iPhone camera with remote comes in handy. Bluetooth easily found and working in seconds. Other attachments for Hero / Camera also a plus. Fits iPhone 3's/4's/5's & 6's -Also 6Plus (Expandable iPhone insert)
"The price was right, and the screen protectors installed with no more than the usual fuss and bother.  The Zune HD was in used condition so it wasn't quite perfect, but having the protector helps keep it from getting further scratches and hazing."
perfect condition<br />Thank You!
This is ReStore SL4000 4000mAh Power Bank with Backup Solar Panel. I try to charge my LG phone with solar battery as much as possible.  I love solar battery chargers. I keep the charger on patio on weekends and let it charge fully. This charger is simple. One input for charging itself and one for charging devices. Simple and size of a smartphone. Works great in emergencies. If you are dedicated you could charge phones daily through this as well. A sample was sent for review purposes.
I was able to put this screen protector on myself. In the past I had the phone company put it on the new phone. This one was so easy and no bubbles. Just clean the phone with the solution and cloth in the package and line it up on the phone.
"The charger came on time, but I had ordered the wrong one. I needed the mini and went to the Verizon store to make sure I got the right one this time."
"I bought this for a Nexus 6. I love the black bezels on this tempered glass screen protector, it makes the phone look as if there isn't a screen protector on. Installation was easy, but you have to be careful not to cover the front camera lens."
"This is a little more expensive than other tempered glass screens, but I think it's worth the extra couple dollars. I dropped this from around head height screen side onto a giant ass rock. There was a tiny tiny crack at the impact site. Dropping a phone onto a single point on a hard rock is probably some of the hardest force your phone can experience, assuming you're not throwing it at s***, and this screen protector took it like a champ. I would recommend this 100%."
"Excellent item and service,we are in need of sellers with the same conduct of business as Falcon itech TM.<br />Keep it real, bless!"
"This case appears well made but I won't be using it anytime soon.  I'm writing this review just to say that my Galaxy S5 will not fit with the protective case (Galaxy S5 Case, Verus® [Thor]) I have on it.  Without the protective case I have no doubt that the bare phone would fit nicely but the Verus helps me hang onto an otherwise slippery phone so I'm keeping it and continuing to use other phone holsters."
Adhered to the screen all by itself. No rubbing necessary. Amazing!
"Gift for my Daughter, she was very pleased with the performance, of these headphones, and she is very picky."
I have this stuck to my vans console and it is nearly vertical. My phone sticks to it with no problem.
Was delivered when promised. Great product
a tool in the set did take off the back screw down on my watch but I have not used many of the tools from the set. they lok funtional though. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the next time i use a tool.
"These screen protectors go on easy with no bubbles and are clear.  Some smudges but what do you expect, it's glass!!!"
"Came apart at the seams just over a month of use.  Basically, as other reviewers here have noted, it has a tendency to overheat, plus the head separates from the rest of the cord exposing the wires inside.  Although past the return date, it is still covered by warranty.  A quick online chat with customer service and I recieved a refund.  No need to return the defective item, as it is listed as discontinued.  A newer version of it is available, but a quick scan of the reviews shows the same design flaws.  I'll take a pass on it, thanks.<br />Seems strange that Amazon would put its name on such a shoddy product."
just as ordered but they forgot the ties ? but still its a great case to keep all those travel cable well organized
this is an awesome idea and product - perfect placement
"Best one,  put on dash smooth area grips nice and easy release easy tabs, easy to place so it grips.<br />You will have to put in upside down and turn unit if you want to charge it holder covers plug in for S5 phone."
Price - great.  Ease of installation  - great.  Fit and performance - Great!  I'm not paying $50 for a high end brand name again.  This works just as well and if it gets scuffed or old looking it's cheap enough to just buy another.  Much easier than those not-really-a-warranty warranties the other manufactures profess to have.
It is a good screen protector but in a week it cracked a little from the corners and the second time I dropped my phone it created a line in the middle.
Case looks great definitely water proof!  I am not a big fan of the front flip gets in the way for the most part.  Does not stay open so you have to constantly hold it open.  Would have given a higher rating but the flap gets quite annoying.
"Clever product, uses stiction and air pressure to attach the glass plate. My only quibble is with the instructions - if you only use one of the hinges to secure the plate for flipping back onto the phone face you will almost assuredly have a misaligned protector (as I do). This is only a cosmetic issue, but it's irritating. Use of two of the hinges supplied with the protector will produce a much better result."
"Very poor quality.  Case fits, but is not snug on my iPhone 5c.  Color and design is wearing/scratching off after just 2 days of use.  I guess you get what you pay for."
"I had high expectations for this power bank, considering the price, and so far it's lived up to those expectations 100%. It's every bit as sturdy and tough as the description makes it out to be -- and yes, I've tested its waterproof-ness. I've charged an iPhone 6 twice and an iPad Air 2 once so far and it still shows half charge -- awesome! I'm thinking I'll be able to charge the iPhone at least 4 more times before actually having to charge this power bank.<br /><br />As for size -- it's definitely on the hefty side (length, width, and weight). But, you're not buying this to slide in your pocket -- you're buying it to keep you going in the great outdoors where anything is possible.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is one that rings true for almost all these power banks -- only one port is 2.1A for fast charging and the other is 1.5A, which is fairly slow for the larger capacity batteries on the new Galaxy phones, Sony phones, and any tablet. Other than that, which isn't a huge deal, I have zero complaints. I'm giving it 5 stars and would recommend it for preppers, hikers, backpackers, campers, and anybody else who loves to spend life outside.<br /><br />** I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This is my unbiased review. If I thought it was junk, I'd be using this space to tell you to avoid it. **"
Great case offering that offers excellent drop protection.  Fits perfect and is very easy to put on and take off.
Love this case. Easy to clean. Withstands many falls to the floor.<br />The flip-open option is neat but also needed to use with my accessories.
"Perfect fit, looks amazing. Doesn't pull the hair as per other reviews and as I had thought it would, May be because I have adjusted the band size for a proper fit and not loose. Easy to remove the pins for size adjustment."
Nice comfortable and stylish watch wish it had a few more function's  but for the price you cant beat this watch
The best screen savers for my Samsung S II Phone for the price and that I have been able to find yet! 😀
didn't receive any of the lens. i'm disappointed i wasted money on this. definitely recommend you don't buy this product
"I love the design and it is certainly good protection for my iPad, but it is a bit heavy to carry on a daily basis."
Finally a product that works! After trying several other manufacturers I came across Touch Charge and my charging problems with my iPhone 6 Plus have been eliminated thanks to this device. Excellent job Touch Charge keep up the good work !A charger that finally works!  Be sure to buy the case with your phone that works in conjunction with the charger it's a perfect combo.
"the design and colors for this case is so pretty. However, I was a little disappointed when I received the case and noticed it didn't have a front magnetic clasp to keep the case shut. Overlooked this when looking at the images before purchasing. If you don't mind the case not having a flap to keep it closed then this will be fine for you. I ended up purchasing another case with a flap to keep it closed."
I've had this case for about three days now and it's great. Does what a case is suppose to do without adding bulk or hiding the iPhones sleek look. Logo is on the side so it won't show up on the back like most cases. Fits snug and has good grip when holding so you know it won't slide out of your hand
"I received my Asus as promised, when I turned on the phone for the first time, TALKBACK -ACCESSIBILITY was annoying as HELL. This accebility should be disable before shipping.  Battery life not so great for the price i can't complaint.  Still testing...."
Great fit. Best case for g stylo on the market:) if you use your phone very often ( for work) this is the right case for you;) it doesn't make your phone bulky and it fits perfect
"Great product, but terrible shipping methods.  It took 10 days to receive the case, all because I wouldn't buy into Amazon's prime program.  Disappointed with Amazon's tactics of making you wait unless you buy-in oppressive shipping rates or their high priced Prime deal.<br /><br />FWIW the case fits perfectly on my Xperia Z3v."
Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone
Case is great. However the plastic protective shield to cover the screen (Clear plastic) I mared up from a sticker attached to it. Looks bad & unclear in that area (top Portion). Can that be replaced? Both phones the same way.
"This is pretty good if you just need a bit of juice, but alot of style. This is the best looking battery case out there, but not the biggest battery to charge your phone. It does not fully protect the phone. It leaves the sides and top exposed. I would recommend this for people who just needs that little extra charge without compromising design. I would suggest either Mophie or UNUcase for more battery and better protection."
Awesome product. Even better customer service.  Bottom line... I broke the suction portion of the product.  They offered a replacement product even though it was my fault it broke.  They even did overnight delivery.  wow! Can't get any better support than that.
I researched a ipod holder for my car for a while before deciding on this one.  It's been a good choice.  I've had it for about a year.  It is pretty adaptable so you can position both the arm and the apparatus at whatever angle you want.  It isn't super heavy so it stays in place well.  I would recommend this product.  UPDATE: One drawback - there is a styrofoam-like substance glued to the edges of this (softening the area where the ipod slides in).  After a hot summer I noticed it was peeling away from the plastic.  I had to glue it back on.  More ofa nuissance than a major drawback tho.
"It came on time just as promised. It is a great protector for my phone. My one gripe is also the best feature. I am glad that the phone grips the case, but that also makes it difficult to get the phone out quickly. With the phone gripping the case so tightly you know it won't fall out. With the stands to prop it up on flat surfaces that just makes this the best product for the HTC Desire 526."
Worked as advertised. Nice to have a choice of wind-shield or air vent.
Transmit audio sounds like you are talking through a sock! Taking the mic apart and opening up the hole the sound travels through helps. Better than that is to replace the condenser element with the one Radio Shack still sells. The sad part is that the cost of the replacement condenser is 3/4 the price of the speaker mic!
"This is a great product! We bought this to go on vacation to Florida and it was one of the best purchases we made. It rained constantly in Florida and or course there was the beach. We got plenty of use out of this. The only thing I didn't like was how big and bulky it was, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. Great product!"
It's best cable ever I bought. You will never disappoint from it. I will buy it whenever I need.
Sweet charger barely bigger than iPad charger but with 5 ports. Very well made
Excellent all-around product with great pricing and shipping time frame actions.
I love my Up Move.<br />I decided to purchase this after receiving a little push from my best friend who purchased a different Jawbone product.<br />I was initially sold on buying another well known brand however after reviewing the differences in features I went along with her and purchased this Jawbone.<br />There are several things that I love about this little gadget.<br />First the size. Its super small and works great being clipped onto your clothing.<br />Im a nursing mom so I initially would clip it to my bra however that became more of a chore so I decided to use the wristband which I plan to review also. I love the option of being able to use it either way however the Jawbone bands design is horrible.<br />So back to this little gadget.<br />I also love the fact that it is wireless. That was a plus for me. My friend has a different model jawbone that has to be plugged into her phone however mine connects via bluetooth and that takes the work out of having to remember to upload data each day.<br />I also love that I receive daily reports regarding my activity and I'm able to track what i'm doing constantly and also compare it to what my friend is doing. We use that for a little weekly friendly competition.<br />Overall I've been very happy with my Up Move.<br />My only complaint is the battery life which seems to be pretty short.<br />I wish the batter lasted just a tad bit longer<br />My other complaint is regarding the strap that is made for the up move  ( purchased separately)<br />The strap does not stay on. The design is one big flaw and causes the band to constantly come off.<br />Other than that this is a great gadget to help you to stay on top of getting those steps in daily!!
great case just don't care for the screen protector. its not easy to put on and u have to make sure to get it flat on or there are bubbles in between.
"Brand new, without any scratch or whatever. Sincerely, much more that what I expected. Thank you"
Love it! My favorite case
"The only criteria that this product met was that it's full coverage, all of the other claims are wrong. 1. It's not scratch proof, I have not even had it for one day and it has scratches already. 2. It has bubbles all over the screen, and I followed all the instructions. thank you stealing my money EDIT: So as I wrote up here I had problems with my screen protector, but the costumer support contacted me saying that It was most likely product with factory flaws, so they sent me a replacement, and they were right, the replacement they sent is flawless, I loved it (: it fits perfectly."
"Great case looks and feels and fits PERFECTLY, if u need a case this is the one looks like I paid $100 ,it looks that good"
"I just received my screen protector today and was eager to try this thick tempered glass for my newly bought LG G3. Installation is easy but my problem is it doesn't fit my entire screen. I'm disappointed, I had high hopes for this screen protector but I'm missing 8 mm for the bottom."
"This gadget is awesome! Didn't notice when I purchased it, but hell... Had myself a phone call in the shower! All around pretty awesome!"
This is beyond a great case for your iPhone protection. I got my iPhone less than a month. I left the phone on the roof of my car and drove away at about 55 mph. My phone flew off and landed on the side of the road and this case did an amazing job protecting my phone. There are only scratches around the case corners and nothing happened to my phone. Thank you Spigen.
"The ear pieces are comfortable & easy to sync, but the battery life!!! Only a few hours and the little voice in my ears starts telling me the battery is low. And once that starts it is only a few minutes before it turns off"
Nice flip case for Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 Fits perfectly the phone is really protected with this case on with the S View Window makes looking at time and quick messages with a breeze every port is easily accessible
My husband really likes it. It seems to work well with his iPhone 6 plus except for the texting features I knew were likely not available
I love this unit.  So far I have tried every feature (except directly connecting my phone - though I've paired it with BT) and they work flawlessly.  Only weird thing is there is a slight delay from when you tap the screen and when the function actually happens.  Same thing also occurs when you first turn it on.  Mine did not come with a manual but you can download it here http://www.jensenmobile.com/mobile-multimedia/?sku=VX4022.  Cheers
"Product is very slim, which is what I wanted. It doesn't add much to the original size of the phone.  Won't protect the screen much though if damaged."
"Worked well for the first few months.  Eventually failed.  Has lifetime warranty, but there is nobody to to talk to to replace it."
Great replacement for the cracked lens on my Sprint Note 4. Pretty easy to install with the help of YouTube.  My phone focuses much better now and takes great pictures again. Haven't had a problem with it scratching easily. It's a well made product!
"Love it!  I already had one in brown and wanted one in blue.  I have had several compliments.  Fast service, too!  Will definitely order again."
"Works great without adding bulk to original thickness like the qi charging battery cover does, thus giving you more options when it comes to buying cases.  Works great and Chris quickly"
"This buds are great if you don't move around. I talk on the phone with them and when I put my phone in my pocket, the line gets full of static. It doesn't matter what shorts I wear or if I'm inside or outside. If you just want to listen to music they do the job."
"Works great, I bolted it to my hat for hunting. I sanded the ball for a smoother action. The 1/4-20 threads on my mount were fine (unlike another reviewers)"
"This 4 foot long cable works perfectly with our daughter's iPhone 5c and our son's iPhone 6 (4.7).<br /><br />It was delivered right on time and in perfect condition. Nice fit on both, and it feel substantially built especially in comparison to the thinner plastic cables we have had. Even works just fine with the cases both have on their phones.<br /><br />If you are looking for a high quality, Apple certified, 4 foot long lightning cable for your Apple equipment, based on our kids' experience with this one we highly recommend trying this Letouch product.<br /><br />Excellent trouble-free cable so far.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller, without obligation, and have decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing review reflect that testing experience."
Used for my Garmin Fish Finder.  Holds a charge for up to a year.  (that is with out using the Fish Finder)
"The product works really well, as long as I kept it plugged in to charge. Unplugged, there was a lot of interference. Still, that's a small problem and overall I am very happy with it. Sadly, it started acting up after about a month of use. However, the customer service completely made up for it, replacing the product without complaint. I'm extremely satisfied and would definitely buy products from them again."
Very good.Works in my S5.
"GARBAGE, Absolute garbage!  Charging a premium price for a piece of junk like this is shameful. Tip completely separated from cable after second use.  I have no reason to believe this is a counterfeit, it's Belkin making a junk product.  A counterfeit might actually work better."
"Do not buy if you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I read a review that said it worked great. It came in, the glass does not match up evenly with Samsung at the top of the phone. It does line up with the front camera or has a slot for the camera but it is too short and won't go all the way to the top."
I like the case but the belt clip broke the first 5 minutes.  Fortunately Amazon and the Mfr refunded my purchase.
"Update: Customer service did a very good job in sending me another band. The second worked fine, but, it still doesn't fit perfectly the watch width and the band is longer than the original one. I moved from 1 to 3 stars because good service means a lot to me.  This is a product I bought to give as a gift to my son. The product clasp doesn't fit perfectly into the watch case. O, well, you should consider that the price is much lower than Apple's original one. That's still OK. However, one of the clasps doesn't LOCK into place in the watch case. You may even lose your watch if you're not attentive enough. Do I know how to handle it? Yes, I personally have the original one from Apple. I have not done anything wrong. As the full customer experience is not limited to the product functionality itself, I will update the review to let everybody know how the customer service will handle my return and my refund. The review can still be upgraded."
"Works great. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing. Stays in place. I've been super sweaty hiking in Arizona in the summer, doesn't budget. Phone is protected and has never come out of the casing wet. Like the other reviews say, a very thin case can fit inside. I have Galaxy 6 Ringke Slim case and it fits right in. I wear the armband usually about 4 times a week, hiking, lifting weights, doing stadiums, works well in every situation. My 1 complaint is that the little piece at the end of the arm strap, that weaves through so you can adjust the armband to your arm, is peeling back. The material has separated from the foamy armband, but just at that very end. Hopefully it won't keep peeling back and just stays right there at the end.  Had this since the end of May 2015."
THE PROTECT PLASTIC  IS BEGER FOR THE BLU PHONE. SO I HAVE CUT SOME OF THE PLASTIC.
"ok , good idea but not very rugged. Broke within 1 weeks use."
"Bad fit, wish otter made case for maxx."
The grip units on the back and side make it easy to hang onto.  Fits phone perfectly without adding to much to the overall size.
Like the case except I can not slide the mute button with the case
"I am a woman with a tiny wrist, so I was worried that this watch (or any smartwatch) would look ridiculously big on my wrist. It's a bit big, but I love it! I wear it pretty loose so my wrist doesn't get sweaty.<br /><br />I love the way this watch looks, feels and functions. It charges super fast, so I can wear it all day, charge it for a bit, track my sleep, charge it a bit in the morning and it rarely goes below 50% charge.<br /><br />I found a Star Trek: TNG themed watch face that I love and looks great in the low power, black and white mode."
Great buy!  Good fit and easy to adjust.
Bought this and it does not fit my lg stylo phone so not liking that at all. If they companies dont test these on the phones first why sell them waste of time and money
"I like everything about it except for when I take pictures with flash. I thought something was wrong with my phone. When I take pictures with the flash while the case is on, my pictures have an orange hue to them. So I either have to be in a place with great lighting or deal with the orange hue."
Car charger and wall charger work well.  The usb one is not the same size as the others and does not fit the phone.
My mom was super happy with this. She still uses this case. Im so glad that I was able to get this for her.
"I love,very privacy,no body,see,my screen,1000% recomended,"
"I don't feel that the clear case offers much protection but my daughter has a gold iPhone and refuses to use a case to protect it because she doesn't want to cover up the phone case, which makes sense but  this phone cost a lot of money.<br />I was glad to get this for review, it is perfect for her to protect the finish on the phone without covering up her 'beloved' gold case, it makes me worry a little less that i twill get scratched up or broken.<br />However, we also have the black case with card holder and this case is fantastic, looks sleek and very functional."
"The video instructions for application were perfect and somehow I was able to apply it bubble free. I did have to use the other &#34;tools&#34; included which were just pieces of sticky tape, and sticky tabs. The privacy function kinda works; viewing the screen from the sides makes it way to dark to see unless you are directly looking at the front of the screen. However, even when looking at the screen directly, it made the screen much darker so I have to turn the brightness up in order to see, draining my battery. I also wouldn't suggest this dark privacy screen protector on a WHITE phone such as mine. It just looks funny and cheap. I am going to look for a clear privacy screen but for now, this will work."
"So I've had these for 5 months and find that they have some of the best battery life of my bluetooth headsets.  I mainly use them for audio books so cannot say the quality for music but the volume is good and clear.  I barely can use the for phone functionality though because of the poor mic.  I usually switch to handheld or say that I will call back if I cannot switch.<br /><br />I use these for 2 to 3 days listening off and on while doing chores, walking, sometimes driving (though I will pull one side off my ear to be able to hear outside better), etc..., before need to charge them.  This is hours of use, I can get through at least one book, which on average are 9-10 hours and then some.<br /><br />Little complaint- the blue light is too bright and quite distracting, especially inside and in darker rooms.<br /><br />Great headset, poor mic, great battery life"
"My original Garmin was stolen, probably when the shop detailed it.  I searched and even bought another one which had to be returned to another company.  This Garmin has worked very well plus it has traffic information.  Lifetime maps, etc.  The size is perfect.  The case I wanted is no longer made so that was disappointing but the Garmin is a great item."
"Do not buy from this company. I just relieved my iPhone case and it is complete junk. First if all, it says it's a speck case. It most definitely is not. The word 'speck' is just screen printed on the cheap plastic cover.  The picture shows impact rubber along the edges. False.  It doesn't have any.  It's literally the cheapest, flimsiest case I have seen. Do not waste your money."
Great case.  Great price
"Overall the case is great for the money with one flaw... It does not lay flat when the phone is facing up on a hard/flat surface. I understand the Moto G has a curved back but if you lay the phone down and try to use it, it just wobbles back and forth or spins.<br /><br />Ill be looking for a new case even thought I like everything else about."
"Zerolemon continues to release great, economical products. In the pack are 3 screen protectors, individually packaged with a small squeegee and micro fiber cloth. Installation is very simple and straight forward. I had to lift my protector the while applying as a small dust particle was on the screen. I lifted the protector with a piece of tape and used another doubled over piece of tape to remove the particle.<br />The fit is great and covers the full face of the phone nicely. These protectors are a bit thinner than the glass shields and my clear phone case fit just right.<br />I've had the protector on my phone for right and three weeks now and have had no issues with edges lifting or peeling up. The PET protectors are silky smooth and I think my responsiveness is much better than the glass shields.<br />I have had no issues with scratching or discoloration, or haloing. I typically clean my screen once or twice a day with the same spray cleaner I use for my eyeglasses and my protector still looks and functions good as new.<br />Another great Zerolemon product!"
"I got this stereo for the Subwoofer output. The output doesn't work, I'm getting no sound from my subs. Pretty frustrating."
This is a beautiful case it's exactly what I wanted. I recommend this to anyone. It fits perfectly and it's a wonderful color.
the shipping was very fast. i love how this case has a frosted back and the pink sides are really cute but my case broke 2 days later and it came bent sideways.
"I like it, only issue is that the borders are somewhat annoying when swiping pages, but I guess there is nothing that can be done as the edge of the iphone 6 is curved and the screen protector surface is flat and can not reach the curved part..."
👍Im very satisfied with my screen protector. It was easy to put on. Now my boyfriend wants one for his phone. 👍
"I don't know if it's my smart phone and my touch screen laptop or these pens but they only work some of the time.  The tip is a bit too wide which causes the same problems as using my finger - overlap of contact with keys.  If you expand your screen before tapping they work better, but the point was to make touch screen operation easier."
Overall I like the  cover.  The only problem with this product is the stick on clear screen.  It is almost impossible to put it on straight and get all the bubbles out from under it.  A tempered glass screen would work much better and wouldn't be near as frustrating as trying to put that darn thing on.
"The fabric coating worked so well at the beginning, but slowly it's worn out and ripped off from the head, exposing the inner plastic coating."
Metal. Heavyweight. Lots of adjustment angles. I use it every night when watching/listening to shows. Doesn't pull off the nightstand easily so I don't have any worries if I fall asleep with the headset connected to the phone. The edges are padded so it does not scratch a surface if it does slide.
"In terms of price vs. functionality, this is the best smart-watch currently available.  There are simply no two ways about it.  It has many features; but the most important is robust voice-command functionality.  It is also stylish; people often ask me, &#34;is that an Apple Watch?&#34;  I tell them, &#34;no; it's about a quarter of the price.&#34;  This is especially satisfying if the asker is wearing an Apple watch.<br /><br />The point of a smart-watch, as far as I can tell, is to keep you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket.  This watch accomplishes that purpose, with aplomb.  The watch includes a built-in speaker, so that you can take calls on it.  You talk, and it talks back to you.  You don't think you will ever need or use this feature... until you need it.  I swore I would never take a call on my watch; but sometimes, you find that it's just convenient.<br /><br />The built-in speaker dovetails nicely with the watch's most important feature: voice control.  When paired with my LG G2, running the latest version of Android, I can use its voice command feature to initiate Google Now.  It works, even if the phone is locked, in my pocket.  This means that I can send text messages, check the weather, look up and call phone numbers, convert weights and measures on the fly, and more, without ever having to touch my phone in my pocket.  This, in my opinion, is the best feature of this, or any, smart-watch.  I've taken to text messaging my wife during the day, while I'm working, just because this watch makes it easy; certainly easier than picking up my phone to fiddle with a touch keyboard.  It goes like this:<br /><br />Me: &#34;Text message to Scout Finch mobile: 'hi, honey; just checking in to say I love you.' &#34;<br /><br />Sykla M1: &#34;Here is your text message to Scout Finch: 'Hi, honey, just checking in to say &#34;I love you.&#34; ' Do you want to send it?&#34;<br /><br />Me:  &#34;Yes.&#34;<br /><br />Sykla M1: &#34;Sending message.&#34;<br/><br />The heart-rate function works; something I cannot say for, e.g., Zeaplus's DM360.  Alarm, pedometer, SMS, also work.  You have seven [stylish!] watch faces to choose from; you can even set up a different face for each day of the week.  Switching them on the fly is easy; most days, I just pick one based on my mood.<br /><br />Let's talk about the hardware  The build of the watch is solid.  It's constructed of metal, and hard plastic; the band is an attractive leather.  It is not flimsy; I have banged it, scraped it, and abused it in any number of ways, without impacting functionality.  The watch is truly waterproof; you will have a devil of a time using the touchscreen if there are a few beads of water on it; but, you can submerge it, and keep it under, and it does just fine.  I would say that it takes a licking and keeps on ticking, but strictly speaking, it does not tick.<br /><br />The hardware for this watch is manufactured by MIMI Sangfeida, in China; but, rather than buying direct, I recommend this version, which is rebranded by &#34;Rezilient Company LLC&#34; in Georgia.  The watches faces available with the M1, seven in total, are much more stylish than the ones that come with the Chinese version.  I typically advise buying goods direct from China, rather than on Amazon, to save money; but, in this case, it make sense, because the Sykla's better watch-faces add value, without adding much to the price.<br /><br />Nitpicky issues: you have to be in pedometer mode, for the pedometer to work; otherwise, your steps will not be recorded.  Long SMS messages don't always come through; you will see a truncated version on the watch.<br /><br />The cheapest Android Wear smartwatch right now is the LG G Watch; which, if you are a savvy shopper, can be found for around the same price as this watch.  But, it doesn't have a built-in speaker.  This one does; and, because it works with Google Now, it basically includes all the features of an Android Wear device.  Buyit.  Love it.  Gloat about how much less you paid.  If you want to drop more coin on an Android Wear watch later, more power to you.  But, this one does everything you need it to do."
I thought it was a privacy protector but people can still see my screen so I'm not satisfied with it
"Excellent price, excellent quality. It was not too bulky and my dad found it acceptable, which means it is great. It actually looks very sleek and modern. On regards to safety, it appears very sturdy and fits the phone well. I definitely recommend it."
Very loud. easy to work. Lasting battery.
Didn't work for my lg g3 at all. Screen would not activate on case was on. Case looked sturdy by was useless to me because it didnt allow my phone to work
i love the colors but it doesnt fit on my phone and it really annoys me so i wouldn't buy another one of these cases again
"I bought Liger wireless bluetooth earbuds earphones for my  gym day.I do like listening music while exercising  but  I always having problem with the other headphones Ive used if not too big or because of the wire and keep distracting me on my exercising.<br />Since I have this Liger wireless bluetooth it solved my problem.This is very comfortable,with control button .<br />I got this product at discounted price."
"I have used C4 company model Q cases, and like them very much for holding business cards.  The SLITE model is cheap looking silicone, rather than textured faux leather. Also, the card slot is not wide enough to hold business cards- just credit card or ID."
"Very fancy, has endured quite a bit so far.  Pleased with the product."
It was good headset but don't buy if you wear glasses
"This product went beyond my expectations. I don't leave reviews but when I got an e-mail requesting to do so, I jumped right on it. You won't be disappointed by investing in this case."
Got this case as a gift...it arrived in a timely manner and the person loved it! Glad the Star of Life Defender case was finally made available for iPhone 6!!
"When I first bought this product I thought it would be a cheap poorly made speaker but it turned out when I received it, it was already partly charged and I had no problems connecting it to my phones Bluetooth. The sound was surprisingly loud for its compact size. The suction cup on the bottom worked perfectly fine on my wall and my window. On the device there are volume up, volume down, and play/pause buttons. There is also an on/off switch and a led light indicator. Overall this is a great product for the price."
"Great in theory, but doesn't work well enough to rely on. Gets really hot and only charges my iPhone 1/3 of the time. Also very slow."
"Great case that looks good and great protection. With a couple flaws.<br /><br />1) The rubber part that goes on first is to soft and moves around, also creates a pocket grabber trying to take in and out of your pocket.<br /><br />2) The power button is hard to push. It's too flush abs you really need to push hard to use it.<br /><br />3) This isn't really a flaw but a notice to others. The orange color is close but not like the pic. It's more of a yellowish orange. Which isn't bad but I was expecting the orange in the pic. Again this isn't a flaw just a heads up for others.<br /><br />I would've given it 3 stars because of the flaws but considering this is only 7.99 with prime shipping I gave it 4 stars. Hard to beat it for the price and this level of protection.<br /> I would have preferred the hard plastic or a stiffer rubber around the top and bottom to keep it from grabbing my pocket.<br /><br />Oh and as far as size goes I would consider it close to a otter box defender. But looks way better imo."
No NFC = no flagship
"I love this case, with one reservation: It is not convenient for holding cash. Bills must be folded more than once, and then they're too thick to insert into the case. However, other cases aren't any better in this regard, and this is the most aesthetically pleasing case I've seen offered."
"This product is very simple to install and fits seamlessly to the Galaxy Note 5. The kit comes with an alcohol wipe, microfiber cloth, 2 dust remover stickers, and 1 glass screen protector. I first cleaned the phone with the alcohol wipe, wiped it off with the microfiber cloth, and then used a dust remover sticker over the entire surface of the screen. After cleaning the phone, I lined the glass screen protector up and placed it flat upon the phone. It will gradually &#34;suction&#34; to the screen of the phone - this is a huge improvement from the sticky plastic screen protectors that you had to gradually apply and almost always resulted in a few bubbles. There was one air bubble left over after the glass protector suctioned to the screen, and I was easily able to slide it out through the periphery with my microfiber cloth. The glass protector is exceptionally clear and feels just like the phone screen. I have not noticed any color distortion with this product. There is about a 2 mm margin between the edge of the screen protector and the edge of the phone, but I did not feel this to be terribly noticeable. I think the margin is actually a perk because it prevents you from applying the protector too close to the edge, which would inevitably prevent the edges of the protector from laying flush against the screen. I would absolutely purchase this product again in the future."
"A selfie stick is a handy thing to have and this one is easy to use, plus the price is right. You do have to ensure that the cord is inserted all the way in order to snap the pic. The one complaint that I have about this style selfie stick is that, while keeping my phone secure from dropping, the hinged area hits right where the power button is on my Android Galaxy Avant phone so, if I'm not careful, it presses on the power and turns my phone off."
"You get what you pay for. These can't be as good as Bose or perhaps a few other much more expensive choices, but for the roughly $100 price range they offer great value and quality. Meanwhile, if you have a larger head, these might be not as comfortable. Finally, they don't seem to isolate up to 94% or so of background noise as claimed, but still, they are good and worth the $100."
I own jay birds i love them but i was shocked at quality of these for price would buy again.
"I wore these twice, and I was very disappointed. They're heavy and didn't fit well in my ears (even when I swapped the ear bud pieces for my second run with them). The sound quality was poor, and the signal strength connecting with my iphone was disappointing. The purchase was an unfortunate waste of my money; my regular ear buds work so much better."
"FINALLY -- a long cable that works well with a Dell Venue 11 Pro.  I tried at least 6 other cables until finding this one, and it's the ONLY one I've tried (other than the ridiculously short Dell cable)) that will allow my DV11P to charge while in use.  This is not the cheapest cable out there, but I probably would have saved money in the long run if I'd just bought this first instead of wasting time trying all the others.  The green connector actually makes it easy to quickly spot the right cable in my bag, which is an unexpected plus."
It was really nice for a couple of days. It did make me lose service every once in a while. But after only a few days of use it no longer charges my phone. It just doesn't power on. I'm going to find a better one.
"It only works good with the fast charger. If not then it keeps cycling (charging then stop charging, then charging) which is bad for the battery. might as well connect it to the fast charger at that point..."
"My initial review after having this for a day or so. I will update my review in about two weeks after having used it day in and day out.<br /><br />Right out of the box it's very attractive and easy to set up. I love that I can use it three different ways. Wear it as a bracelet, on my clothing or as a necklace! I work in a hospital so being able to wear it on my person is very helpful especially with all of the gloves and hand washing I do!<br /><br />As of right now it's a very simple activity tracker that appears to only have two alarms and a pill reminder. As for accuracy of the &#34;steps&#34; taken throughout the day I can't really say just yet and I will include that in my updated review two weeks from now.<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't appear to be able to sync with ihealth app (iPhone). Although, I'm hoping that since it's so new that it will be an added feature in the firmware.<br /><br />Would like more than two alarms. So far that doesn't seem to be an option but also hoping that's included in future firmware updates.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!<br /><br />I've used it constantly for about a week and have decided to update my review earlier than I said I would.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Beautiful<br />Can wear with anything (dressy or casual)<br />Easy to wear<br />Secure and does not feel like it will fall off<br />Love that I don't have to charge it every so often<br />Easy to sync<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not accurate (steps or sleep)<br />Not able to manually edit my sleep (explanation below)<br /><br />Does not sync with apple iHealth app (yet?)<br />Only three (3) alarms<br /><br />Ok, now for the explaining! As I previously mentioned I work in a hospital so I get a lot of steps in! Sometimes about 12k (12,000) but on average 10,500 or so. The leaf has been about 2k to 3k steps off which is a lot.<br /><br />I don't like that the app is glitchy, I tried to adjust my slee since one night I went to bed at 9pm. The app was glitching out on me and would change the time to AM as opposed to pm! Strange, but I guess it's to be expected from a first generation product? I still like a lot but as far as accuracy goes I'm really hoping that the programmers will fix the bugs and fine tune it soon as well as add the additional alarms and make it compatible with Apple iHealth.oes I'm really hoping that the programmers will fix the bugs and fine tune it soon as well as add the additional alarms and make it compatible with Apple iHealth."
I love these cases because I can create my own case.  I just insert a design on paper in between my phone and the clear case.  I change this up every now and then when I want something new.
"Works great and it will keep my S3 useful for another year or 2, saves me from buying another phone. And for the price, can't beat it"
"I don't normally write negative reviews, but this stuff smells SO bad that I can't even use it after the first time. I bought it for work since I'm in healthcare and we're going to a tablet based system for documentation. I figured between patients I would want an antibacterial cleaner not just the 'iclean' I've used for years for my phone. I tried it out on my iPhone upon opening it and it just smells terrible - I had to use my other cleaner to try to get the scent off but it took 4 tries over about 3 hours. It smells like B.O. and honesty like feces. And others around you will smell it too - it's strong. I really would save your money."
"I read all these great reviews and was excited to receive my product.  I'm not sure if I just got a lemon, but the volume buttons (left side of the phone when holding it as if to talk) on this case do not align properly with the buttons on my Samsung Galaxy S6.  As such, I can  only turn the volume up when the case is on, unless I use the touch screen.  I will be returning the case immediately because it does not fit properly."
"Everyone these days has a phone, but it has become a hazard to keep it in a pocket with people around who may do things like shove you into a pool or turn on the garden hose. Thank goodness I had my phone in my waterproof iPhone case by u deserve tech, because this happened to me just the other day. My husband and I were playing outside with the kids with the garden hose. It was hot and everyone was getting wet. I had my phone in it's case in my pocket, My husband suddenly turned the hose on me and laughed when I got soaked. It took him a minute to stop and realize my phone was with me and asked if it was okay or if we needed to sit it in a container of rice. I pulled it out and showed him it was in my case safe and sound. He was relieved but soaked me again. It worked fantastic. No issues with leaking or anything. A nice high quality case. Keep yourself safe from people and water. Because no warranty these days covers water damage.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED OR ALTERED IN ANY WAY"
"This case is perfect.  Very thin, very flexible and soft.  The clear one shows off the Note 5 very well.  Provides secure grip.  The phone is very slippery without a case.  It would probably slip out of my hands without this case.  The S Pen is easy to grab with this case."
"I ordered this along with the 8400 model and the 24 watt wall charger.  I wanted it for power outages as well as travel.  The products arrived on time and with all the goods included. This unit came 75% charged but charged to 100% within a couple of hours.  Instructions were easy to understand and carry out.  I will keep this one at home and use the 8400 for traveling.  Both units have a sturdy, qualitative feel to them - like all parts fit like they should, with good quality materials.  I do not anticipate any issues with this unit."
"I had another case from amazon on my phone but it was getting worn out from a year of use. I bought this one because of its look and thought it would be made the same as my other case.<br /><br />I dropped my phone from 18&#34; and the screen shattered which cost me $130 to get it replaced. I would never recommend this brand to anyone, the case is not slim, it is bulky and does not look near as good on the phone as the stock image. DO NOT BUY"
I have a iPhone 6 plus I used this cord about 15 times and it's now saying my cable not compatible with this cord..😕😕😕. So I would not recommend this cord for a iPhone six plus and I have a iPad Air a Two same thing won't work I'm always looking for the best cords for my phone and this is not one.
"UPDATE 9/27: CHANGED REVIEW FROM ONE TO FIVE STARS.<br />Tech Armor reached out to me and gave me a replacement protector with one day free shipping. I have not applied the new protector yet, but will update when I do.<br /><br />This is the second screen protector I have purchased from Tech Armor and both have not worked out for me. Both of my protectors have not completely adhered to my phone. The top corners aren't stuck down, so there are ugly half moons at the top.<br />Attempting to get a replacement from their site tells me &#34;sorry, but this happens.&#34;<br />Will not purchase again, I learned my lesson."
Perfect high quality and beefier cord than the thin wire that comes with apple devices. i would certainly recommend this cord to anyone. it works with iphone5 and ipad air for charging.
"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Starting with the design, it’s made mostly of a matte plastic that feels really nice and is not slippery at all. There are cut-outs for both mics, the camera, the flash, the charging port, the headphone jack, the IR blaster and finally, the speaker. It comes in two separable pieces, one flimsy piece that fits the phone perfectly, then a hard shell piece that makes the case more durable and protective. Speaking of durability, this case is a great combo between thinness and protection. The corners are padded and all three buttons are protected, but still tactile; to add-on, the case is still fairly thin. The case does not remove any functionality and looks really good. Coming from an expensive Otterbox, I am very impressed with this case, they even included a stylus and a screen protector, with a microfiber cloth! Anyway, thanks for reading my review, bye!"
"I had originally given this product a very positive review, after buying it in July 2015.<br />But unfortunately by November 2015 the device simply died. It had always fed the same two Nexus 7 tablets, which are still alive and well, except it doesn't charge them anymore, nor does the blue &#34;On&#34; light turn on, as if some (inaccessible) internal fuse has blown.<br />BTW the plane's voltage is monitored carefully, and even logged for each flight, and it's always around 27.5v.<br />When you click on &#34;warranty info&#34; for this product on the Amazon site, you get a message &#34;see manufacturer's website&#34;, and on that site I have been unable to find any useful warranty service info.<br />So as bottom line, assuming my experience is typical, this device may work for a while and then die a few months later, with no obvious way to get warranty service.<br />Buyer beware!"
Very nice case
I love these. They're great to ensure your Fitbit stays on and the colors compliment my bands with a splash of color.
"I love the way it looks and the size, and everything was working fine, but it was not powerful enough, so I returned it. if you're looking to buy substantial bookshelf speakers (like these - http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-SP-BS22-LR-Designed-Bookshelf-Loudspeakers/dp/B008NCD2LG), you'll need to spend money on an amplifier anyway. At that point, you're better just getting a normal-size/price integrated amp."
"Great product ,works very good !"
Super! The size u need for iPhone 6!!!!
I have tried this on three different vehicles and it did not work on any of them.  It doesn't fit in the vents properly and the weight of the phone constantly pulls it to a downward viewing angle.  Can't recommend this product at all.
Cannot wait to receive mine this would be helpful when I'm driving and use my phone for gps same time
Product just as advertised. Great merchant
The feel of the material is very cheap. Gonna have to look for something better quality.
"The first set of cables I got had problems but Anker support helped me out. The replacement cables work well and can accommodate a thick case, though mine is very thin. Used the cables daily at work for a year and never had a problem with the pins getting weak."
"I like the case, it looks & feels nice. It wasn't what I pictured it look like especially in comparison to the pictures, but overall it's nice."
Walmart now has this phone for $49. I am stunned a piece of tech this advanced can be purchased so cheaply nowadays. This phone feels like it costs $200+. I broke my galaxy s4 mini and picked this phone up at Walmart. I like this phone equally as much at a fraction of the price. The screen isn't quite as good on  paper but looks just as good as the s4 mini. The camera isn't quite as good but it still takes pretty impressive pics. It handles android 5.1 like a phone that costs 5x the price.<br /><br />I am not sure if there is a way to bypass the activation screen but if so this phone is a steal without even using it as a phone. I rarely write reviews but I am so satisfied I felt I had to share how I felt and hopefully sway a few people that are about to spend hundreds of dollars to just save it.
Great for walking so I'm not holding my phone any more!
Work much better than my expectations. My Garmin Nuvi 65LM fit perfectly in the center of the Nav-Mat and stay secure in the correct position.
Received the product quickly and it is as promised.  Works great and the magnet holds my Galaxy5 no problem.  The unit is compact and fits snug on my air vent.  Thank you!
Rx Audio is a 5-star.  Tx audio is muffled.  Even the typical drilling out the mic hole and removing the splash/air membrane mod isn't very effective.  Otherwise it is OK.
Its an amazing screen protector Iv'e dropped mine about 20 times and ive had it on for a year. Definitely recommend it.
"This case is really nice. It has a smooth edges around the case to give it a sleek style. The case is a made of a an impact-resistant, transparent outer hardshell and co-molded, shock-absorbing inner Diagrid, or diagonal grid core to keep your phone stay safe from dropping and safe from being scratched. This case is easy to put on and feels good in my hands. I would recommend this case. Great price for a great case. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review."
I ordered the case and within three days it was here! Looks great on the tablet it's not bulky at all I love it!
This key board is a piece of garbage if you have a Mac.
Worked good for a while and after 3 days the selfie stck with glue came out and it did not hold the IPhone 6 plus. The company sent me a new one. This worked very well with iphone 6. With 6 plus it is heavy and unsteady but worked great with iphone 6!
All ready broken from taking my phone out to charge.  It's not built to take it in and out from the plastic it should've been rubber to stand the activities.
The phone lasted for three weeks before it started over heating.  I contacted Amazon buat was told it could not be replace because it was a gift.  I contacted the person who ordered for me. They tried to do a return but was told it was too late.  The phone is only three weeks old.
The connection for the micro usb gets loose and makes it hard to charge. I've had it for about a month and have had issues. I've purchase be usb cables a d have the same issue.  there have been a couple of times I wake up and my phone is not charging. If you do get a full charge it will last pretty much all day
"The first one worked great for a few months, then wouldn't hold a full charge. They sent me a replacement right away and it's worked fine ever since. I would suggest they change the case to a softer material like silicone, but it sure is nice to have a battery that lasts several days!"
"Love this case. Fits nicely and love the design, had a few people commenting on it saying they want one."
Love this bluetooth headset.  Wear them at work every day. Sound great and are comfortable. I did have one side stop working not long after getting  them but the company sent me a new pair and they have been good ever since.
"Amazing! Charges insanely fast.  So convenient to not have to carry around any other cords. Literally plug this into a wall when your using your phone then pull it out and plug it to your phone when you need to.  So simple.  Not bulky by any means.  The pouch is great and the adapters are helpful too for your non-iphone devices (though the lightning-to-30pin adapter was made incorrectly and is utterly useless for older iphones because it doesn't fit in an apple 30 pin slot).  The battery indicator light is gives you an idea about how many times you can juice up before having to recharge the pack (I've gotten 4 full charges on my iphone 6 from one full pack).<br /><br />the only concerning thing would be the location of the outlet connector.  Because it's all the way at the top end, if you plug the pack into a horizontal wall outlet it will feel like its putting undue stress on its connectors (almost as if it might bend over time if used this way repeatedly).  this is not to say it's flimsy or anything because this hasn't happened when I've done it.  I've charged it this way a couple of times out of necessity without any issues, but I usually try to find outlets with the slots aligned vertically to be extra nice to my pack and just be safe."
"This case surpassed my expectations. It feels sturdy, has a nice, easy to grip surface, and the magnet closure works well. The only flaw is that the phone holder seems a tiny bit loose on the right side, but that could just be because it's new and a little stiff. It holds the phone snugly, so I don't think that will be a problem. I recommend it."
"I was involved in a motorcycle accident, at 65 mph.  My bike slid five lanes of traffic and I slid three.  When I popped up, the phone was still secured to the mount with the bungee strap.  Very impressed with this mount that I'm going to buy it again for my next motorcycle.  Awesome product.  Highly recommended."
"It's def far better than the cheap craps you can found online, much more sturdy. But, you fit much in it. That is if you put a card in every pocket, you won't be able to close it ."
"Works OK.  The main reason I selected this model is the &#34;Locator&#34; feature it has.  The volume is too low to be heard from more than a couple of feet away.  If I am that close I can probably see the headset!  Will not always connect to my phone, requires turning the headset off/on a couple of times.  Not the quality and reliability I have come to expect from Plantronics.  This is my 3rd Plantronics bluetooth headset, may be my last!!"
Chipped and broke in the bottom right corner after barely dropping my phone.
So far we like this watch however it did take some time trying to get it fully working with our phones
Excellent quality product for price that should outlast other synthetic products three times.
"Phone/batteries still gets hot, but that isn't the batteries fault. However, these replacements are working well even in the heat."
"No problem at all with this charger.  I needed something easily packable and light and powerful, and this fit the bill for a recent trip."
"I bought this to use for the connection between my iPad Mini 2 and my Phantom 3 Professional. This cable is a perfect solution. It is just the right length. Short enough that there is no extra cord dangling around, but long enough to be able to easily connect with a sunshade on the iPad. I bought a different short cable. It created HORRIBLE pixelation of the FPV. This cable provides FPV just as perfect as the way too long Apple cable . This is definitely a must have addition for the P3. Stop looking and buy it."
"The charging range seemed very small, and I had to be picky enough about placing it that it would've been just as easy to plug in a USB cable.  The plug is also very fragile and eventually broke off of mine, right before I would've decided to take it out anyway.  I'd recommend waiting until the new charging standards come out."
"I have had ZERO problems, I have a Samsung Tab 10.1 s3, a Samsung s3 4GLTE handset, a Samsung flip phone CDMA style, a pebble wearable, and Bluetooth Bose speaker hooked up with all the correct Ufone cords.  must be the Apple... I really don't know and don't care for their style or equipment but getting Ufone intelligent cords sure does help."
"This case is awesome! I drop my phone all the time and it protects it very well. I also like the fact that I do not have to carry around my large purse anymore. My id and two other cards fit perfectly in it. I've also been able to squeeze in money as well although its not even when you do so. Overall, I'm very happy with my buy and would buy it again!"
"Slim but very protective, great for a large phone that you don't want to be GIGANTIC with a protective case"
Works great considering I have the galaxy S6 curve. The curved screen presents a problem for most cases. I tried 3 other cases before this one.
Extremely quick shipping. Product is as advertised. Strange thing...shipping information still says this product is still in route to be delivered on future date. Product is definitely a good buy in every aspect. Thanks!
amazing - love it - i never speed - my 88 year old mother tells me I am a hazard because I drive too slow. I like knowing where the &#34;hot spots&#34; are. Great value!
Feels the same as an otterbox. Great quality and protection.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for a review.
"I've not yet tested the answer phone/hang up phone buttons, but this thing is definitely well worth the money you spend on it if you plan on using it to listen to music from your phone/.mp3 player over your car radio. This being said, make sure your device is Bluetooth enabled. iPhones, iPod Touch, and most smart phones/devices do.<br /><br />It's very easy to install. You just plug it into your cigarette lighter, turn it on, set the FM station you want your music to play over, tune your radio into said station, and lastly pair the device you're going to play music on with the FM transmitter (turn on Bluetooth and select &#34;BC-06&#34; from the list of available devices).<br /><br />It sounds more complicated than it really is. It's very easy as long as you have a basic understanding of enabling and pairing with Bluetooth devices on your music device. Comes with an instruction booklet.<br /><br />As far as quality goes, I can hear a bit of static between songs, but as the song plays, it's exceedingly clear. Try a different FM frequency if you have issues with static. It beats listening to the radio in my area and cassettes, no doubt.<br /><br />It's quite easy to switch songs using the side buttons, and the additional USB ports are definitely sweet.<br /><br />It's possible that there are more expensive products out there that would do better. This is the first one I've personally tried. But again, for what you're paying for it, I doubt you'll be disappointed. I know I've used it pretty much every time I get in my truck."
"I did receive item in a timely fashion, but when I went to check connections for the third time with correct wiring, it didn't even turn on. I hear great reviews about it... I guess im just one of the few..."
these speakers replaced the outside speakers on my weekend warrior toy hauler.
"This got stuck in the sim card slot on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and the slot broke while trying to get it out, basically making my phone useless. Luckily I managed to order a replacement sim/sd card slot and fix it myself (only losing the back and options key in the process), but most mobile repair shops would not even attempt the repair and others charged more than the value of the phone for it.<br /><br />Save your phones and don't buy this."
"The case is tailor made for the Bose SoundLink Mini.  The speaker fits snugly into the main compartment.  The charging base, wall plug, and charging cord fit snugly into the top compartment.  Nothing moves when the case is zippered; all is stable.  The case is well constructed for the purpose it serves: keep all parts of the Bose system together and protected from mild impacts and sharps damage.  If there have been tests for severe impacts such as dropping from a height of several feet, I am unaware of the results.  The case has hard walls surrounding the unit which should protect from sharp and blunt impacts, but there is no real padding to insulate the speaker unit from vibrational damage associated with being dropped or thrown off a rack or shelf.  The zipper is good quality and I like the colorful and interesting &#34;Khanka&#34; metal zipper pull.  The small strap and its attachment loop are OK for the empty case but don't seem durable enough to carry the the weight of the speaker.  This is the main area for improvement that I would advise.<br /><br />On the other hand....the Khanka EVA hard case is a good looking, space efficient, well constructed, easy to use and lightweight case. The price is excellent for the features and protection provided:  I highly recommend it.  Let your backpack or suitcase do the rest!"
"Talk about a &#34;Shining Star&#34;!  The photographs don't do it justice!  It is like a beautiful piece of jewelry that accessorizes my hand when I use my phone!  I love, love, love it! ~♡~"
"Good protection and excellent feeling in the hand. I really liked the product and would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the AUX cable. It does not fit when I have the case one, so to use my headphones or hear music in the car I have to remove the case which is really inconvenient for me."
"Very well built case that hardly adds any bulk to the MotoX. Almost feels like it isn't there, and it has also protected the phone from a few small falls."
This cover is such a great color.. too bad that it's not the same as the waterproof back that comes on the phone originally... I have to make sure my phone doesn't get wet with this back cover on. Still does everything it's supposed to
DO NOT BUY. WISH THERE WERE A NO STAR RATING BECAUSE THATS WHAT THIS CASE DESERVES. my phone fell out of my hand. on to its back didn't bounce just flat on its back. considering this case is only on the back I would think it would protect it. well I look down and my phone is shattered glass all over the floor. I can nearly see what I'm type on its so badly cracked. air under the screen glass missing and a bad case on my phone.  couldn't get worse.
PERFECT!!  Fits iphone 6 plus and more. Streamline design and super cute!
"This Galaxy Note 5 case by i-Blason is great.  It is heavy duty, rugged, and durable.  It comes with a belt clip/holster that is secure and swivels.  The black color is perfect for guys like me.  It is very easy to put the phone in the case and it fits like a glove.  I have had it on since it came to me and I even put the screen protector on after I put this case on.  The ports for charging and headpphones are easy to access as is the S-pen.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
Have not melted like the other one I had. Have a 150 amp and a 60 amp fuse in it. 0 gauge in and two 4 gauge out.
it arrived quickly and it's gorgeous. i love that i don't have to carry a separate wallet. it's well made and i love the color.
The batteries would not fit into the cell phone. They were about 1 to 2 mm longer than the original. I am trying to return it to the sender
"This case is &#34;just ok&#34;. I thought it would be nicer, but for 6.00 it's just ok. Not too cheap, but nothing to brag about either."
AWESOME case! Really protects the phone and shows the aesthetics of the design of my 6 plus.
DOES NOT FIT XPERIA Z3 COMPACT. The phone is TOO THICK to fit into the slot. It looks like you can remove the slot and replace it with a wider one. BUT THE WIDER ONE IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR Z3 COMPACT. And heck if I can figure out how to change the slot adapters anyway! Comes with no directions!
Don't waste your money. Had this screen protector for less than 2 weeks and dropped my phone and iPhone screen cracked.
"I had expected the case to be flexible and the glitter to flow more easily, needed slightly less fine powder, ok.  Hadn't realized the time frame for the send"
"I hooked theses up to a old MTX thunder 250 amp. They sound awesome! Clean, clear sound. Would have given 5 but I wish they had more bass. Great for the money."
this is a great device but for some reason it keeps disconnecting from my phone. the ear pieces are a bit uncomfortable but it might just needs to be broke in.
"I was curious to see how efficient the solar charging element would be so I first drained the storage by recharging my smart phone several times, which it did nicely. Then I placed the charger in direct summertime sunshine during cloudless days in San Diego. Even after two full days it was not charged. I returned it for a refund and ordered one without the solar element."
was not white it came in Safire blue/bk it was a gift for someone but the person kept it unsatisfied  not good
"I love the convenience of not having to unplug my phone anytime I need to use it, but the charging is much slower than with a cord and sometimes if it's not settled properly, it won't be charging at all.<br />Still, though, wireless charging is great."
"Worked for the 1st month and 1/2 and slowly the cable would stop charging my phone.I thought it was my phone so i ended up exchanging my phone because i thought it was defected. Now, its been 3 months after and they stopped working. Now the Error say this accessory doesn't work for iphone6 that i have. But now i cant even Return or exchange them because of the 30day policy.. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"
It powers two iPhone 6's or an iPhone + iPad on road trips w/no issues.  We have three and none have had issues.
"This is my first time buying a portable phone charger. I bought this based off of the reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />I haven't had any troubles with this device. I received it the next day after wording (something that has never happened...maybe two days later, but never the NEXT day). It came in a neat little box, complete with the device, a small cord, a dust jacket, and the instructions. I will say that the instructions are crap, hence the 4 stars (I would give it 4.5 stars). I love pictures as much as the next person, but it gave me the bare minimum on how to operate the charger. To save anyone the same confusion, here is what I know:<br /><br />- Charge the device before you officially use it in public. You hook the smaller end of the cord into the device and the larger, USB side into your iPhone wall charger. You will see an orange glow from the device - that means it's charging. The glow will disappear once charging is complete.<br />- If you do not have an android, the provided cord will not work for your iPhone. Use your phone charger cord to connect the device to your phone. Once connected, press the small button (where you originally saw the orange light) to begin charging your phone. It will turn green.<br /><br />Ok, that is out of the way. The charger itself has some weight to it, but it's still light enough to carry around. It fully charges my phone with no issues. I've recently taken it with me on a plane in my personal bag. It fits in my book bag and small purse. Overall, it is a nice, sleek, and useful little gadget."
Supercute.  Love it.  No jewels have fallen off and I have had this for months.
"Very minimal cover.  I really like the color; however, the cover got discolored from use."
I bought this for my dad..he loves it and the color. What a great buy for the work he does!
"It was arrived fast, but my only concern was the size of them... the corners did not stick properly, so I had to even cut them slightly to fit my screen. Still corners are not stick, maybe I have different tablet I do not know."
"I like this item I purchased two, one for me and another for my sister but she did not like her it was too thick for her taste however I love it and I am using it all the time."
The clips break off easily.  Otherwise they are okay but not great.  You get what you pay for.
"A metal stand sized for larger cell phones and tablets.<br /><br />The sturdy aluminum construction has Apple's aesthetic and will look at home in a modern workspace. Having the phone standing up lets you check for updates without picking up the phone (especially with wave-to-wake devices like the Moto X), or maintain the correct angle for photo/video (eg, Facetime). For visually-cued people like me, it also provides a convenient \\""everything in its place\\"" spot for my phone.<br /><br />[ A free sample was provided to me for review. ]<br /><br />The stand's display angle is adjustable, and it locks firmly in place (except when the hinge button is pressed). There are rubber bumpers on the angled part of stand and on the bottom to keep things in place. The stand doesn't display and branding.<br /><br />It's a good fit for my LG Nexus5, where I prefer the phone in the horizontal orientation. For phones under 5\\"", I'd worry the metal of the stand would interfere with the wireless signals (ie, when the stand overlaps the edge of the phone to any major extent). For those of you with larger phones or tablets, this stand is Recommended."
"The USB charging port cutout on the bottom wasn't large enough. I couldn't get the factory charge cable nor my Amazon Essentials cable to flushly connect. If i held it in by hand it would charge, but as soon as I let go the cable popped out. I had to cut off the bottom front trim where the port cutoff is. The cables then fit fine.<br /><br />Also the gold plastic trim is free floating. Paper money tends to get stuck in it when its in my pocket."
"I've been using this case for the past 4 months. It hasn't been off the phone for more than a few minutes since I've got it. I love the card holder feature. I no longer carry a wallet with me, which is great. It holds my driver's license and debit card perfectly and the door opens and closes easily but only when I want it to. Haven't  had any issues with it opening unexpectedly or loosing my cards. I do construction so this case takes more than typical abuse and has stood up to it well. It does make the phone a little bulky but still better than carrying a wallet and a phone."
Bought a couple of these two or three years ago to replace original in-the-car video headsets. Work as well as OEM and much less expensive. Gradually grand kids have out numbered the headsets so we had to get more. Also work well with my TV sound wireless transmitter.
So far good . if its fails after 4-5 month will let you know my dear .
These are cheap Chinese junk. They will not synch with the bluetooth system on my phone. They are poorly made I would not recommend them to anyone.
Batteries didn't last very long and only worked when it wanted to. I don't recommend this product.
"I have now purchased 4 of these units , they are amazing and truly a life saver in places that have limited power outlets . GREAT PRODUCT !"
I got these for my husband for a Christmas gift and they stopped working in less than a month.  And I didn't get a 100% refund for a broken item but had to have a &#34;restocking&#34; fee taken out of the price!
I mlove this case thank you!
"Not unlocked. Bought it for my son, so it was a while before he completed enough for me to look into the issue. T-Mobile can not send text messages with pictures. They say &#34;downloading&#34; but never do. No Internet either. I called tmobile AND HTC. After those conversations, they said the phone was unlocked incorrectly causing them to not be able to correct the issue. Sansung has awesome low end devices now, so I just went to the tmobile store instead. A deal is rarely a deal, now a days."
Product comes with really good instructions which I loved! We attached the cover to my son's iPhone 6 it was a little challenging but eventually we got in on the phone. It took about 30 minutes to apply. We did have a few little bubbles that we could not get rid of but after a few times of removing and putting the cover on we were able to leave only a few little ones and after a day they are all gone and now you can't even tell that a cover is on the phone! Which my son loves. We have tried plenty of phone covers this is definitely the best one yet!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.
"Bought this for my husband.  He loves it. He carries his credit card, license, and some cash in it and carries it on his hip.  Great product because he has lost his wallet twice."
For the price the armband is a great buy. I find it annoying with the headphone cord but that is to be expected. I leave my phone case on and it fits but it's hard to change songs.
"I tried to use this on multiple objects in my room, and I ended up having it sit on my side dresser for awhile after being disappointed. Kind of thick, so if you have an outlet behind something against the wall, be prepared not to use it there or to have it sticking out a good amount. For some reason, some of things I tried to use this on was hard to plug into. Bad planning on my part and even stupidity, but for some reason didnt expect this to be 3 prongs. After having to do some cleaning and moving around, I was able to set this up to my main bedroom light.<br /><br />Setup was a little wonky at first, but it was pretty easy and painless in the long run. Thought I read somewhere that you could walk into room with this, and it would pick up your phone and turn the light on for you. Didn't see this option in setting unfortunately. Man am I satisfied though! There was some disappointed with the setup of things, expectations, and settings.. but overall I would recommend this. So far one of the cheapest routes for this type of thing for lights, and one of the few at this time that work with Amazon Echo. Love it with my Alexa!"
"The Wildtek REPEL Waterproof iPhone 6 Case was packaged nicely, with a microfiber cloth, a wrist band, and clear instructions on how to test for waterproofness and case assembly. Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to test the case, as when I observed it closely out of the box, I noticed that one side had a slight &#34;bowing&#34; (see attached photo), thereby not making a true seal when the two halves were snapped together around my iPhone 6. In addition, the tactile feel of the plastic was a bit too smooth, and overall, didn't exude the Quality as I had hoped.  A noble effort that fell a bit short on Quality control."
"I've used this on a golf cart now for four different outings. It is the best holder I've found for my iPhone and I use the iPhone app while golfing so I need to be able to see it and know it is secure. The grip on the plastic windshield is exceptional. It easily detaches to apply to another golf cart if necessary. It grips the phone is such a way that you know it won't come loose. I use it both on the road, on the cart paths and on the fairways and rough. It is simple and inexpensive. You can't go wrong."
"Decent quality, didn't use it much Because i felt like a drop would of destroy My phone. Bumpers scratched up bad"
Excellent case.<br /><br />Has survived many drops with no damage to the phone at all.<br /><br />Diztronic always has great products.
"Bought mine about 18 months ago for about $90 on sale at Verizon.  Use it every day, not to power my iPhone 5S which is always charged with other chargers, but it gives one full charge to my iPad Mini.  It takes an overnight charge to get to four ****, but then fills up the iPad Mini beautifully.  Have recharged it countless times, still is reliable and compact.  There is newer and faster technology out there now, but I've been very satisfied with this powerstation duo..."
"Very pleased and would reccomend, but dots fade somewhat over time. Many other of my bands have broken, but this one has held up. There was a slight misprint where the dots were printed on the side window area, but are barely noticeable."
Useless piece of junk why does sound come out of the watch?
This Privacy screen guard caused a significant rainbow effect when viewing the screen.  The privacy feature on this had at least a 120 degree viewing angle which is far more than in the product description.  I only kept it on my phone until a different screen protector arrived.
4 stars because it cracked while I was trying to get the air bubbles out with the included tool. Good customer service; one e-mail and a replacement was on the way to me. Hopefully the new one will last longer.
It works great with all 4-5 inch phone but little difficult for iPhone 6+ kind of phones specially with cover
It was great to have a long plug in but it broke right near the iPad plug in after a couple weeks.
"My car has a little side window next to the windshield where I like to mount my GPS. However, the mount from Garmin does not even have an extension arm. If I mount it on the windshield, the GPS is either too far away or I need to put it above my head. I got this arm and now I can mount it on the side window again. The suction is better than my old GPS mount that kept falling off in winter time (it is very cold here in winter). This one stick well through out the seasons. The only issue is the vibration of GPS sometimes due to the long arm."
"Love the Qualcomm technology.  The ONLY reason I'm knocking it one star is because it doesn't clearly state that it doesn't come with a cable (or, I'm just that dumb and did't see it) but it is great to have the ability to quick-charge my phone in house and now in car.  I'm using an old Motorola cable and it has no issues.  My Samsung Galaxy Note 4 charges in less than an hour.  So handy if you are on your phone a lot."
it broke already on the first day. good thing it was free :)
Easy to apply. No air bubbles at all.  Edges not quite covered but still should give great protection
"Wow.  Just wow.  I put PigflyTech's Google Cardboard together as soon as it was delivered.  (Advice: follow the instructions on the Cardboard itself, the included instruction sheet is a little convoluted.)<br /><br />After ordering this I went ahead and dowbloaded a number of Cardboard VR apps from Google Play for my Samsung S5. Wanted to be abke to just start using it right away.<br /><br />The QR code on the Cardboard comes up as  unrecognized by the official Google Carboard app when setting up the app.  That is fine, jt just sets this up as the default viewer.  The app that thw Android QR reader brings up looks like the official app but in an Eastern language.  Still, can use the offical and so many others.<br /><br />This is a lot of fun, PigflyTech.  Basic VR done right.  Love the actual cardboard construction and the metal ring on the left side that works as a switch/button in conjunction with the magnet on the inside.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Please include a head strap with this, that almost made me give Cardboard four stars instead of five.  This is great stuff, it would be fantastic if I didnt have to hold it with my hands to use it.<br /><br />This feeds the geekgirl in me.  Having a great time with it in the Insidious 3 and Virtual Tour apps.<br /><br />Came back and upped it to a 5 star rating. The lack of a head strap just isnt  enough to lose one star.  Still having fun with this!"
"Very nice case , good quality , Looks exactly like the picture , and fits my galaxy s6 edge plus perfectly 😍"
Works as described. I use it around the house and not actually while travel. My battery pack that plugs directly in the wall and has built-in cable is better suited for travel.
Makes a ringing noise when I talk to someone. But it's good all together
"I've had this iPhone cover for about a month and a half now.  Love it!  Love the scripture, the colors, the design!"
I didn't get a Bluetooth remote to take a picture with my selfie stick. So now I just have a selfie stick but no way to take the picture.
Do not buy this. The charger does not stay in the jack and the swivel arm falls down constantly. This is a horrible product.
A must have! Worth the money. Great power reserve.
My phone case is perfect and arrived on time. GREAT product.
Works great!  I'm using it with an iPhone 6 and Nexus 6 along with Nokia HERE and Gaia maps.
I bought it for my teen daughter. It fit great and has survived many drops on many different surfaces!
I would give this zero stars... it broke super fast...not happy with this product.
"CONS:<br />The reason I love HTC is for the camera.  This cover does not protect the camera, and camera started getting scratched in my purse in the odd times I used the Dot View.  I love SPECK cases and the quality of this cover is nothing like SPECK"
"Great case, very durable and covers the entire phone. A little difficult to take off but putting it on is significantly easier. Would definitely recommend!"
This phone is a piece of s***. It freezes often making it unusable. I used mine for about a few days now and I was so mad that I threw it against the wall.
The Airave Version 2 Sprint Access Point was the correct item to solve the weak signal I was receiving on my Virgin mobile phone.  The item<br />was delivered on time worked perfectly.
This phone case keeps my phone safe from any scratches while inside my purse SUPER easy to use and super cute. The magnet holds nice and tight. AND it holds my ID and Debit card.<br /><br />I received this product mentioned above for free.<br />This is my honest opinion and I hope it helps in you decision weather or not to purchase the above item..
"Great quality,love the color combo and appears to be very sturdy .<br />Most importantly , fits my Zik perfectly ."
"Wish I was able to use the volume and lock screen button. It def seems to be waterproof, but I'm not comfortable enough to submerge it in water."
Awesome.  My daughter used it on her cross-country road trip and it both performed great and was very useful.
"I use on my iPhone6, and it fits just fine. I use the air mount, which I like because it's easy to remove whenever I'm not using it."
"good Bluetooth connection distance.<br />NFC is not very useful. It works when first connect to a device, but it remembers the device, and next time power on, it first connects to that device and I cannot use NFC to make new connection. Since its Bluetooth range is good, it always connect to that device first.<br />I would prefer it always to connect to NFC request, this way is closer to audio cable."
Bought it for my 150cc Rowdy Scooter. Very loud and good sound .  Going to get it for my Harley bike in chrome.  The only daw back is the &#34;L&#34; shape mounting brackets. I had to engineer mounting brackets that would fit my scooter. The brackets were not clearly displayed on the picture used for ordering
Love this case!  Makes it so easy to keep my DL and debit card with me at all times without having to carry a purse everywhere. And it is made strong and durable. Would recommend it to anyone!
Works great looks good love eliminating blue light while charging love the Extra length of the court as well overall satisfaction this is a great product!
fast shipping and good quality
"these were actually really nice the first week. then one of the rubber pieces fell out rendering the ear bud to hang lifeless because there is nothing holding it to the headset. then one of the speakers was always kinda weak but just stopped working after a few days. for the $25 i spent, I expected a little better product considering they are marketing it as older bluetooth. not used. i'm sadder now because now the other speaker is going out and these aren't a month old yet. ugh"
"The battery came scratched and a little dented, so I didn't chance it being a defective battery. I sent it back. My battery doesn't have XXXXXXXX on it so I assumed this was not the exact same as my stock battery."
Absolutely awesome product for middle and high school kids....got two of my grandkids two sets each.. ..they love them and me for getting them!
"These adapters are great! I tried a different set of adapters also and those don't compare to these. These are better quality and a lot easier to install and swap between bands. They make the bands look integrated and apart of the watch as normal watches do. In my opinion these are the best. Note that if you are purchasing the set for a 42mm watch the largest band size to fit is 24mm, and for 38mm watches the largest is 20mm. The design if these make it easy to use with absolutely any band because of the pin size and you are able to use different pins. Other adapters force you to use their set and the connector may be too wide on others.<br /><br />I would recommend"
"Very easy make your phone stand,good design! The sound quaility is also good!!"
"When it comes to Android smartphones Samsung is dominant and it’s easy to see why. The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge have the quality engineering and craftsmanship to go head-to-head with the iPhone 6. Samsung has gone to great lengths to pay attention to detail and provide an exceptional smartphone experience.<br /><br />The Galaxy S6 Edge is cool, but the things that make it unique just don’t impress me that much. I’d recommend just going with the regular Galaxy S6 if you’re in the market for a new Android smartphone.<br /><br />Read the full review on TechSpective.net: http://techspective.net/2015/08/30/review-samsung-galaxy-s6-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone/"
"This is a really well made little device!  I got this specifically to use to hold my iphone6 plus while filming video so I've tested it on several surfaces so far and the suction is fantastic and holds really well - much better than the tri-pod I had been using which was designed for camera use.<br />As you know, the iPhone6 Plus is a heavy phone so many of the holders just can't keep the phone upright but this Osomount 360 Grip is REALLY sturdy and doesn't tip over!<br />While this is sold as a car mount,  there are MANY more applications of use possible with this such as :<br /><br />+++Attaching to a lap stand for watching movies on your phone<br />+++Sticking to a kitchen counter top to hold your phone to read recipes while you cook and<br />+++As a holder on the desktop for use with an external, bluetooth keyboard<br /><br />Those are just SOME of the uses I've discovered for this so far!<br />I was offered a promotional discount on this holder so I could try it and give my opinion  and feedback and I'm really glad I bought this!<br />It's turned out to be one of the most helpful devices I purchased in a long time!<br />Hope this was helpful info for you :)<br />Enjoy!"
This is a nice case. I don't know if its drop safe but all together its nice and slim like i like it
Product came with a toxic smell .I tried  washing it but the smell would not come out had to be thrown away
"Very,very,happy,a love,this wallet for my z30 blackberry."
"Easy to use, great for the gym and work. I received this product for an honest review. Charges easily and ready to go."
The pricing on this cord was so much better than any place else.  And I can count on the AmazonBasics quality.
"Does not fit the phone well, had to order another case, waste of money. It is hard to turn volume up or down, or shut ringer off"
The stand works as advertised. though be sure to make sure that when you wrap the cable around the tower part that it's extremely taught.
"Good tracker. Like the steps, the sleep, and the tips. Not impressed with the food tracker, not easy to use. Had weight watchers tracker, hoped to use this instead.  So far it's been disappointing in that aspect."
"Terrible. I am writing this review from an iPhone 4, since the video to do the replacement on my iPhone 6 was so vague. Don't attempt to do this yourself. Spend the extra money to have it done by someone who knows what they are doing."
Purchased for co-worker.  They were very pleased with case.
It fits ok. But the only problem is that it has some sharp edges when it's on and its lifting up my screen cover. I don't know if in gonna use it.
Pro: super cute .<br />Con: cheap & rhinestones easily fall out .
"Fits great and is a moderate protection for the phone, it came with a screen protector but I was accidentally sent a screen protector for an iPhone 4 not for the 6."
"Second Spigen cover I've used on my phones and I must say I'm impressed by how sleek and durable these cases can be! This cover in particular is even slimmer than the previous case I had on my Galaxy S5, but it feels just as sturdy. The included stand is a nice feature, looks a tiny bit flimsy so I don't think I'll be messing around with it much. Overall great product and excellent service from Spigen"
I really like this product. Holds my phone nicely. I like the swivel feature.
"This armband was way too big to fit my upper arm. I can't adjust the velcro small enough. I did manage to fit my phone in it, though it was a very tight fit. (I have a Motorola Photon Q with a case)."
Although the back was a bit scratched it is still a very good case. It allows me to wirelessly charge which is very important.  I tested it on three different wireless chargers: 1 ring & two 3 rings.  The single ring had no problems charging the phone.
"This has got to be the best portable power bank I have owned! I have owned a few of the &#34;lipstick&#34; style chargers/power banks, and all of the other power banks that I have owned don't hail in comparison to this one. It is much bigger and heavier (almost 9oz) than the other ones I had in the past, but it is still very portable. It feels like a cell phone when carrying it. This thing charges so fast and it charges very well also! I didn't receive the annoying &#34;slow charging&#34; message when I charged my Galaxy Note 3 like I did with my other power banks and chargers. I love that it stays cool with charging. There is also an LED indicator that tells you how much charge is left in the pack, but to see the indicator, you have to press the power button. It doesn't stay on. That's not a big deal for me. When I turn it on, I can know how much charge % is in the in the powerbank, so I don't need to see it the whole time the device is charging. I love that this charges anything USB! I was able to charge my phone, iPod, Bluetooth headphones, and camera with no issues. This is so convenient to have when on trips and wall outlets aren't always easily accessible. I can make sure I always have power on long car rides, when I am out and about sight-seeing, or when I can't find my product chargers. It does take a while to charge the actual power bank, but in all honesty, what would you expect from a charger with this capacity? I've needed a new one, so the opportunity presented its self to get one at a discount in exchange for a review. I couldn't pass it up! It truly is an amazing charger!"
"Great case! Especially for the price! Compared to the phone cases at the Verizon store, I saved at least 50%"
made the installation so much easier by making the connections on the bench and then just plugging in in the dash.
"Good product so far, bought two...we had two Newtrent products & both quit charging up, so without a charged battery to charge, they were useless & had to be replaced.  Went with a different brand because the reviews were good, the price was excellent & Anker was in the top 5."
"As other have said, really amazing quality and almost unbelievable that it costs so little. The arm and table clip are very sturdy and would hold up the heaviest phone completely extended. Suction cup is very strong, too. I have it mounted to a piece of smooth plastic taped to my desk. The device clip opens to a generous size and holds a Samsung S4 comfortably, could probably fit a bigger phone but definitely not a tablet."
Very bulky case. Adds a good inch to the depth.<br /><br />Shipped fast and arrived quickly though.
"For the money its as good as I could expect. When I first started playing music I was using the volume button on my phone, I was disappointed with the volume with my phone set on high. Then I held the + button on the remote and wow! it is more than the speakers can handle!! After raising the volume on the remote I leave my phone volume set to about 3/4 and that is a blast."
"This is a good case that seems to have great protection so far. I thought I would be bored with the simple blue, but it's a sleek design and how often do you look at the back anyway? Decent price in the world of phone cases, the lack of some kind of &#34;kickstand&#34; is the only critique I have. You would think everyone would have that standard by now."
"Exactly as described, at a great price."
I loved this case when I got it but it stopped taking a charge after 2 months of using it. I emailed the company to let them know in hopes that they would replace it and nobody ever got back to me.
"First off Not 3 way,its 2 way but i knew that after i read all the reviews before i purchased these so im not complaining at all....Shipped really fast, hooked up and fit perfect in my 93 chevy blazer, and it sounds really good!"
I love this case. It is a very light case but protects the borders of the phone. Very happy here
"Very good case. Protects phone well. Easy to assemble and take apart. Only thing is water gets trapped easily (sweat, a droplet, etc) and then you can't use touch. You HAVE to take it apart and get the water out."
"Pretty good quality for the price.  The screen protector was impossible to not have bubbles in, but that could just be me."
was good untill it broke but i was rough with is so it was a miracle it lasted as long as it did
Charges fast. Excellent price. Works great
Instructions suck. Why don't you give a brake down of the screen anatomy. I took mine apart according to your instruction and there is another layer your guitar wire was a bad choice as the physical characteristics tend to gravitate to the wrong layer and Your instruction says to start at the top near the microphone with knife graduating to guitar wire. When that is where the digitizer harness is. Very dangerous. Are you guys affiliated with cell phone scrap and recycle?
"Got the tempered glass, and it is THE BEST!  Goes on so easily using the hinge method, with zero bubbles, and feels like the OEM glass.  As cheap as glass screen protectors have become, there is absolutely NO reason to get any kind of plastic anymore.  Even the best of those are far inferior to tempered glass."
"Awesome,love it, delivery at my apartment do so fast. Didn't had to pay all that money at Verizon store.  Thank you so much ;)"
"I wouldn't but it again, is nothing like the picture show, cheap material, I was disappointed"
Absolutely Ridiculous!!! I wish I had paid attention to the reviews before I got this &#34;case&#34;. I don't know what it is for but it is NOT for the samsung note 4!!!!!! Learn from my mistake and don't waste your time or money!!
"This phone did not meet my expectation, i was greatly disappointed."
"Glad I got two of them, ask wife to put on phone,  I think she did not clean screen in one corner, so I took the other one to store I shop at  for them to put on. Saved money they put on for Free. Also no scratches yet!  the plastic ones scratch too easy."
"Worked ok for a month battery life was only two hours, and then the week after the Amazon 30 day return expired they would not charge or turn on.  Don't buy. I had seen some reviews that they were junk but the overall review were positive so I bought a pair and had the same problem all the one star reviews said I would."
Lost one of my original tips on the way to the gym a few days ago.  These are exactly like the originals that came with my headphones and fit great.
Love this case! I love the shape it gives my phone. With the Droid Turbo being so big it makes it easy to hold.
"The case itself is rather cute and it covers all four sides with none of the corners peeking out like some cases have. The bumpers are a bit thicker than my previous one as well, but it could definitely have a bit more padding around the edges. I do have an issue with the case though, the rubber part doesn't fit as snugly as I hoped it would at the top and bottom. I found it to be weird and it does raises some concern. Thankfully, the plastic fits around the cell and rubber case snugly."
Easy to put on and protects the phone well. My son totally loves it. So great for the pre-paid phoen we got - the cases were not available in the store and this is exactly what he wanted. Perfect!
"Space gray is perfect for the gunmetal gray M9. Easy to install, use of power and volume buttons not affected. Have installed for about a month, almost no small particles have gotten under the sides or through camera cutout."
"A good to have peripheral for emergency charging. Love the cable which came with it although a bit short. One con is that it is not very portable to carry on road (you cannot carry it in the pocket). However, at this price I'd take that any day."
"This case fits my iPhone 6 Plus very well. It is perfect lengthwise, but it's just slightly too wide. I have a slim silicon case on my phone, and it moves around a little in this case, so it's not a super-tight fit. The magnetic flap closes well and doesn't flap around when walking. The material is soft and comfortable to wear. Plus, the metal clip is long enough to fit securely over my wide belt. Very pleased. The case is made of good quality leather with a leather belt loop on the back and dual leather lined belt clips on either side of the belt loop, so you can either slide it securely over your belt or just clip it onto your belt for ease of removal without undoing your belt. I love the feel of the soft leather flap that secures the iPhone soundly with a magnetic closure. It accommodates my iPhone 6 Plus with the Hybrid Bumper case on it with room to spare. So it would accommodate an iPhone 6 Plus with a larger heavier case on it if you had one. All in all, it is one of the classiest phone holsters that I have owned. As a blogger I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies, just as in this case in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
"This case was purchased for a friend. It was purchased at the end of July and was completely useless by August 12th, because it had a short in it. She wanted to use it on a trip so ended up buying another one, and returning the bad one. The second one has worked much better. I rated it 3 stars because of the problem with the first one."
"Love these cases. Had them for my s3, s5, and now iPhone 6. Very good price for a high quality case that's easy to grip and keeps my phone safe."
Bought the case and it was exactly what I was looking for. I'm very happy with the case and it was quickly received.
"Fast arrival!  Also, made of very good quality, strong, and beneficial."
This wireless charger works great. Very happy with the charge speed and reliability.  Works better than the Samsung wireless charger that I was using prior.
The case fit very well and was very nice. I had to return it because the case would not let it charge on the charging pad though. Very nice product otherwise.
Great Speaker for the money for sure.  Good Quality and sound. It's not as loud as my Braven but it didn't cost $100 either.
"My husband loves these shoes. I first purchased the orange/black ones and he liked them so much I got him the blue ones too. The blue color is super sharp, very vibrant and he gets compliments on them often. They fit true to size, he wears 10.5 in Adidas and an 11 in Nike. He says they are super light and feel like he's not even wearing shoes. I will likely buy him another pair of the blue ones to have for the future."
"This is a really simple case and was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I swapped out my Work BlackBerry for an iPhone 5c and I swear the iPhone is made of Teflon. I needed something to counter the extreme slickness and this Caseology case does the trick while not greatly increasing they size of the phone.<br /><br />If the iPhone esthetics are critically important to you, you can still see the original phone through the clear backing. It manages to be &#34;gripable&#34; without pulling everything in your pocket out with it like some cases I have seen. The corner bumpers look like they will provide enough protection for modest drops and all of the switches are still easily usable.<br /><br />A great value."
"The ubiquitous mobile phones have become an indispensable tool of modern living. They are expensive and fragile, and therefore they need to be protected from the vagaries of the environment and accidental impacts. This has led to the development of a variety of protective cases, of different brands, price and quality. The most expensive are not necessarily the best.<br /><br />The iSelector Waterproof case is one of the best overall such cases on the market today. It is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is sturdy, made of TPU, molded hard PC plastic and Tempered Glass Screen Protector that  works flawlessly with iPhone 6's Touch ID. The case weighs 2.51 oz/ 11.5 grams and is 0.5&#34;/13mm thick. The granular surface is slip-proof and the reinforced corrugated corners absorb most impacts. All ports, buttons and controls align perfectly and are accessible. Package contains the case, a tiny flathead screwdriver, a lanyard and user manual. Set up is easy and intuitive.<br /><br />I tested the case by placing tissue paper inside it then buried it in dirt, tried to scratch it with finger nails, dropped it from a third floor balcony on concrete and finally, fully immersed it overnight in a sink full of water. The results confirmed that the iSelector case is indeed waterproof, weatherproof, dust/dirt proof and shock proof - no scratch, no leaks, no cracks, no dirt - nothing, nada!<br />Headphone port only fits the original Apple jack and does not require an extension (contrary to most cases on the market).<br />With the phone inside the case, sound quality is excellent. No damping or muffling.<br /><br />I took my iPhone 6 (inside the case) with me on a boat ride this week-end and, for the first time, did not need to put it in a cumbersome plastic locking &#34;waterproof &#34; through which one cannot dial, answer a call or take a picture - all of which I was able to do easily with the iSelector Waterproof case.<br />I really like it and shall keep my phone well protected inside this case.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review.

"This watch band is absolutely beautiful!  However, it was too small for my wrist, and I have a (what I believe to be ) normal 7.5-inch wrist.  I had to have the band buckled on the last adjustment hole making the band as large as possible, but then there wasn't a lot of band left to go into the loops and didn't feel very secure.  (For reference, I have a M/L Apple watch band and secure it on the 2nd tightest hole.)  If you have a very small wrist, this will be perfect for you!"
I was expecting the same connector as was provided with the phone.  It instead had a standard micro USB connector rather than the USB 3.
This is a great portable charger.  I do wish it was flat instead of square but it is worth the price
"Great product. Wall/car charger, cable and pouch.  Looks slick but you have to remove the cover if your going to use the wall charger and that can get lost."
This is the best android phone shield I had bought. It is made well. Installation is simple and easy. Make sure to follow the instruction. With a little skill I was able to install it perfectly.
"My Mpow Bluetooth does not work after 4 weeks.  After recharge, the Mpow button keeps blinking red and there is no sound.  I would like to replace or repair it.  Pls contact me for what to do next.  Thank you."
"The case is exactly as described and show! The color is so cute and the back is clear enough. The lettering on the back of my phone is readable. I would recommend to anyone. It protects well, but is hard to get off."
"Love the case...the holster is another thing. Protects better than a Life Proof besides the waterproof part. (Bought a LifeProof took it out of the package and immediately returned it. Felt like a $3 case, what a joke.) Popped out the cheap screen protector and put a tempered glass one on my phone. Had a scary drop from about 5.5ft on the corner of the case. Bounced a few times and never missed a beat, not a scratch on the phone. Great case feels like it can take a beating and still protect your phone.<br /><br />The holster is cheaply made and broke after a month of regular use. The plastic tab you use to take your phone in and out snapped off. Very disappointed in that portion of the product. The holster is the main reason I bought the case. SupCase needs to redesign the case. If the holster didn't break it would've been a 5 star for sure."
"It didn't work and I had to send it back. I was going to have to take my case off every night in order for the phone to charge because it wouldn't work through the case I had on my phone. It shouldn't matter what case I have, it should be strong enough to charge."
"I do like this case, but something I noticed was that the back of the case is really hard and made of a strange feeling material. The rubber inside is also not as malleable or flexible as I would expect it to be, but it did fit my phone well. I'm just not sure of how well it would protect my phone damage if I were to drop it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"
"i expected thick rubber that protected the pone and had a great feel. This feels slippery in hand. the colour looks great for me, but disappointed wit finish and feel."
"What do I like about this product: • It is compact and light • It can be paired easily with my smartphone • It has crystal clear sound • The buttons are located on the blue tooth headsets which takes a little time to get used to but once I knew how to use them, it is very easy • It can go 4-5 hours without charging. USB cable to charge is included with this product. • After using it for some time, I forgot that I had the headset in my ears.  Additional Information: It comes with Bluetooth headset, USB charger, USB earphones (for the other ear) and ear hook.  Overall opinion: Very good  Sample received from seller in exchange of honest and unbiased review."
"If i'd reviewed this within say a month of buying it, I would have had good things to say. It feels and looks nice and the little door to store cards works fairly well. But after three months, I just bought a different case and wouldn't recommend this one. First, it got very dirty looking quickly, and I couldn't get the marks off of it. Some kind of clear coating began to rub off the corners from being in my pocket, causing additional discoloration.<br /><br />The door/card storage honestly isn't great. I always had trouble prying out the card on the bottom (often to the point of having to remove the entire case). I wanted it to keep my metro card handy, which obviously means opening it two times a day minimum, plus whenever I used my credit card. Long story short, the door started to wear out after about six weeks and finally broke off completely after three months of normal use."
"This screen is incredible!  I was so hesitant to apply the screen myself, thinking I would mess it up, but the company emailed me a convenient, step-by-step set of specific directions that were simple and easy to follow.  I had my laptop open, with the instructions on the screen, and in five minutes the new screen protector was on perfectly!  Great quality, great customer service!"
"I love this case.  At first, it seemed to block the power button on the right side, but the phone and I are new to each other, so maybe I was just doing something wrong.  I have had the case a month now and I put this phone through hell.  The case is PERFECT.  I'm so happy with this purchase.  I only wish there was a way to attach the stylus."
I've had this case a little over a month and the most important part of the phone case broke off. I noticed it while I was trying to get my card out. One of the notches that keeps the flap closed is broken.. Very disappointed I loved everything about this case until that happened. Also sad that the case gets &#34;stained&#34; by jeans...
What can one say but WOW- Got his a few days ago and it works great. Charges the iPad / iPhone fast. It does get hot even when charging the iPad alone. But WOW it does it perfectly.
So far no problems but has some features that are not that easy to understand since I am not that cell phone smart. I hope I can figure out the issues that I am having.
"Great case!  It's slick looking, easy to put on, has padding on corners, and little tiny &#34;feet&#34; on back to keep it from sliding off slippery surfaces.  Kind of wish it came in other colors than it did (and there were several to choose from), but I just didn't care for those shades.  But I definitely liked the silver.  Sold and happy!"
"It rocks! Honestly if you need to keep your cellphone running all day because you work all day and you use your smartphone so much, dont think twice about it. Get Anker! It holds a lot of power and the price is more than fair ! Charges phone super fast !"
I accidentally dropped my ipod touch and now it is shattered not to mention my ipod slips ou of the pocket that is supposed to hold it tight. It is also extremely bulky and should not even be called a case. This leather pouch is terribly fit and was an extreme let down DO NOT get it.
"I LOVED THEM! Yes, LOVED, I lost them at school a couple of days ago, it hurt so much I actually had a dream where I found them. They looked nice, and had a great sound for the price, definitely recommend them, it's a shame I lost them, excellent quality for its price."
"Works well. Same as previous, Battery is difficult or impossible to replace."
"Verizon tower is about 15 miles away from our new acreage home, with complete radiant barriers in roof and walls.  .  One or two bars or -105db.  After installation, 4 to 5 bars.as low as -74 db, at least -88db.  I left transmitting antenna in attic or it would probably be even better, because I couldn't bring myself to drill holes in my new walls.  Glad I got the directional outdoor antenna.  Easy to install."
This was exactly what I needed to mount my cell phone holder to the dash.  They arrived on time and met my expectations.
I hate the Zagg invisibles girls HDX - HD! It's rubbery surface collects every piece of dust that is in the air and it is very hard to clean. It is also hard to drag your finger across smoothly. What I did like was Zagg's eagerness to have a satisfied customer and and to offer me a solution to the problem.
This phone was a disaster.  It would not go into 4G mode when 4G was available.  After searching the web I learned that there was an un-fixable bug with the RAZRs and 4G.  I lived with it for two weeks and then the speaker stopped working on the phone.  At that point I returned it.
"I use this as an auxiliary battery for my iPhone when I'm running Road Bike Pro, which between GPS and Blue Tooth sensors (heart rate, speed, and cadence) can run down the phone's built-in battery pretty quickly.  This extends my usable ride time by hours.  I love the %charged readout!"
"I have to say this is one of my favorite cases! Ive seen alot with the glitter but none with the rhinestones. It fit pefects. Looks amazing. I love the little bow on it! Great touch!! Its very durable. Ive had no problems. I have dropped my phone with this case on it, and it didnt crack the case or my phone. It doesnt leak. Its all around an amazing, beautiful case!! I was given this product for a discount for an honest review! You will not be disappointed if you buy this case!!"
A great 2 in 1 cable this is one of the best I had. I love that I can use it for 2 charging electronics. Comes in a nice box for protection. It is attached good. The plastic cable feels great quality and I know it won't break easy.  I really like that it is reinforced on the ends of the cables where the plastic tends to break easy. Cable is soft but great quality. It is easy to interchange the head attachments. I have used it in my iPhone 6 plus and on my iPad and it works perfectly.  It also works to charge other items. I can also sync with no problem or issues popping up. Really good cable. Worth it various product uses. I recommend it. Great plastic quality.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest option.
"Great product, delivered early. Easy to install and bubble free as stated. Crystal clear like there isn't a protector at all."
"Fabulous!  Such an easy, inexpensive fix for my expensive Bose docking station, which has been sitting in my closet for several years since it ceased to pair with my iphone."
screen and sound quality on the 5 inch truck car gps 560 is not so good it does not compare to the Tom Tom or the Garmin Nuvi.  Xgody should have preformed these tests so there GPS can compare to them.
Don't waste your money! It was supposed to come with 2 tempered glass covers and only came with one! The best part was the one it came with was waaaay too small and not cut for the 42mm Apple Watch. It didn't cover a large portion of the watch face. I hate when people sell stuff under a description that isn't true! This is one of those those items on AMAZON. Don't waste your hard earned money even its only a few bucks. This was a total waste of a few bucks!
"The kit looks nice in the car. Although the instructions are pretty bad. And the piece that is supposed to replace the lcd screen doesn't fit at all. Took me a long time to figure out that two of the brackets that came with the kit actually are used to put the lcd screen back in (note the instructions say nothing about it). After I figured it all out I was a very happy guy. Before I figured it out, very aggravated. Overall good product"
"Great sound , about 3 hr battery life before needing recharge"
I bought 2 over 3 years ago and they are still stuck in the same place.  Never came loose or off.
I totally agree with the previous 1 star reviews. This battery will not hold a charge for even a day. I switched back to my nearly year old OE battery cause this on lasts only about 6 - 7 hours on standby.  Junk.
"I have used this unit and I like its telephoto/magnifying feature.  Although GPS would be nice, the night vision feature has proven useful.  With many products to choose from, this one is decent for the price."
Well the box is well built. Worth the 60.00 just for the box. Didn't last too long. Pyle of crap... But box is worth the cost. Put a Kicker CompR and sounds great!
"It has an amazing battery life, I can use it while I charge it, and as long as I leave my phone's bluetooth on, I just turn it on and it automatically connects."
Omg! Where has this been all my life?!?!?! Totally in love!!! Gym time just got more exciting!!
The first transmitter I received worked for about a month. A replacement transmitter was sent out right away and works perfectly.
"I had a previous version of this radar detector and loved it. The only issue was that there were many times that it would receive a radar signal from a car passing by with collision avoidance system. This product has an updated system with a lesser amount of nuisance alerts and 90% of the time, there is actually a cop detecting radar when the alert sounds."
Battery did not work. Purchased another from another retailer and worked just fine. Thanks
Bought several cases at once and really liked this at of all. It is not bulky at all and I've dropped my phone about 10 Xs already and it is fine though it always scares me because it isn't a bulky protector type case but it has worked like one so far. Hopefully I don't drop now and it breaks since I have a great review. 😉
I do not recommend this aux cord. This is my second time buying one that retracts and both have had static and make weird noises.
Great armband. Just know if you are a small girl with tiny arms it may not fit you. My barely stays snug on my arm.
"Seriously, if you don't have this on your $600+ phone you're making a mistake.<br />I slapped on of these on my mom's phone and forgot all about it.<br /><br />She freaked out after dropping her and cracking the screen<br />and I reminded her about the temper glass screen protector.<br />I peeled off the cracked screen protector and behold! The iPhone screen was without a scratch!<br /><br />Spend the $5 and just get it!"
"Buyer beware. I loved these AT FIRST.  Slowly after a couple of months, the pairing became more difficult.  I'd have to forget the headphones and restart/reboot my iPods and iPhone every time.  This becomes frustrating.  It's shortened my workouts because sometimes it takes 15 minutes.  Today, it's been almost 30 minutes.  I threw them away in frustration.  Sadly, I bought my niece a pair right before all the problems.  I hope she's one of the lucky ones.  Is it worth $20 for something that might only work 3-4 months? Your call."
"This LCD protector looks very cool on my phone, i will recommend it if you want your phone's face to look like a mirror"
case fit perfectly.
very superior Case 5 Stars
Does what its supposed to. Fitment could be better... but it is pretty inexpensive.
"Nice, light weight, convenient, gives an extra charge to my iphone (note that you will need an adapter to be able tu use it with an iphone as this comes with a micro USB plug)."
"It's perfect,best screen saver I ever purchased"
"Works well, synced fine and I'm not tech savvy. The band is comfortable. It seems to be more secure than my polar F4 that I bought about a year ago. I did use it a lot though so it just kind of wore out a little. Update: 8/30/15 I tried to swim in my endless pool today and it didn't work so well. It didn't keep my heart rate like my polar does. I'm going to try to tighten it next time or see if I can use it with my Polar strap and see how that works. I like to do high-intensity interval training so if this doesn't work with my polar strap and this is getting sent back. I simply have to see my heart rate while I'm swimming. I took away a star for this."
I like this case a lot. It fits well and protects the phone. My only complaint is that I dropped my phone and the case easily dented. My phone was ok but the case has some damage but still functions.
Love the arm band. The material is soft. It is very comfortable on the arm. Fits like a glove on my phone.
Good convenient size for a briefcase. Wish the lighting end was a bit smaller so it wouldn't interfere with my case.
"This is a great item.  I use my phone as a scanner.  It usually goes down very quickly.  I can attach this and it charges the phone back up.  It is remarkable for such a small, inexpensive item."
Unu's super pack was given to me for review purposes and I believe they make some of the best products especially for the iPhone and iPad. This little external charger is great for anyone on the go and doesn't have access to an outlet to plug in the phone. Right after receiving the super pack I noticed that my phone battery was low. Down to 20% so I plugged it in because it came charged up and ready for use. I was able to get 1 full charge within less than 30mins. This thing charges your device quickly and is smart enough to know when your phone is fully charged and stop charging.  I love the fact there is a push button switch to turn it on and off and led lights to show you how much battery is left in the charger. I will be bringing this external 5000mah battery pack with me everywhere I go just because of it shear size.<br /><br />UNU has always made great products and this one doesn't fall short. It is one of the best external chargers I have use. Better than morphie or any other knock off brand. I will be recommending this to anyone who is always on the go because it's small enough to place in your pocket.
"I received the phone quickly. It was in passable shape but after one day the screen turned yellow. Upon further inspection, there is a small crack on the inside portion of the top right screen. We have tried to reboot the phone to no avail."
"I've tried many different bands and have had an allergic reaction to the metal on most of them, even Apple's $50 sport band.  And other leather bands aren't genuin leather because they crack as soon as you bend them.  This band is amazing!  No rash from the metal clasp and no cracks in the strap at all.  I bought the red and was so happy I went back to buy the black.  Only wish they offered more colors."
An excellent auxiliary cord that doesn't crackle when moved around. Very pleased with this purchase. Extremely pleased with the price considering I paid about $15 at a retailer for another cord in my wife's car. Highly recommend this product
Case was cracked when it arrived and pieces have been falling off it already ordered another case from otter box
"If your phone supports fast charging thanks to the Qualcomm 2 chipset, you needed this yesterday. It charges amazingly fast. My HTC One M8 will go from near death to 100% in about 20 minutes, which is incredible to me. Got one for the car also and it also charges super fast. I would dock it a star for being such a plug hog in the wall, but it's the right height, and displaces it's size in width, leaving room for another plug."
"Cheap, light, adequate player. Bluetooth functionality for external speaker link only, Not for file transfers. 8gb built in memory, micro SD slot to expand. Can only access your files on one or the other though, not both at the same time."
"This device was the perfect solution for listening to music in my car.  My car came with a factory-installed iPod cable for listening to music through the radio, but after 4 years it no longer works. It would have been $445 to repair!  I started looking for a cheaper alternative, and this is it.  I am also happy that since my car has both a USB and auxiliary port, this little device charges itself as I drive.  I'm also happy that I can use my iPhone 6 with a Lifeproof case on it without having to worry about a headphone adaptor for the case, since I'm now using the phone's Bluetooth.  Also, I'm not sure if this applies to all phones, but I can still receive Bluetooth calls through the car's system, and it will just pause the music Bluetooth on this device.  Easy to install and easy to use!"
"Me & My wife have matching phones and matching cell phone wallet cases and we love it, works great fast speed, a lot of space on the phone to save and store data."
It looks really cute but within a day the rhinestones fell off and within a week the eges started to look frayed. I'm going to have buy another case and i've only had this one for a little while
"Got this to replace my FitBit Flex that had bit the dust for the 2nd time.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a pedometer/exercise tracker, then you may like it.  If you are looking for something that will work with other fitness apps, forget it and keep looking.  The S Health app from Samsung leaves A LOT to be desired, especially if you are accustom to My Fitness Pal or apps like that.  It doesn't even come close.  From what I've been able to find, I'm not sure it will ever work with My Fitness Pal.<br /><br />For my money, another FitBit would have been a better investment."
For the money you won't find a better case for your phone.
"The case on amazon was the best price I could find and it came really quickly.  It came all intact and everything as stated.  Love how sleek it is.  I bought one for my iPhone 6 plus, this one is on my husband's iPhone 6."
"Everything is right with the holder. color, adjustable, size. Like it a lot and it goes well with my bike !!"
"Fast service, the case is really nice and strong. Would purchase again from seller."
Have had one of these for 8 months and I dont even notice that its on my phone. Recently dropped my phone on its face and the screen protector cracked but the phone screen underneath is perfect. I believe it did what it was supposed to do. Will be ordering another one.
"Worked great and comfy for the price, until my iPhone 6 fell out and cracked! Since this case is made for multiple phone brands, it doesn't fit the iPhone 6 &#34;snug&#34; and has room to wiggle when not completely tight on your arm. Now I have a cracked screen. At a minimum, I would expect an armband to HOLD your phone until you manually remove it, especially if its going to be used during exercise (moving around a lot)."
"Does not work at all. Went to a water park and put all my things in there, from cell phone to money. Everything got wet. Thank goodness my phone didn't get damaged because that would have been a big problem."
"The box is amazing 2.0 charging is perfect , but the cable , not so much. After the first 2 days , so 2-4 charges in , it stopped fitting into my phone. It fits in , but falls right out , as if what should be holding it into place broke. I really want to blame my phone , mostly do , but still the durability factor of the cable isn't the best. So for the box 5/5 , cable 2/5"
I have bought several of you screen protectors and they are the best.
Works very well for a quick and easy sound system. Can worknfor any application. Have had it almost 2 months and works excellent. Several friends are buying one for there utv's & atv's.
"I have never had any lucky with these screen protectors, always bubbles, always aligned incorrectly, etc. I did not have much luck with this one either, but I chalk this up to user error. The great thing about these protectors is that it comes with THREE protectors. So if you mess up the first one, you still have 2 others to try and get it right. It also comes with a great full size microfiber cleaning cloth as well. So these are great bonus for the great price you are paying.<br /><br />It says bubble free, but when I tried to put this on the first time, I had a ton of bubbles. I have not yet tried the other two protectors yet, so I am hoping by the third try I will get it right. I also had a tiny hair that somehow found its way between the phone screen and the protector, so that drove me nuts, but again, this is all user error.<br /><br />I recommend watching the instructional video that they publish and to put apply the protector in an area that is dust and hair free, or as close as you can get to an environment like that."
"*I received this product for free solely for the purpose of testing and reviewing this product. All unbiased opinions are my own.<br /><br />With this case, I now have convenience, and great protection all in one case. The wallet comes handy to store a credit card, while keeping the case thin. The only downside is, it holds only one card, and that may be a problem for some people. It also does not hold cash, which is another downside.<br /><br />The case itself is really tough. It is only made with 2 pieces, a hard outside and a softer inside, which are stuck together and make the case extremely shockproof. Pressing the buttons require a little more work, but not an extreme amount of pressure. The only thing that irritates me is that the volume on/off switch is recessed in the case, so you have to stick your finger all the way inside to access the switch. Good luck if you have grown fingers and little nails.<br /><br />Overall, I only took off a star for all the disadvantages, but I feel that the main points have been said in helping you find your next case for your iPhone 6 Plus."
Bad case. The case kept coming out for no reason. And I  can't return it according to the seller. Waste of my money.
"It works, just not very strong, could have been made out of some harder plastic.  but like i said, it fits and works like a charm."
"I like the phone so far, the only problem is that the lock screen only works sometimes. I hate that about it because anyone who picks up my phone can access it."
"This phone case is great! I got it as a Christmas present and it has protected my phone amazingly well. I have dropped it a lot (hence my needing a high impact case) and I've dropped it on hard surfaces like concrete (even accidentally dropped it down a flight of stairs) and it has held up really well.  My only complaint is that the case cracked in the corner after about 6 months and now gapes open (but that's just as much my fault for dropping it so often). I've been lazy and haven't gotten a new case yet, but even with the break, it still protects my phone! I dropped it on my tile bathroom floor just a couple of days ago and even though the case actually flew apart my phone was still okay.  That's one bad thing that happens with this case - if it drops really hard the case will actually come open a little bit, but it's not a big deal, you just snap it back together and it's fine. I would definitely buy this case again!"
Five stars because it does exactly what it says it will do. I had to buy both this and the<br />Metra Reverse Wiring Harness 71-5600 as the previous owner of my truck was mentally ill when he wired his aftermarket deck. Great product.
they look good feel great in your ear sound quality is decent but the battery life sucks 6 months later and I'm buying a new pair of headphones and I bought two and they both went out they need to improve the batteries on them.
"After taking a few days to research the current crop of smartwatches and reading what others had to say about their smartwatch experiences I chose to give the Moto 360 a try and I'm glad I did.  None of the currently available 1st generation watches are likely to fit everyone's tastes but I found the Moto 360 to be a beautiful and functional watch and as it is currently on sale its an exceptional value.  Out of the box the watch is easy to set up and prompts you to update to the latest version of the Android OS, Lollipop.  The watch paired easily with my Alcatel Tracfone and sends timely notifications and e-mails conveniently to my wrist.  I love it!  For those that feel variety is the spice of life you will find many watch faces available in the Google Play store.  Some folks seem overly concerned with battery life on these watches.  I put my watch In the wireless charger before I go to bed at night and its ready to go in the morning.  Even with ambient mode selected and with moderate use the charge lasts me all day.  When I bought this watch I wondered if I would find it useful but after wearing it for a week I know that if I didn't have it I'd miss it.  I'm happy with the Moto 360 and would buy it again without hesitation."
Everything is there except a manual.  This installation is tricky because the button transducers hang by thin plastic.  I severed the on/off button and don't think I can recover my phone.  The screen does work as before.  Showing the phone charging.
"I don't like how it does not have a solid protective front cover like the defender series.<br /><br />It just uses a stick on front cover that you can get from any store or company.<br /><br />I love otterbox, but would like to see better frontal protection on this model."
"I have only used it for a couple weeks.  It seems to hold a charge as well as the previous battery, though it does get hot as the previous one did.  My original battery swelled to twice its original size so I purchased this as a replacement"
Magnets are the same quality as the original ones that came with my imagnet phone cradle. Great deal for such a cheap price!
I love solar power and the ability to harness some of the sun's power to use for my devices. 
2 of the 4 corners did not stick. This is a 2 pack and same thing happen with both. I still wore my watch with the screen protector on and dust got under the 2 corners and caused them to lift more and it just didn't last.
I could not use my smart phone with out one of these.  The best part is that they fit into the phone so you do not keep looking for it when you need it
Did not fit my iPhone 5 as it said. Would not purchase
Disappointed. I chose this one even though it was more expensive than some other options.<br />1. The glass was extremely thin.<br />2. It did not cover the entire watch face<br />3. It was chipped and then cracked by the following morning after applying it. I can't imagine what I bumped into that would have caused enough concern to check it.
"I was really surprised how much better the tempered glass protector felt over a plastic protector. Since applying this product to my screen, my phone did take a spill and got a hairline crack in the middle, but the phone's screen is fine. The glass is much easier to apply as well than a plastic one and you don't have to worry about dust particles (you still want a clean surface of course) like you do with the plastic. Overall, I am very happy with the product and feel it's well worth the extra cost to protect your screen."
I didnt expect much when i ordered the case due to the low cost after receiving it I am very happy with the purchase.
"I just got my RAVPower 15W charger. It works great! I live in sunny Arizona so there is plenty of strong sun here. I'm also a big fan of using solar energy as much as possible! I wanted a solar charger that I could take on my kayak camping trips out in the wilderness. I have a small tablet, flashlights, and batteries that I want to keep charged during my trips. The RAVPower 15W seemed perfect for that situation. I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I ran a test of the RAVPower 15W charging my HP Stream 7 tablet. (You can see the pictures here.) I found the following result:<br /><br />Charging Time: 45-minutes starting @ 11:15am<br />Sunlight: Full sunlight in late August at 33 Degrees North - device was laid flat<br />Device: HP Stream 7 Tablet (turned off)<br />Battery Type: 3000 mAh Li-ion polymer<br />Charge Result: 57% to 90% battery<br />Battery Change: +33% (~1000 mAh in about 45 minutes)<br /><br />Here is my take from the device so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very fast charge for tablets and cellular devices<br />Better results than expected<br />Nicely Packaged<br />Material is high-quality<br />Well-built<br />Excellent customer support website with warranty registration<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />Charger gets VERY hot in the sun (maybe they should use white material for the cloth instead of black)?<br />Make sure you cover the device you are charging to protect from sun.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with this charger. For less than $50 I have a great power source for my kayak camping trips!"
"Have had tech Armor covers for other phones and loved them.  This cover installed well, but when I put the case on it started to loosen at the bottom edges.  I've only had the cover for 2 weeks and yesterday the bottom shattered.  This was with normal use.  I had not dropped or bumped the phone.  The case is a slim Vena case, but must have caused pressure to the edges of the curvature, to cause the break.  No wonder tech Armor will not warrant this cover as they do the others.  I will buy a different brand that is not edge to edge.  The case will protect the edges anyhow, so probably don't need entire face covered anyhow."
Stopped taking a charge after 8 months. Now it's just a paper weight. Waste of money. Don't buy.
"Spent hours and hours researching slim wallet cases for my new Iphone 6 and decided on this one.  Was particularly excited because it had a gold color option.  Alas, many of the reviews were true about the sliding door being difficult to open.  I had to push on the door so hard to open it, I thought I was going to break my phone.  I even gave it a try for a 2-3 days hoping it would loosen up and it didn't.  Returned it and now I'm back to trying out a few other case options."
Protect your iPhone at all costs! Lol!! It makes the phone seem a bit bulky but worth getting. Matches the color of phone exactly.
I love this case.  This the 2nd one I have.  1st was for my note 4 and now for my note 5.
"The text feature has no instructions in the manual. You will need to download MotoSpeak  to get it to work. It will verbally read the incoming text weather you have the headset on or not. You can turn the app off if you want, which I do if I am not wearing the headset. The big disappointment to me was it will receive the text but you cannot send a text. The headset itself is pretty good. Background noise does not interfere with your call as much as others I have used."
"[[ASIN:B00Y9WQM6G Mpow Streambot Trapezoid 3.5mm In-car FM Transmitter Radio Adapter for iPhone 6 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 5G 4S 4 3GS 3G Galaxsy S6 S6 Edge S5 S4 S3 Note 4 3 2,HTC One M8 / M7 / Mini]]<br />It reproduces mono sound that seems comming from distance. I'll have to get a different product of better quality.It's not worth for most of us who are used to now of stereo sound."
"Was not cheap made and I was expecting it to be because of the price. Overall super cute, great material and worth it!"
One of the three cables already stopped working and iPhone message says that the cable is not certified... Do not buy this brand  Updating 09/10/2015 - 2 of the three cables have failed. Don't waste your time or money on these. They are obviously NOT CERTIFIED or just CERTIFIED TO FAIL!!!!!!!
Good value for the price. Protects the phone o.k. I've already dropped it and it stayed in the case. Easy to access the buttons and the charging cover. I like it.
IPhone 6 fits good  everything is working good so far but only have had it a week  armbands a little small could be a little bit bigger but it's working for me  and I'm not a very big guy
"I LOVE this screen protector. I recommend buying two of them. I drop my phone a LOT and actually I'm on my second one. The one I have on my phone now has a crack all the way through it from me dropping it but it's barely noticeable so I haven't replaced it yet. I drop my phone almost once a day and it never cracks any more and my screen is still perfect. I've never had a screen last this long. The screen protector is also totally unnoticeable when it's placed correctly. It goes on easily with no bubbles, and you literally can't feel or see that it's there once it's on. I would buy this product over and over again in lieu of a phone case."
If you want to have your iphone safe just use a screen protector! My phone has dropped many times and with the glass it everything alright..
Bought these to go with a new iPad. My grandma prefers them to her finger. Worked as she needed them to.
Arrive on time.<br />Very Happy.<br />I Put myself in my phone and everything is perfect.<br />Tks...
I would not recommend this protector to anyone who wants a protector that covers the entire screen area. There are gaps on both sides of the screen because the protector is too small. I have attached pictures showing the issue.
"I have only used this once, but it's a perfect fit for the LG Ultimate 2. It gives a perfect grip when on the phone and it looks nice too."
"Very nice portable battery with a sleek design. I take it with me almost everything I go. I have a 6 plus so this is a must + if you're a heavy user like me, you'll definitely need one. Great price and way more powerful than battery case."
"This is OK when i go running, but sometimes it feels like its not super secure on my arm. The phone is EXTREMELY secure feeling in the case, but it's not really comfortable."
"Short:<br />Charges my Note5 fairly quickly, though not as quickly as a Fast Charge charger. It's cheaper than most others and works well.<br /><br />Long:<br />Charges my Samsung Galaxy Note5 just fine and the pad is almost exactly the same size, which makes alignment quick and easy - just set the phone down and squeeze the sides / line up the bottom edge.<br /><br />Sitting with the charging pad about 3 ft from me, I can hear a quiet, steady 2 bps (beats per second) high-pitched noise - surely the electronics &#34;pinging&#34; for device discovery to begin charging. While audible, it is quiet, steady, and is a tone that doesn't cause me any annoyance.. after a while, I forget it's there, like a fan or other white noise. I probably wouldn't sleep with it on a nightstand next to my bed, but any other use shouldn't be problematic.<br /><br />It's extremely light, which isn't necessarily a good thing. I might prefer some more weight to help anchor the pad in place. The bottom has four tiny corner bumps and being made of relatively cheap materials, the pad isn't absolutely perfectly shaped, so it wobbles from corner to corner on a flat surface ever so slightly. Both of these points are minor and essentially inconsequential.<br /><br />The top isn't non-slip like some others. There's no rubber or sticky silicone on top. That said, I've had no problems and it actually turns out to be a good thing given the way I align my phone as described above. Easy sliding means I can quickly lay my phone down and squeeze the sides to align, as opposed to have to line it up correctly prior to setting it down.<br /><br />The LED is on the &#34;front side&#34; (the bottom, i.e. the side of the pad that faces you) and is bright enough to see, but small enough that it's not obnoxious. It's a steady read and turns steady green when charging. When my Note5 is fully charged, the charging pad remains in charge mode with a green LED. Not a real problem, just pointing out it's not as sophisticated as some of the other chargers available.<br /><br />It charges my Note5 about half as quickly as Samsung's provided Fast Charge wired charger, which is to say this pad actually charges quite quickly compared to what I'd expect for wireless charging. I just set my phone down now: at 65% battery, the phone estimates 60 minutes to 100%. That would be roughly just under 3 hours to go from 0% to 100% if the curve were linear. Samsung's own Fast Charge Wireless Charger claims 0% to 100% in 2 hours, so given that the TechMatte pad is &#34;normal&#34; wireless charging, 3 hours ain't bad at all."
Wife loved it a stylish but suttle replacement for the OEM option.  Ordered second one for other family member.<br /><br />Same sizes and quality as original band.
"It's a cute case, but when I received it in the mail the gold part of the phone case was not attached  to case. It's cheaply made and doesn't fit completely on one side of phone. Company reached out to me for feedback and told them same story. No one responded, not even for an apology. Needless to say I will not buying any future purchases with this company."
"Great case, my daughter loves it!"
Worked well for a few weeks. Now it doesn't hold anything. But I got use out of it for a few rides at least.<br />Perfect idea for geocaching via bike.
Bought this case for my friend and she absolutely adores it. Great contrast to her black galaxy.
"Battery life is great with this product. Doesn't take forever to charge like previous products I have had, and will last all day with HEAVY use. I can get 10-12 hours screen on time with this in a single day.<br /><br />The back the comes with this does feel a little cheap and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. It can pop off really easy if you're not careful. It does make your phone about 3/4 inch thick and significantly heavier, but it's a good balance between the smaller capacity batteries and the REALLY big ones."
"This is one of the nicest screen protectors I have ever seen. It is thin but thick enough for protection. It's not easily scratched and it fits like a snug. My sister who has a note made me give this to her. I guess she needs it as much as she drops her phone lol. When we opened the box, it was so nice and sophisticated in the box. It was well packaged and it is very sleek looking. It comes with a alcohol pad and a cleaning cloth. Everything you need to get you started. I ran my fingernail across the screen to see if anything would pick up and NADA...that was nice to me but the best thing of all, no air bubbles. I have air bubbles and there's no chance of any getting inside. I am very pleased. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review at a discounted rate. I would gladly recommend this product. Great Great Great screen protector. Great investment!!"
durable.  doesn't peel.  good protection.
best charger cables I've ever purchased. Charges phones quickly and is very durable. I will buy more of these soon.
"Nice compact charger for Apple watch. Watch cradles well and really can't fall out due to design & MAGNETIC watch charger hold watch in place. There's really not much you can say about the simple concept charger, SIMPLE &  works well."
Arrived quickly. Perfect.  No need to say more.
"Excellent case. I was a bit puzzled at first how to open it, so a little slip of paper saying &#34;push&#34; may have helped! But so far, ii has been great. Tough, good looking and strong!"
Fits perfectly. Good grip.
"Runs small ... probably great for women, but for an average sized male it will barely fit.  Also, there is no way to control volume, etc. when wearing it.  My last arm band was made out of a silicon rubber and it had preformed impressions for volume control, etc.<br /><br />This product isn't bad ... it's just not that good, either.  It provides decent weather protection."
Versityle Selfie Stick with multiple options for hieght standalone and mobility modes
Great case works like it should. Only con was that there was plastic I the way for the charger to fit. Fixed it with an exact o knife and works great
"The 1 star rating is because of the poor battery life.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, the batter will drain in 3-4 hours even without use.  If you use, it will drain even quicker.  I also have had trouble making calls--sometimes takes 3-4 tries to connect a call.  I've had several episodes where my phone just dropped the call in the middle of a conversation(can be extremely annoying).  On the plus side, for a prepaid phone it surfs the net reasonably well; it's do-able.  Overall, very disappointed."
"Let's start with the packaging - a tin, sliding case, lots of plastic, and cushioning wrap for something that doesn't break. It's not &#34;glass&#34; in the regular sense. It feels like plastic. That's not why I sent it back. Mine was cut a fraction too small, so that if one side lined up, the other side had a thin strip of screen exposed. It shows up fingerprints badly as well. I'm returning it and going back to thin, plastic film covers. I had one for my iPhone 5c and never had to use the other three sheets for almost two years."
I use it to power my GPS and it works beautifully. My old one would die after about 4 or 5 hours. This one will go for 2 or 3 days without recharging. Great product.
"Very timely delivery and exactly what I needed. The best part? The very next day after I put it on my brand new iPhone 6, I absently left it on the hood of my car and drove off. After realizing it, I drove back and another car was parked where I previously was. For the amazing part.... My phone was face-down and under the tire of an SUV!!!! The only thing that happened was the plastic screen protector I had on it was slightly cracked. That is it! I have always swore by OtterBox's and now I am both awed and a lifetime user."
Great product for getting a nice clean signal to your amp. I especially like the adjustable gain knobs.
Works great Love The belt loop. I work in crawl spaces don't loose My phone. AAA
A great cell phone for the price. It has all that I need in a cell phone.
"My cable, when connected to an iPad or iPhone it clicks endlessly at times. It requires that the label face front, otherwise it will not change. Garbage Do Not Buy!"
These are AMAZING. First off they use a micro USB as a charger so I can charge them on the way to the gym with my car charger that I use for my phone. They also charge really quickly and will last 8 hours. I even like the voice because it let's me know when they are actually totally off. LOVE THEM. GREAT VALUE!
I couldn't get this charger to put my note edge in fast charging mode until I Googled and realized you have to make sure cord snaps into charger (push hard). It was charging but not in fast charging mode until that point. Now it's perfect!
"Awesome, quick charger works just like the one that came with my phone for home charging.  Galaxy S6 Edge.  Super fast free delivery, arrived earlier than estimated time."
"I wish I had bought this sooner.  The Anker Charging Station has done an excellent job of reducing the clutter on my night stand. I currently have it charging an IPad 2, Kindle Fire, IPhone 6, IPhone 5, and an external battery.<br /><br />The included 40 watt - 5 port charger matches the charging station and does an excellent job.  This is my second Anker charger and I am very happy with the quality of these devices.<br /><br />So far I have only 2 complaints:<br />1. The slot furthest to the front is wider than the two behind it.  I wish this was reversed as it would be easier to charge the iPad in a thick case and be able to access smaller devices if it was located in the back.<br /><br />2. I wish that they offered this in black."
"I'm sure the speaker would work great if it was the one that fit my phone.  The speaker in the picture is not the same speaker that I received.  The speaker I received has a thin plastic piece sticking up about 1/2&#34; on the left side.  (outside of speaker facing you).  I did see the speaker I received in pictures from other companies.  If you need this speaker, cross your fingers and order.  I wasn't upset about the price, so I'm not going through the trouble of returning it.  I'm more aggravated that I have to wait another month for another speaker from a different company.<br />I did get this speaker about a week before expected date.  Good luck!"
Great wire I am using mine to put with my portable charger battery pack.<br />Works great no problems so far.
"I have had the adapter for 5 days...<br />Paired, played, talked, and tethered with this adapter 3 ways to Sunday.<br />Besides the bad reviews...(It breaks, muffled sound, repairing, or it just plain stops working) at this point I can say that it is worth a 3-4 star rating.  Lets be honest with each other....<br />There are only a few reasons why you are reading any of these reviews for a Bluetooth receiver.<br />1. You are too broke (like me) to buy a newer car that has Bluetooth capabilities.<br />2. You are too cheap (like me) to buy a newer car or stereo that has Bluetooth features.<br />3. You are looking to rid yourself of cords and use that fancy smartphone of yours (like me).<br /><br />I have two cars (that are paid off...did I say that I was smart and cheap?)<br />04 Honda Accord with a broken CD player (who uses those anymore huh?) no AUX, and no USB.<br />04 Toyota Carola with tape deck (who even has tapes anymore huh?) no AUX, and no USB. Been using a AUX Cassette Adapters for any phone that has an AUX."
The reason I gave this such a low review is for a major flaw that it has. The charging cable does not line up flat with the hole where the watch rests. This decreases the magnetic connection strength and ultimately causes the watch to fall off and lose its charge.
Fit my new phone perfectly! I've had it a couple of months now and it has performed exactly as described. I am 100% happy with my purchase.
"Off to a strong start.  Only had this a week with light use, but my initial impressions are positive.  For the price point seems well enough made.  I like the metal rotating belt clasp, hope it stronger than plastic clips, which can be the weak link in other holster type products.  I will update in the future if my opinion changes.  Main reason for writing a quick review is just to let people know that my Galaxy S6 with a Spigen Slim Armor case fits perfectly, maybe a touch tight, but I think the holster may stretch a bit over time and honestly even if it doesn't its not so tight that it can't be used, but takes a bit more force to pull it out, not a big deal, don't let that dissuade you from buying this case.  Between the case and holster this very expensive phone investment should be a safe as I can make it."
I've dropped my phone a few time snow and it's held up like a champ.  Now I can be clumsy and not feel guilty.
"As someone already mentioned, this case is so slim and matches the gold color of my gold Edge+ so perfectly that it's difficult to tell that it even has a case on it.  Well done!"
"Left Speaker was Buzzy at loud volume, and Buttons failed first day, Returned after less than an 2 hours use... Very Bad Build Quality on a decent design..."
Wasn't expecting much from this cheap amp but it hits pretty hard!  Right now I'm just using it to drive one 8&#34; Kicker sub and it more than does the job.  In case no one else has mentioned it here - in order for the little remote to work you have to use this amp on the low-pass setting.  Cheers.
"I bought these for my boyfriend. If he is somewhere with background noise, I can hear it. It is very annoying."
"Absolutely LOVE these.  Not only are they weight-sensitive on-off, they are great for an added boost to the height of the seat in winter to see better. LOVE 'em!"
Does not work with my radio. Gives me call numbers for the radio that the radio does not recognize. Completely useless device!
:) Great screen protectors.
Functionality is great followed by a great design. Card slots are a little tight at first so they need to be broken in. Some stitching is a little weak but doesn't cause any problems. Highly recommended
"This a restructure of Samsung Note 4 instead of a new model.<br /><br />The reason this phone got a 2-star instead of 1-star was that it had great QHD display and slightly better rear camera. However three great features were taken away from the previous model.<br /><br />1. No removable battery, which meant once your phone's battery died in two years or less, your phone became useless unless you find a technician to replace a new battery for extra $100 or more.<br /><br />2. No memory card upgrade, which meant you have to spend $100 more to upgrade from 32 GB to 64 GB. In contrast, in Note 4, you could upgrade to 64 GB for $15 with a mini memory card on Amazon.<br /><br />3. Shorter battery life, since the phone's new features used more battery than previous models.<br /><br />With these disadvantages, this phone is worth no more than $250 with no carrier contract."
Don't buy. Nonexistent customer service. Bought in July 2015 and used  3 times. Only use when at beach.  The cover for charging port fell off and small metal post that supposedly secures the cover was lost. Tried to return to Amazon but beyond their return window. Case has 1 year warranty for return but can not find manufacturer contact information despite thorough web search.
"The texture of the case is nice and firm, a good feeling. but that&#34;s it. the case gives the phone no protection what so ever.<br />My son dropped his phone getting out of the truck, into a pebble garden. A PEBBLE GARDEN, and the screen cracked.<br />If you want this case for looks then get it. but if you want protection, find something else."
I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. It is a nice case and good quality but not very protective. It basically decorates your phone. It's nice for that purpose
"it does not work well, very poor quality, product already returned."
"great case, has a manly matte black finish !"
"Great Quality Product. Case fits like a glove. Not bulky like those Fisher Price looking Otter Box Cases! If you don't work in construction or jump out planes,then this case is for you.  It's very  similar to my Spigen Neo Hybrid Case for my Samsung Note 3! Note: Spigen Cases are nice cases as well. VERUS design Lab you have just won yourself a loyal customer. Really like the attention to detail, great craftsmanship, superb work! Nice snug fit, doesn't make my phone feel bulky at all. Thank you VERUS design Labs!  👍👍 😉👊"
"no, no impact at all after I installed this filter<br />useless for my car."
"I absolutely loved it, BUT after the first time I dropped my phone the top of hard case part broke. Also The back design started pealing after two weeks. :("
"Wow, amazing guys it can't be better then this. If you have a S6 edge and looking for a screen protector plz don't waste your time just buy this. Thanks a lot for such a product"
I like this product but i think that the cable are a little thin for a dash board camera
"Everything about using these screen protectors was disappointing.  I've used several other brands in the past, and never had the problems I've had with this one.  The cloth that came with this was the lintiest (if that's a word) cloth I've ever used.  This is the only screen protector I've used where my phone always looks filthy.  And it's not just the fingerprints (each one stays forever); it just looks dirty.  I haven't had any problems with it sticking like some others have mentioned.  It just never applied well and it's useless to me because the screen looks like such a mess all the time."
"What a great idea, the Pyle PLCM7200 Backup Camera & Rearview Monitor Parking Reverse System.<br />My truck has a built in reverse camera which is dead on for hooking up the trailer.<br />The trailer has a 350 gallon water tank and is wider than the truck so backing was a hit and miss gamble on narrow<br />mountain roads.<br />I bought and installed the Pyle 7200 on the back of the trailer and tested it out in the yard, it worked perfectly.<br />Not needing to make a water run, I left it parked for several weeks. During that time it rained several times.<br />When I needed water I hooked the trailer up and was off to get water. I couldn’t see a thing behind the trailer.<br />When I examined the Pyle 7200 I found it nearly filled with water from normal rain. I removed the camera, dried it out,<br />sealed it  with gasket goop and it worked again but only until it warmed up, creating a condensation over the lens.<br />It does that every time I want to use it now. I would like to replace it with another that has never been wet, or even another<br />12 volt camera that was made to be outdoors. You would think a backup camera would be weather proofed for outdoor use.<br />THL"
Everything is alright. I like the phone and the back leather. Also nice camera
Came in super fast looks brand-new for other viewers you could come in a Ziploc baggie but it's brand-new it's awesome .<br /><br />They shipped really fast I hope they ship all the time out this fast thank you
This item got mixed reviews and I really hesitated on buying it because I was worried about what my experience would be.  I'm happy to say that I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.  I bought this for my 2013 BMW 335i xDrive and it fits perfectly behind the rear-view mirror (closer to the passenger side).  I bought a 10 foot USB Mini B cable to power it and I needed all 10 foot by the time I tucked it behind the roof/door panels.  Note that it does come with a 10 foot 12V car charger but I was already using the receptacle for something else and needed USB instead.  The instruction manual isn't great but I was able to figure out most of the functions by just playing with the buttons.  I bought a class 10 mini SD card (Sandisk Ultra) and have not had any issues.<br /><br />UPDATE: 01/27/2016 I'm now getting a &#34;Memory Error&#34; when trying to use the camera.  This worked fine for a long time so I'm a little annoyed that it is not working anymore.  I guess you get what you pay for.
Would have been great if I would have paid attention and gotten one that fit my tablet. They don't make them for the LG7 yet 😔
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Syncs perfect with your smart phone and looks like this watch costs me hundreds.  My husband is literally obsessed with his new gadget.
"WOW!  This is a spectacular high capacity portable charger.  It's an amazing 20,000 mAh and can charge your phone, ipad, kindle, computer or any other electronic device!  It has two dual charging capacities:  1 amp and 2 amp.  It can charge multiple devices without running out of juice.  I have used 8,000 mAh's before and it can charge my phone probably twice.  But I love that I can charge two devices at the same time and it is just as quick.  It does only come with one usb cord, but that's okay as I have plenty of usb cords and ac jacks.<br /><br />It is small enough to fit inside your briefcase or purse.  It is a bit heavier (almost one pound) and larger than my other chargers, but I gladly exchange the capacity of this one with my other smaller, less capacity portable chargers, despite its weight.  Taking this portable charger on my overseas trips will be an immeasurable benefit.  Even my other higher capacity chargers run out of juice if I am taking photos all day long with my phone with no opportunity to recharge.  There is also a neat little flashlight on the end of the battery pack.  You can use this flashlight to help plug in your electronic device in the dark - which helps immensely.  I highly recommend this charger for your portable needs!"
"Love simple sturdy, covers the  buttons but unlike other box it's thin enough that. I know I won't press extra hard"
Amazing case ..very sturdy! Go for a darker color the cherry blossom stains easy!! I have yellow stains from I don't know how?
Great headphones.  So far the battery lasts a long time.  Sound is good for videos and music.
"great kit. I bought both the Metra and Schoche kits. Although the Metra kit had better plastic, the Scosche kit fit much better and allowed the head unit to come further forward. overall satisfactory for the price."
"I don't know what kind of a piece of junk they sent me, but I do not have a charging port and it will not pair with my iphone6.  I also have a little cord that plugs into a port on my phone, but that seems to do nothing.  I am very disappointed in this selfie stick."
"US Cellular prepaid is just a sham.<br />They only activate over the phone or in person at one of their seven stores located in  Buttkeep Minnesota and AssherHat Iowa.<br /><br />They demand a credit check even acknowledging &#34;yepper, its a prepaid but I gotta check it&#34; and even with a 760 FICO score, still want a security deposit.<br /><br />These were brand new sealed phones from Amazon's stock, not &#34;Fulfilled by&#34;  not some toilet dropped wiped off brick from an Amazon Marketplace scammer but true, actual new phones and making them work is a fantasy."
Awesome... very cool looking and sleek.. gets the job DONE!. .. a little heavy but that was expected.. will Def buy again if I need another
A very useful product. I take it with me when I travel and it charges all my electronic devices.
Having the place to keep debit/credit card and ID makes life so much easier. Love this case.
I use with two 8 inch in a ported box wired in 2 ohms. This makes it sound much much bigger. Amp never complains!
I got these stylus's to use with my samsung tablet and found that they are very light weight so theywork at times and at times they do not. They do fit esily in my hand which makes them easy to hold and use as well. I say do the research and if these work with your smart device then good for you. They are nicely priced so they are a good deal to be had.
"Bought it for an apple iPhone. for Virgin Mobile. Did not work, it was so frustrating that Virgin sent me a free sim card. Very bad experience."
Piece of crap.  Already not working and I bought it 3 months ago.
"This is a cute power bank from Sentey. I got this in pink hoping to keep it away from my husband as he has took some of the other ones I had. It worked!<br /><br />This little power pack is not the slimmest thing, but I am still able to fit it and my lg acesss into my back pocket, though I do have to remove them before sitting down, where I  could normally leave my phone in my pocket. I got this hoping for something to easily put in my diaper bag and change my phone on day trips. This is light weight and fits nicely in a bag without taking up too much room or adding tons of extra weight!<br /><br />I love that this power pack also has a built in flashlight! Never know when your going to need one. Also I can change two devices at once, as long as I have my own cords. This power bank does have an on and off button and lights that help you to know how much charge is left in it.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent power bank and is nice to easily take on day trips. It seems to charge my phone about 2-3 times before dying. Considering my battery is 2440mAh and I'm generally using my phone while it's charging, I would say it puts out about what it's supposed to. This isn't something I would recommend if you needed long term and a fast change, but it is nice for when needed on a day out!<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
"Came scratched, doesn't stay on, not metal, hate it!"
"[[VIDEOID:95879b2fb18a0f936c31fdf7711179ba]]I have seen several type of these cases that have the kick out so you can stand up your iPhone 6 either horizontal or vertical but this one by Collen is far superior then others out there. The material and the construction are great quality and vibrant colors. The fit is perfect. The instructions did not state if you kept the two pieces together or not. We found it easier to separate the \\""gray\\"" hard backing from the silicone \\""green\\"" piece. As you can see in the video it is easy to install on your iPhone 6. All of the phone buttons work perfectly with the case on and it is very stylish. It does come in several different colors but I choose the green/gray since that is one of my husbands favorite colors. He drives a Jeep and there is a perfect spot to place his iPhone 6 with the kick stand horizontal so he can use his GPS in his Jeep it sits perfectly. He too is very impressed with the quality of this iPhone 6 case and he has used at least 10 different cases. I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased and honest opinion."
"Save your money. The cut out does not match the Note 5. The sides are cut crooked, the top and botom is cut short so there are lots of space. Very poor quality. Very disappointed since their Note 4 screen protector was well cut."
"This battery is excellent. It works perfectly like the original battery, more than 8 hours without charger and full use.<br />I recommend it, Great purchase!<br /><br />Sorry for my poor english. Im from Venezuela!<br /><br />Grettings for all!"
"When I bought the phone, I loved the leather curve to it. But qucikly found I needed a case for it.  But this particular model with the curve is almost impossible to find a case that works and looks good without being bulky and difficult.  This works perfect and is very slim looking"
"Excellent product the sound is great! I specially like the bass definition, by the other hand I ware it to run out and gym and it´s quite confortable with good fit, I definitelly recommend it."
This phone carrier ended up being to bulky and the stand wasn't that convenient
"Purchased for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it arrived yesterday.  It charges quickly has a very clear display. Nice design but you need to push the spring loaded adjuster (right side of battery) mechanism all the way out and it creates a ton of resistance on the springs. The plastic cover feels like it's going to snap off. If they would have designed it 2 mm wider this wouldn't be a concern.  If you don't have a wide battery, I would give this serious consideration. Pic posted for S4 owners with OEM battery.   I'll post back after a few months or when it breaks :-)"
"This portable charger is very good. It charges up my iPhone 6 to full really fast and keeps it running on my long journey from work each day. Otherwise the journey on public transportation would be hell without my phone and this Superpak keeps the power flowing.  The quality of the product is nice and durable. I've dropped it a couple times and noting broke; it keeps on working. The white color is fantastic with my iPhone and other accessories.  The small size and awesome  charging capability is why I really like this device. It doesn't take up much room in my purse and how light it is, I don't even notice it there.  I received this product from UNU's review program in exchange for my honest review."
Breaks easily. Rubber cover gets dirty fast & don't protect phone really well. Screen protector that comes with it is okay.
Seems ok so far after 1 month of usage. I did have other 3rd party replacement batteries that went flat very quickly after 2 weeks of usage. This is a quality product that I will not hesitate to recommend.
"Great case, I love the strap and the magnetic closing, it is very secure. Inside there is room for 3 credit cards and money etc."
I love this cable cord.  It works perfectly.  I use to charge my Samsung tablet and phone.  It gives me plenty of length to be able to charge and use my tablet and not be next to a wall.
Super smart watch. I love the notifications without having to check my phone. Great for meetings or when I'm on a job site.
"Picture quality is great and it has the largest screen I have ever seen on a portable player. HOWEVER, it is not the most solid construction. The door to the DVD holder busted after about 8 uses. It has a MUCH harder time reading a scratched disc than our regular dvd players. I would have loved this player if it was more durable, as the concept and image is awesome. Just need a higher quality construction. Now I cat return it, and I am out the $."
"I have been using this in my car, at work and at a home.  It works just like the official Apple charger."
Was exactly what I ordered. I am quite happy with my cover.
Great quality case for a great price. For a case like this at a mall you would pay SO much more.
"DO NOT BUY THIS CASE. I bought it early June because I was going to the beach for a week with some friends and needed to keep my phone charged. It worked great over the summer and my phone was always charged. However, last month the charger for the case got annoying and I had to situate my phone a certain way to charge it - got annoying. And last week, my phone started to randomly power off then signal that I needed to charge my phone, so I would turn on my charging case, and my phone would turn back on but be at 50% or higher (it never really needed the charging but it just said I did). And last night, my phone completely turned off and did not turn back on. The only screens I could see where the charging signal when I plugged it in, the apple logo would flash, and then a black screen. Today, I went to Verizon after numerous phone calls with Apple and Verizon, and after putting my iPhone in recovery mode on iTunes. Verizon told me my battery had probably died, so I went to a local computer store to ask for more help and they told me that my battery and circuit board were FRIED. Why? Because of this case. Non-apple chargers will DESTROY your phone. My phone did not like that charger, and so after these months it ruined my phone. My 5S (that I've only had for a year) is trash now - all because of this case. I suggest not buying this case or ANY off brand chargers because your iPhone will NOT like it. If you do buy this case, only charge when needed. Not everyday. I had to end up buying a iPhone 6 (taking my dad's upgrade) and it was NOT worth it. I am warning you - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
Shipped fast. Description was accurate. I'm happy with purchase.
This does fit my JAX S1360 just fine. It is a pretty rich purple color not pink at all. The makers don't say it fits the JAX but it really does just fine. I snipped 1/8 of an inch off at the bottom front (notched cutout edge) so it would not overlap the bottom keys. Otherwise it works well and makes the phone much less slippery and much easier to handle. This phone is the one that Assurance Wireless customers get through state Lifeline plans.
The case was great but it's the holster that comes with it  is too tight. You can't take out or put the phone in the holster with one hand.
So far great. We have old worn out car jacks. The average converter doesn't make contact well so tried this one it looked larger. It feels larger and better made. I've tried it in two of the worn jacks and it really works great. Constant contact better charge.
"This thing kicks butt. Major upgrade for my phone. I didn't use the included screen protector. I bought a 3-pack of JETech plastic screen protectors and they work flawlessly with this case.  Even though it doesn't have a kickstand (my only complaint with the design), this case fixes several issues with my S6. First, it provides a non-slippery surface for what is an ultra slick glass-backed phone that slides off of pretty much anything I leave it on. So now my phone doesn't careen off the center console of my truck like an air hockey puck while I gently glide up the driveway. The buttons and both parts of the case feel very solid, and neither flimsy nor manufactured with excessive tolerances. The case clipped together perfectly flush over my phone, and it looks really great and makes the phone just a tad beefier, which is nice because it makes it easier to keep a grip on the thing. I'm confident if I dropped it getting out of the car or while walking down the street, my phone would be safe even if the case were scratched/dinged or popped apart on impact.  Second, it provides amazing versatility as an extended battery. This was my biggest gripe with the S6 - subpar battery life with no way to buy an additional battery to swap in as necessary, or (my typical choice) a bigger extended battery to keep the phone going strong for up to a couple of days of regular, non-heavy usage. This rechargeable case elegantly solves the problem and does so flawlessly. The button is flush with the case and cannot be easily depressed on accident. You press and hold it for a couple seconds, and the case displays how much juice is left in it and immediately charges the phone. I was satisfied with the speed with which this is accomplished - I went from 65% to 100% in 40 minutes. This is precisely in line with the advertised 0%-100% full charge time of 2 hours.  Finally, the forward-facing stereo speakers are extremely loud and sound great, very clear. Definitely an upgrade from the bottom-mounted mono speaker the phone was designed with. Listening to tunes or playing games on the S6 without a Bluetooth speaker or headphones has never sounded so punchy and detailed. You can actually hear the stereo separation, and each track in the mix comes through pretty cleanly. I was impressed with the clarity and volume of the speakers.  One more downside to this case is that standard 1/8&#34; stereo plugs can't reach the headphone jack on the S6 when inside the case because the case is so thick, it prevents the plug from reaching the jack. Luckily, Alpatronix ships a small 1/8&#34; stereo extender with this rechargeable case, and I just leave it attached to the end of the aux cable in my truck. I guess if I used headphones a lot, it might be annoying to have to bring this little adapter with me everywhere I went in case I wanted to listen to some tunes, but since I only listen to music off my phone when driving, it is a negligible issue and was solved by the manufacturer rather reasonably.  Overall, I'm stoked. This was precisely what I needed."
"I originally purchased a black one for my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge based on my experience with the one I had for my prior cell phone. I loved it some much, I purchased a brown one. My requirements were that it had to be slim, protect the phone from scratches, easy to access, attractive and offer a way to carry it in & around the straps of various size pocketbooks. The pouch has 2 different loops for attaching it to a belt, purse or around the neck and came with a ring and a long string. Unfortunately, neither of these items work very well, at least for me. So I bought a foot of  small link chain from Home Depot , strung it through the inside loop opening and closed the ends with a ring used to hold keys. Now I can slide one end of the chain off and attach the pouch around the straps of different purses. With the small loop on the back, I attached a  3&#34; belt ring to hang it around larger straps or briefcases.  If, in the future I want to carry the phone on my body, I would buy a longer length of chain along with jewelry clasps and hang it across my body or on my shoulder. And finally, it fits nice and slim inside a larger purse just buy itself."
It doesn't charge my phone all the way and it over heats and the case dies fast and its flimsy
"The colors are great and they fit the Samsung Galaxy S5 pretty well, although I wish they fit a little more snuggly so they didn't come off so easily. The piece above where the phone gets plugged in is a little loose."
Clip fell off the device the second day and was lost. So disappointed to have wasted money for one day.
very strong and robust car charger. great product
"Perfect kit. It has everything you need to repair your iPhone. You have to put in the labor, but it is well worth it for the price and knowing the repair job is performed by you!"
"Durable. Have not had any issues. Dropped my phone in this case and no cracks, breaks or anything. Would recommend it. Like the sleek professional look of it as well."
hold the phone just fine but don't really like to use both hands to stretch open to insert the phone into it. Too much force.
"Very nice straightforward chargerss. I wanted something small and handy to use for plugging in my extra electronics for charging. I keep running out of wall outlets for usb plugs.This 2 pack Wall Charger set was perfect so I can carry both with me when traveling as well. I am always looking for an extra plug to charge my phone. They work for mobile phones, tablets, and the other smaller devices. They look really sleek and shiny and the plastic is by no means thin and it can handle a little tossing around just fine. I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my external battery pack without any issues at all. These wall chargers are way better than the original wall chargers that came with the products, and they charge both products faster than the original plugs. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest."
Piece of crap. Didn't even fit my phone and the back fell out of it. Guess that's what you get for only spending 5 bucks
"I bought this for my wife she love it,  its really beautiful and the rocks are good quality"
"Love it! Came quickly, fits my Note 4 perfectly and looks great!"
"The description is misleading, because I believed I was receiving a white case, but received a black one. Other wise a fine product."
Its a cord. Works or doesn't. This one did.
I like the idea of having a backup camera on E 250 cargo van.  Gives you a sense of security of not hitting the subject behind.  The wide angle is nice  and installation was just about one hour due to removal of panels. Display could be better quality and once hot it flickers. It is very light sensitive and the license plate light blurs the screen.
The six foot Anker cable is well made and should give years of service. Great price for it and the packaging for it is good considering it's just a cable.
This is a very sturdy looking retractable charging cord. It retracts really well and the flat design keeps it from tangling. I bought it based on all the wonderful testimonial reviews. Especially from owners of iPhones. Imagine my disappointment when I first plugged it into my iPhone 6 and I received an error message saying it's not compatible with my phone.
"I just received the black and gold case and I already LOVE IT!!!!!!! Looks really elegant with my iphone having a black face. It was very easy to put on, lightweight, and I also ordered a screen protector from Amazon to protect the top of my phone. This case feels so comfortable to handle and I love the idea of the cutouts not to interfere with the charger, etc. I've owned two LifeProof cases. They are extremely durable, nice and light to handle but ended up throwing them in the garbage. I had problems with the Life Proof case after owning it for around 6 months with volume being turned down, phone being on when I shut it off and draining my battery so many times. I cannot comment on how long the finish will last on this case but hope it holds up well. This case is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
the material is very cheap
Replacement battery for a 2.5 year old Samsung Galaxy S3. Works very well and keeps the phone charged for more than a day with minimal use.
This isn't what I got in the mail! I specifically ordered the one without the window on the front. The one I got was very similar but has a plastic window on the front of the book case.<br />Also the one I received in the mail didn't have the small flap that comes over the side to hold closed.<br />The picture isn't right either. The color of the case is washed out blue! The one in the picture is very blue and the one I got is almost not even blue. The harder part of the case that is that baby blue that holds the phone it's self is blue in the picture. The one I got was black.<br />It wasn't what I ordered. I don't want to hassle with sending it back. I'm just going to give it away.
The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that it wasn't as bright as I thought it would be like in the picture.
Soft case no protection here and a sloppy fit around the edges And whatever you do  DONT GET THE WHITE.After an hour in my soft case I wear on my belt it came out stained with black scuff marks.and they don't come clean up.
Purchased as a gift for my husband and he loves it! Was describes very well and even came earlier than expected!! Would definitely but from you guys again
This is a very light weight retractable Micro charger cord. I love the retractable cord I tem because we usually have cords going EVERYWHERE in our van. This makes it a lot easier to keep cords from tangling. Cable length is approximately 90 cm or 2.9 ft. I really like it has a usb port because that means I can charge my phone and so can my husband without fighting over who's phone will charge first.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount price in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review.
It's not how it's presented and the charger doesn't work at all. It's a waste of money.
Arrived with 2-day free shipping as promised.  Inserted my Cricket SIM and I was up and running in 5 minutes.  Nice size sharp 7&#34; clear screen.  Movies and videos are crisp.  Great value.  BLU products are changing the marketplace with quality low-cost competitive products.  I am normally a Samsung customer but BLU is starting to change that.
"I was looking for something that I could easily carry that would give me definitive control and allow for using my finger print capability of my iPad Air 2.  I had read some reviews on other products similar to this and found that it was not unusual for the rotating fame to  chafe the back of the iPad leaving a ring on the back of the iPad but this product provided sufficient clearance while allowing for 360 degrees of rotation.  the only thing that was not perfect to me is the strap on the back where you put your hand.  It i velcro but does not provide for an aesthetic presentation.  It has a retractable stand on the back that is quite nice allowing for set up of the iPad when I set it down and want to monitor the iPad, this functions perfectly.  Although I would redesign the hand strap,I would buy this again."
"Fast charging on two ports, normal for others. Other than that, great product, use it for travel too."
I like the mesh tipped stylus.  They are much more sensitive than the rubber tipped ones.
"Good cable that seems very robust, it's pretty thick but the head that plugs into the phone isn't any larger that the OEM cable so it still fits phones that have cases.  Edit 9/7/15: I seem to have reviewed a little early. Today I noticed that the head of the cable is separating from the cable and exposing the wire underneath. I contacted Amazon support and over the course of 23 minutes (on chat) got the same as others: the cable is more than 30 days old and can't be returned, after explaining (3 times) that I wasn't trying to return and that I wanted it exchanged I was told that they would create an &#34;exception&#34; to allow me to return it. I then told the chat rep that I would pick it up later with phone support. I offered the option of upgrading me to the &#34;fixed&#34; version of this cable and I would pay the difference, but was rejected.  I'm not sure if even updating this review is worth it as it looks like this product is no longer available, but I'll update it just in case it does become available again.  Amazon, get your issues sorted out on Amazon Basic warranties. You are the &#34;manufacturer&#34; and dealer for this product, you should be able to get this figured out. You as a company also need to get your reps on one page with regards to this issue."
Extremely cheap. Doesnt stay on the phone. Design is great though.
"Outstanding product! As with any screen protector that has adhesive to adhere to the screen, placing it on the screen can be a bit of a challenge. However if you do it properly the result is a great screen protector...one of the best."
I just received this charger and it's great. It works very well. Happy with the service and product.
Slips out of my hand way more than any case I have ever had. This is the first time i have shattered a phone screen.<br />Battery works when needed which is the only reason that I gave it any stars. Its starting to not always respond when i press the button. not sure if this is due to dropping it too many times.<br />I wish the back coating wasnt so slick and had a little more texture to grip to. I will probably be getting a Mophie instead
Excellent case.  Very sturdy but light weight
"I went to the Bahamas for vacation and participated in Pat & Tina's Snorkel Adventure in Freeport, Bahamas. I read about the FRIEQ Waterproof case prior to ordering based on customer reviews. I was ecstatic about this item since I'm a photographer in my own right take many pictures and selfies within a days time. I. really wanted to capture the essence of photos on and under water without damage to my smartphone. Well I must say I highly recommend this product it is all that and then some. Very easy storage and use of the smart phone while in the case. I snorkeled with the case around my neck connected to the lanyard and all I had to do was click away. My photos on my Samsung Galaxy were clear as a bell. The video recording was authentic underwater when recording. The only thing I had a problem with while underwater...when I pressed the button to record, it didn't recognize the command underwater, so I just pushed the button above water and recording was in process while I proceeded to go under."
"My husband likes the fact that his phone is protected, but doesn't care for the fact that it makes the phone so big and cumbersome....wish he would keep it on though!!!"
"Bought the Geekout 1000 a couple of weeks back. Boy was I blown away. it may seem deceptively small but the sound it produces will blow your mind. the moment the geekout is plugged in, it makes the entire song come alive and one can be lost in the subtle nuances of the music forever. best DAC I ever had."
Tried to disinfect my phone once with a rubbing alcohol wipe. Basic Isopropyl alcohol. It DESTROYED the protector with scratches and swirl marks. How am I supposed to clean my phone after lab??
I love the case but at the first day the metallic part got scratch is not a lot but i thought it wouldnt scratch
"This far exceeded my expectations of the quality for the price!  And the seller shipped extremely quick.  It has a built-in screen protector that I worried wouldn't be as responsive as a sticky film protector, but it has been great.  My eight year old has been the one using this, and no complaints from her either.  The stand stays out of the way pretty well, but is also removable (and can be used on either side) and since it wasn't a feature she was using, we just took it off completely.  The silicone is thick and durable with extra padding on the corners - I think it should protect it from most drops.  The color is a true red and very attractive."
Just what I needed. Great value.
The same as the $40 one in stores just nicer on the wallet. I'm really rough on phones so I keep one in reserve so when I break it I can switch it out. So far they've lasted longer than the ones I've payed full price for
I am in the process of ordering this device and I am saying to myself oh what would we do without our gadgets.
"Update to original review.  My concern was that without extension nibs the plugs would be hard to remove.  As it turns out, they are very easy to remove even with a thicker case.  No problems at all."
"The screen protector have a grid of dots, as per the seller it's meant to improve the response to touching of the screen, but for me this is bad and I didn't get to use it at all because I just hate having to see those dots on my high quality screen colours. I wish I knew about this before buying it!"
"Fits snug, looks good. I would suggest getting the black case with the black edition and the silver case with the white edition, but that's just preference in my opinion.<br />Pros: easy to install, stylish, protection from light drops, and not easily damaged. Also allows clearance for camera and front screen when set on table<br />Cons: none that I have experienced yet"
The old battery would not hold a charge but this new one has worked great .
"I'm pretty new to Anker products but so far every time I have purchased from Anker I've been very satisfied. This is the best car charger I've owned. I've used up to 3 ports at a time and it works well all the time. I'd recommend this to anyone. If you're not sure, I say just go for it. You'll be satisfied! Even if you aren't... Anker customer service is the absolute best."
"It worked for a little while (a few months), but then I'd have to hold the cord in place for it to start charging. Sometimes when it would start charging, the phone would pop up a message that said it wasn't supported by Apple and wouldn't work at all."
"Omg I love this case . Seriously the absolute best best best best case ever. The only thing I could say is that I wish they had some that had designs or sayings or something, otherwise this is the best case I've ever bought. I don't have to carry my phone and a wallet."
"This stand came in a sturdy white box, absolutely suitable for wrapping and gift giving. Upon removing from the box, I was pleasantly surprised that it felt so sturdy and well made. There is a slot in the back to run your iPhone charging cable through, as well as a spot to &#34;dock&#34; your apple watch. It looks bigger in the picture, and I was relieved that it was much smaller upon opening the package. There are rubber feet on the bottom, and I was happy to see that it doesn't move easily across my desk. The design is awesome, and I love it. I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review."
"Great fit and easy to put on. No bubbles. Depending on your case, it corners may push up a bit."
I upgraded from the Lumia 521.<br />I like everything about the Lumia 640 XL especially the big bright screen. I am using it with GoSmart Mobile with no problems.
"My cell phone is my only source of communication, it's great to know I have a back up.  I wasn't sure which size to get, glad I decided on the 20w"
It does chip and crack the edges pretty easily but my phone has fallen flat on its face many times and the protector hasnt fully cracked. This is my second one because the first one died protecting my phone's screen during a nasty fall. This is smooth and i feel no difference between this and the actual phone glass.
"Very good and comfortable headphone. Sound quality to me sounds better than the Beats these replaced. Very good price, they don't feel cheap."
"Unit works fine but I thought it was the type that plugs directly into the wall instead of via a cable.  Nothing wrong functionally just not as compact when traveling. I kept the product because it does what it's intended, just wish I read more carefully before purchase."
"Seems to be good quality. Zipper is heavy duty so it won't fall apart easily. However, it's A LOT bigger than I was expecting and talking on my phone while it's in this case is a very difficult and awkward task. I like the case and love the idea of having all of my cards and phone in one spot together, but unfortunately I'll be returning it for a smaller one."
Great audio.  Lousy battery life.  The battery is lucky to last more than gan 30 minutes.
"It works better than the glass screen protector I had bought before this.  It is easy to place and is invisible to the eye once in,  plus they give you 3 screens. A great deal."
I was very impressed when I got this case. It is made really well and fit my phone like a glove. It fits my buttons on my phone and I have no problem using them which I really like. The case itself protects my phone from being damaged. Nice pink and purple colors. This case is two parts and they are a harder plastic type material. I have to use a screen protector with this case to protect my screen and the case helps to protect my phone from being damaged.I would recommend this Iphone 5C case from MagicMobile. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.
"Good connection with my nexus 4.  The USB charging port wore out, this is extending the life of my phone. Phone gets moderately war!m while charging, and I get full charge in 4-5 hours.  Orientation is easy, just center the phone and it works.  I sometimes place it in my car cupholder at an angle and put the phone on top, and it works well there too.  Significantly easier to align thanks qi alarm clock I used it with before.  Only problem is sometimes I knock it off the pad when sleep walking."
Very stylish. Waterproof. Everything works and is pretty comfortable. If you have a large wrist it may not be big enough. I'm 6'2&#34; 240 lbs. And i am on the second last hole on the band
installing this thing was easy first time i ever installed a car stereo...Bluetooth is awesome you don't have to reconnect every time you turn on the car it automatically connects to your phone so just hit the play button and it will start playing the music that you have on your phone....if you want to use the hands free calling you might wanna hook up the mic that comes with it otherwise the people on the other end of the call  will not hear you.....in my situation i wasn't able to speak through my phone while it was Bluetooth to the stereo...the touch screen is pretty responsive so that's good.......oh and i installed this in my 2006 Nissan Altima and did not need to buy a antenna  you can still use the factory antenna
Junk  Freezer bag
Loved the look and I know I'm rough on cases but the rubber and the image started to peel pretty quickly :( expected more from otterbox
"This is an awesome deal! The quality is top notch. The color is vivid and bright. I was very impressed with the texture and toughness of braided sheath. This is definitely worth buying.  I am planing on ding it but this time in different colors than the orange and blue set, although I might just order another one of these as well. I love em soo much."
"A well made product, but it didn't allow the use of the iPhone case as i've become used to. the dimensions given didn't make it clear that the iPhone + a case wouldn't fit in the holster as I had experienced with one from years ago."
"I am always looking for a new case for my phone that will let it be more useful, enter the Card Slot Slim Armor case by Spigen. It features a solid case with the added benefit of having a slot for 2 credit cards. I used to use a Bulldog case and it added a little bulk but not much, this case by spigen ups the bulk a tiny bit but then again it function as a wallet as well and that is worth the bulk. The case has a rubber lib that covers the front of the screen to keep it raised so if you lay the phone face down (or drop it) the phone screen will be protected. The back is a hard plastic but has that removable slot for your cards to go into it. It only holds 2 cards, don't try to load more than that in it otherwise it will bulge and the slide/door could break. It works really well for what it is and I have no complaints over it other than this one, it makes the phone a tad slippery and because of that I am removing a star.

This is a great product it's made from a  strong durable material  that really helps protect my phone!  I love the bright mint color it looks great on my white iPhone. The case also has a lip on the front that  helps might protect my phone while it was laying facedown .  This is an all-around great phone case I'm so glad I was given this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review !
My husband loves these.  Just wish the charge lasted longer.
"I ordered my watch band and was very pleased! Although, I did not read the reviews ahead of time and the screw for my adapter fell out. I was unable to find it. I work at the Apple Store in Raleigh and when your $500 watch falls on the floor in the middle of the store with 300 people it's hard to find a screw that small... It would be helpful if I could find the size for the screw so I could replace it. If anyone knows, it would be a great help."
"The screen was locked at first, but Samsung helped with a factory reset.  After that, the watch exceeded expectations.  A great entry into the smart watch market."
The item is very bad quality..the glue is worst quality..i followed all the instructions and i was about to break my phone the next day because the glue went off. I don't recommend this item to anyone.. i consider my money was thrown in the air.
Used this on my daughter's ALREADY cracked screen.  It did seem to stop the crack from getting worse.  She got no further damage to her phone while she used this screen protector.  Wished she had this to start with.  Make sure you have a clear work space when attaching the cover.
They did not stay in my ears what so ever and the cord was too long for my taste. I ordered them because they were &#34;CNET's pick&#34; but ended up returning them.
"Big fan, simple and effective. Both my wife and I are now using it, would recommend it for anyone who spends a lot of time in their car or lives in a state where holding a phone while driving is a no no.<br />Gripper arms are stringer than expected, a secure hold."
It began to crack and broke when it fell spend more money on a better one trust me
"Bought this for spouse. She doesn't like smart phones. Works great for her but cannot turn off data like on a smart phone. Had to contact the carrier and have her number blocked from data usage. Overall, good phone."
This is not the replacement for my current remote alarm set/door opener. I am returning them.
perfect condition<br />Thank You!
At first the case looks and feels great. After a few months the poor craftsmanship starts showing.
its works properly to adroid phone samsung s3 .<br />calls and text messages works only for iphone 6  and 6+ .<br />overall  ill give 3 stars !  price wisely!
"Works exactly as the original...contacted SanDisk first, and they gave me the run a round trying to get a replacement...buying this was much easier than dealing with SanDisk."
So far so good.  I've had it for a few weeks and it's working great.  The case is sturdy without being bulky. I like the portal placement and functionality as well. The holster holds on tight and the swivel is really nice. My experience has been good and I recommend the product.
"Love my case and I receive so many compliments on it. The only thing I have to say is that with in a few days some areas started to chip. Other than that, Iove this case and it has been on my phone for a little over a month now."
"I personally don't own an iPhone 5(S) (let alone any iPhone), but I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn't make up their mind about which case to get. That being said, they were naturally happy to receive this case because it afforded them the quality of an OtterBox case to an extent without costing as much. What makes this case even nicer, is that it has swappable plates so he can change it depending on his mood."
"I am giving this 5 stars. For the price, you can't go wrong and the sounds quality is really good. the base is deep, sound is crisp and you can hear everything clearly as if it was a wired set. This comes with different sized earbuds and they are comfortable. I think design and cord makes these very light and easy to wear during activities like bike riding, running, gym activities or casual wear. I tested the calls quality and I didn't hear any complaints. For the price and quality I would recommend."
Great simple case!
Exactly as described. Holds my iPhone 5s in a case and makes driving much safier and easier
"love this case! I'm usually all about Otterbox but they seem to have cut a few corners with the new ones. The Otterbox case for my iPhone 5s stretched and didn't work after less than a month. I bought two of these (one for my husband) and I love it. It's slim so it fits in my pocket better. I also love the water resistant feature as we both work jobs where we end up soaked with sweat. Now I can keep my phone on me in case of emergencies and not worry about it being wet with bodily grossness. Lol! My one year old threw my phone across a room with hardwood floors where my dog, thinking it was a game of fetch, promptly ran over and snapped it up. The case had a couple of tiny knicks taken out of it but everything else was fine! The only thing I would change would be to make the backing a bit more like rubber so it catches on slick surfaces. I've also got an a**hole for a cat so even if my phone is out of reach of the kiddo, she'll knock it down for her own amusement. I'd say it's hit the floor pretty hard more than a dozen times because of the cat and my phone has suffered NO damage."
Cute and does the job of protecting phone. The color does rub off after a few weeks in the most used parts of the phone. This is very unnoticeable to others and not a big deal.
Great charger and would recommend this product to anyone!. It has a small charging cord and pouch. Worth its weight in gold!
"The headline says it all. Don't buy this watch if you are expecting to use the GPS, as it does not work. Search the internet and you will see that this is a known issue and that Sony will do nothing to resolve it (Refund? ha! Warranty repair? Ha!).  What a waste of $200."
"I would give it 5! I bought this at the beginning of February 2015. I have used this thing basically every day since. I dropped it two days ago and it's unaffected! Still works like a charm. On a completely full charge, I can charge my Samsung S5 and my girlfriend's iPhone and still have enough juice to recharge my S5 two more times.<br /><br />I love this battery do much, I just bought another one and it was delivered today...SUNDAY!<br /><br />5 stars all around. Very dependable, very durable,  it surpasses my expectations at the &#34;under $40&#34; price point.<br /><br />Well done!"
"Pos! Would not support iphone 6 anymore after owning it since November, suppose to have 1 year warranty, when I called customer service he told me they would do a one time exception and refund it (excuse me but what about my warranty).  Will never buy this again and they should stand by their products! Wish I could give the whole experience a zero"
we had one already and it broke so we ordered another shipping a little too high but good product overall
On time Delivery and the product is as described. Happy customer
"Bought these cables to work with several iPhones in our house that live inside Lifeproof cases.  Fits perfectly!  Thank you!  I love the idea of the Lifetime Warranty as these cabels (mostly the Apple originals) wear out quickly.  I hope to never have to call in on my warranty, but happy to know they are there.  I know where I am coming to purchase cable replacements the next time a non-Luxtr cable wears out.  Thanks again!"
"Very sturdy case, easy to grip. I recommend this for any LG phone owner."
"Bought 4 of these, they work great, provides plenty of power for dual devices."
"Only received ONE screen protector when clearly, the description says &#34;3-pack.&#34; I've contacted Tech Armor, and they haven't coordinated a replacement yet."
"A definite buy if you're looking for inexpensive, reliable, good-sounding bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />I previously used the Beats in-ear headphones during my workouts. I wanted a set of bluetooth headphones to avoid having to worry about the cord in between my iPhone and headphones. These headphones fit the bill perfectly. They obviously don't sound as good as the expensive Beats ones, but they are good enough for workouts. They do a terrific job of isolating noise, so I don't recommend them for running outside. Inside, like the gym or on a treadmill, they are perfect for isolating you from the rest of the world. I have no problem with them staying in my ear while running or lifting weights. The key is to try the included, different sized-earpieces to get the best fit. Battery life is good, they last about 3-4 hrs; I only keep them powered while working out.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
It is what I expected. Not the best feel to the plastic
Better than I imagined it would be. This is a high quality band that looks and performs as well as the official Apple band. Only difference is its a fraction of the cost.
"I had a blu phone before but this one is exceptional phone, it weighs more than what I had before, I like it and the price is so convenient"
I like this case it's what it comfortable and fit exactly perfect on my iPhone 6 Plus I'm very happy with this case
"I needed a case for  my oversized work issued LG Vista G cell.<br />Arrived less than a week after ordering.This is a good value and<br />PERFECT for my needs!The fabric body/metal clip combination makes<br /> all the difference.This case is rugged,solidly built and comfortable while<br /> clipped to my waistband on the job.I'd had an all plastic holster case for<br />a previous phone(Samsung Galaxy III mini ); that holster case<br /> was awkward to handle and uncomfortable on my person AND<br /> the plastic clip broke.<br />I highly recommend it for larger, hard to fit phones."
"The design and quality of this case is really excellent. This case will protect your phone from just about anything you can throw at it. You can put your phone in this case and not need to worry one bit about damaging it.<br /><br />So far I've taken this iPhone 6 adventure/underwater case with us to the water park and the lake, and the pictures have all turned out awesome. The picture quality while using this case is far better than I expected it to be. The four lenses are all excellent. They take really outstanding pictures. I particularly like the pictures taken with the wide angle lens.<br /><br />I can't imagine there being a better adventure/underwater case with lenses out there. We have been nothing but happy with it. This is a terrific adventure/underwater case. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this adventure/underwater case, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful."
love this the letter feels amazing had it for 2 years now and still looks as good as it does when I got it now if not better than
"The headset has the most awesome sound and, it takes 10- 15 to charge it for 5 hours. Comfortable to wear, sound is great. I love it. Well worth the amount I paid."
I've had it for about 2-3 weeks now & it's still hanging tough. I dropped my phone face down at work and my screen is still fine & the case has the smallest scratch on the top left corner ( barely noticeable ). I enjoy the mini stylus it came with too. Definitely worth 8 bucks.
"Expensive, and takes 2 weeks to get, but it seems Apple products only charge correctly with factory Apple charge cords, which is a shame."
"I give 5 stars because the performance of this phone is excellent having in consideration the price,LTE,OS lollipop ,fast respons etc.No complaint for battery and camera didn't expected first quality for the price I paid"
"This case came fast and is very good quality. I'm using it for an Alcatel One Touch Icon Pop, as had read a couple of reviews saying it would fit ok. I easily cut out pieces over the volume and off/on switches on the right side, so it's easier to use those buttons now. The case is very good protection against damage, plus I've gotten compliments on how attractive it is."
Got what I paid for. Super cheap. Broke within days.
"This case is very rugged and protects the iPhone very well, but the built-in screen protector makes the phone very difficult and frustrating to use.  The screen protector doesn't sit directly upon the phone's screen, there is a tiny bit of airspace between, so you have to push in with a bit of force to do anything with the phone.  This makes texting, zooming in or out, scrolling etc. all difficult.  The home button is also covered by a thin membrane, so Touch ID doesn't work as well as usual either.  I read online about removing the built-in screen protector and using a thin glass one instead, but decided it would be easier to just return it and find a different solution."
"Will not charge iPhone or iPad, junk, do not buy this."
"Worst headphones ever.<br /><br />They skip music all the time: while walking, while pulling your phone from your pocket, while sitting down, while standing up, while turning. You get the picture. No sudden movements, or the audio skips.<br /><br />Terrible: after just 3 uses, the USB-power side cable removed itself from the unit - see photo.<br /><br />And what's weird and unexplainable: these headphones randomly click buttons on my Android smarthphone, and send map location data to unknown Google Hangouts recipients - also see photo. I mean, I could click the &#34;power&#34; button on the device and it would send random interactions to the phone, like clicking ads in Spotify or opening Maps. Not cool.<br /><br />I'm returning."
"Its the best i Ever had. I had broke the first one, and i ordered another one. Dropped my phone on the floor twice ,and the glass did not shatter."
"This review has taken me a while to write,first I gave this phone as a gift to my father. He is over sixty years old and has little to no tech savvy when it comes to cell phones. I wanted to get him an unlocked cellphone so he would not have to worry about the price tag or when he decides to change carriers. He absolutely loves this phone. First of all, the screen is HUGE, I have a LG G2 and it makes my screen look small. It comes in very cool colors and it is actually quite sleek. The apps and software on the phone are not to bad. So if you like having a nice cellphone, but you may not be too tech savvy this is definitely for you. Also, the phone is an amazing deal. You get a great, stylish phone, and you get a screen protector, as well as, a cell phone case. This phone is truly great. When my father went to go get a sim card and showed it to one of the employees, the employee fell in love with his phone. Honestly, I would have gotten this phone for myself if I had known it was so cool instead of paying $400 dollars on my LG.  This is a most definite yes, If I could I would live to advertise this cell phone and the brand"
Basic cover for back of iPad mini however is overly easy to attach and remove (could see it falling of if dropped).
I love this case.  The color is exactly what I expected.  It appears as if I purchased a new phone. The grip is nice and it provides protection for my phone.
"I think this glass looks better than the $20 one I got talked into buying at the Verizon store. That one had broke in about 2 weeks, so I needed a replacement. So far so good. It was super easy to put on my phone. The sticker guides that come with it made it super easy to line up perfectly."
"Exactly what I was looking for a full featured standard size smartphone at considerably less price.  The phone is in perfect condition looks just like new.  For phone service I use Tracfone &#34;Bring Your Own Phone&#34;.  Since it's a second phone I just do 90 days at $20, roughly $6.66 a month.  I had a SIM chip from Tracfone already for Verizon type phones.  We have WiFi here which covers a lot of my use."
I had high hopes for these cords but my first one only lasted about 3 weeks. Maybe I'll have better luck with the next two but so far not a good purchase. So disappointed! :(
Doesn't charge the device very quickly when plugged in but works fine. I wish it was clearer that I needed to plug it into a power source for it to work.
Great for price only been using one at the moment but the head where you plug it in your phone slides off and on but still charges phone fine
"looks ok except for the letters on the back , they should leave the back blank without the white writing it spoils the case"
"Piece of junk! It actually sucks the life out of the remaining battery in my phone!!!! I thought maybe it was just my car but I tried it in my husband's as well and it does the same thing! Before I plug in my phone it says I have 17% remaining battery life, after I plug it in & check it in 10 minutes it says 12% remaining!!! I though hmmm.... maybe I just need to leave it on longer & wait.....NOPE!! In the next half hr it was completely DEAD!!!"
"I had recently upgraded my phone from the S3 to the S6. Most of the time when holding my S6 with one hand and at an angle to get a better view at what I am reading or viewing, the phone slips off my hand and falls down to the floor. Not good at all. Since my phone is new, I was afraid for it to get damage from constant dropping on the floor. I bought this Samsung Galaxy S6 phone case by Collen in gold color. The color gold is transparent but the color is still visible. The material made out of it is really nice, pliable, and seems durable. The material is not too thick which I really like. It does fit like a glove on my S6 and my phone in this protective case does not slip off of my hand! I do recommend this product, it comes in different colors. I chose the gold and it gives my phone a more classy look to it. My husband  even commented on how nice the case is and wants one for his Note 4. I am glad to have purchase this product and have waited for the perfect opportunity. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest opinion."
Great case for my oversized HTC ONE Max! Keeps phone safe and dry - took to ball game and stayed nice and dry through the rain!
"This flat USB A to USB MIcro B with a Micro B female to Lighting Male adapter works with just about any of my devices. IOS, Android or Windows. One cable to rule connect them all for power and sync.<br /><br />The cable feels expensive, though it's quite fairly priced. It comes with nice covers to protect the connectors. I expect these will get lost but they are a nice touch for a travel cable that may get banged around.<br /><br />Unlike most USB and lightning cables this is a flat cable. It rolls nicely and so far seems more resistant to becoming a &#34;rats nest&#34;. The USB A and Micro B connectors and the Micro B femaile to Lightning male are all finished in a soft-feel grey finish. The connector grips feel rich and nice.<br /><br />I like this cable and now I don't need pack at least 2 cables to connect all my travel devices for sync and charging. When I'm traveling little things like this make more of a difference than I would have thought. Once less thing toe keep track of and it works great so far.<br /><br />Because it makes my life a bit more simple and works well for me I'm handing this lighting/micro USB B cable 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!"
"I was extremely pleased with the fit and appearance of this case, but the plastic framework that holds the phone in place on the top left side broke with a few weeks.  I glued it back together, and it has broken again, about an inch from the the first break.  I love the case itself, but am disappointment that the framework that holds the phone is so weak.  Is this typical of this case, or did I perhaps get a defective one?"
Side button on both sides are very hard to push I also have one for a iPhone 6 plus that is the same way I've been using it for about a month and I'm not too happy with this product. Color options were good but that's it
Overall a good case firm fit very thin only drawback is that when the back side of it is squeezed against the back of the phone (it always is bec of firm fit) it creates  a smudgeyy kind of  look very unappealing.
"In case you do not know, the entire case is not SOLID plastic. This is a GOOD thing. It is hard plastic on the corners and sides. It is not plastic (and is some sort of rubber material) on the places where normal hard plastic cases break. It makes the phone look &#34;rugged&#34;. The kick stand works fantastically."
"I got two styluses that both have replaceable tips.  You get extra tips when you buy these styluses.  However, I bought extra tips in case they stop making this kind of stylus in the near future because I've had that happen before.  And as far as I know, the styluses only come in pink and purple.  Maybe they offer more colors now."
WORKS JUST PERFECT FOR MY LG 4G STYLO PHONE
"I bought this set on Amazon July 10, 2015 and went dead August 24 2015. I went to see if i could return it but read that it was too late to return. I was very disappointed with this product and Amazon should keep away from this type of product. Don't waste your money. It worth less than a star."
"This product flat out doesn't work.  The suction cup doesn't suck onto tiles in pools, and you can't hear anything under water."
"Grips my phone well and unlike some other mounts, allows me to change the angle easily. Because it sticks out a bit from the CD slot, it does bounce and flex a bit over rougher roads, but it's still usable."
"Broken, better selfie sticks on the market."
Just right.  Arrived quickly.  Definitely very durable; I had the same brand case for an iPhone 4.  And you can't beat the price!
"i bought this charger last year but rarely used it, I think I had only recharged it to full 3 times and used it to charge my Samsung phone less than 10 times throughout the year. Now it's so dead wont charge nor being charged. Huge shame it is really piece of junk and what the manufacturer is doing to the environment producing these junk  Update: after previous review Anker sales contacted me immediately and sent a replacement. The replacement works so far and I hope it won't  fail after few use again. They also addressed my concern about the disposal of the faulty one, they paid postage to ship back the faulty piece. I am happy with how I was treated and update my review here"
"This jammed in my car's radio as soon as I put it in - I can't comment on sound quality, as I've had no way to test it. Quite a disappointment, given the other positive reviews."
"I've had used different devices from iPhones to Galaxy Notes, iPads and BlackBerrys but boy I'm glad I took a leap and went to BlackBerry! This is the best phone ever. It runs Android apps so you won't miss those productivity apps you have on your previous device(s).<br /><br />Somebody had a great review here so I won't even try to convince you. I will just say, get the device, use the device and then give your verdict. It's awesome!"
"Quite disappointed with the suction cup because it does not hold that strong. It always fell, if not on the dash board on the floor. I just put it aside."
"Easy to place and microphone easily. We have I phone 6, note 3 and note edge it fit all 3. Held onto phone during drive and you can angle it fo better viewing. The really nice part is it can be easily moved to where you need it instead of being stuck to the dash like a p previous one."
Nice neat cover. Not intended to be a wallet
I feel confident if I dropped my phone in this case (which I have done accidentally) it will protect it.
"I loved the case when I first received it, but within 48 hours two rhinestones came off the back and the case is very hard to get on/off my phone."
Holster is not the same in the picture but still awesome!
The  product it self is good it just doesn't cover the entire screen it come short I think they need to redesign in order to cover entire scree length wise and  sideways
You will have to press buttons harder due to the screen interfering with screen sensitivity. Great screen protector overall. I would definitely recommend.
Leather is not top quality.....hope they make better quality
These headphones are great! Got them as a gift and they're so much better than the iPhone ones I had been using!
no it took forever to charge my phone up. it always said 5 hours to charge and have my phone over heated.
"Bad stuff , they send me a broken one ...I threw it away ..."
Awesome and charges my Gear Fit without an issue!
"Lightweight, attractive, solid, convenient -- and it works! This is exactly what I was looking for to charge my Moto X."
Fast shipping. Love the colors.
Easy to apply and works great.  Have used it for a few months and it has definitely protected my phone.
Made out of strong material.  Great protection for your phone.
"I have the note 5 and doea not cover the screen at all. I took it to Verizon because  I'm really bad to apply screens and it didn't do much better, they advise to return.<br /> Very disappointing actually waste of money<br /><br />Will be returning it."
"just wasn't what I thought it would be, it connects to my phone fine, but I have to continue to download different apps to access all the features of the phone, music app, workout app, a app to download other apps its just too much for one off brand device"
The application for it does not work and the watch does not connect to the phone properly. I tested it on a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. Only call notification works but the contact name doesn't show on the watch. I will be returning the phone because of false advertising of functionality by the seller. The watch looks nice which is why I gave it 2 stars.
"Terrible. Not the item I ordered at all. The borders I received are white. The Ravens logo and lettering are blurry, and at the bottom there is text that says: 16- Month Plan Ner<br />Septersber 2014-December 2015.<br />I am high disappointed and want my money back."
"Gets stuck to the screen, and the silence switch breaks off. It is also a pain in the butt  to get it off, DON'T BUY IT."
Great armband carrier for my Note 4. Great 1 year guarantee too! After 9 months of normal wear and tear stitching started to come apart on armband. Contacted Avantree support very quickly received reply. No hassle replacement for new armband just had to pay $6 for shipping of new one!
"Put this on my phone as soon as it arrived.  8/29, I accidentally dropped my phone on the pavement.  Landed frontside down, the protector cracked but there was NO DAMAGE to my phone.  I have reordered."
"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! The pattern on my case was slightly off centered, but it's only slightly noticeable. I received many compliments on this case."
Loved the look and I know I'm rough on cases but the rubber and the image started to peel pretty quickly  :( expected more from otterbox
Got this for my mom for christmas she loves it. It can fit into her purse and charges her phone and kindle!
It's ok; a very good product.
"Excellent product, beside of the small size, I specially like the versatility of the dual function as transmiter and receiver which work perfect! I definitelly recommend it."
Nice case..slim design
"Gives new life to my Bose 30pin docking station for my Bose radio.  I plug in the Coolstream, sync to my phone and streaming begins.  Very easy.  The only thing I'd like is an on/off switch.  Once it's plugged in the bluetooth light is always on so I have to remove it from the dock when done.  Not a big deal but I'd rather have a way to switch it off.  Great little product and does it's job really well - do not hesitate to buy."
Is rubbish need to leave it charging all night so you can use it for two hours plus that can not be recharged in a car as it requires high voltage coriente.<br /><br />es una basura necesitas dejarlo cargando durante toda la noche para que puedas utilizarlo durante 2 hora además que no puede ser recargado en un coche ya que requiere de coriente de alto voltaje
Ordered this product to replace my current usb charger and the one I ordered stopped working. I attempted to try and return and I cant.
"It didn't exactly line up on the edges, hung over a bit. And the camera whole did not match, was off about 1/4 inch.."
"I really like this case. It came earlier than expected. Nice quality, I like the feel of it and how it looks on my phone."
"no stars, terrible sound, no one can hear me on my phone with this case."
This product advertises traffic monitoring but in reality it only uses &#34;traffic maps&#34; to analyze patterns. These maps do nothing for a city like Atlanta where accidents happen daily. I suppose part of the blame could be on me for not researching the details of the product features but when I see &#34;traffic maps&#34; I assume it is in real-time. In reality I am required to buy a second device that must fit into a cigg lighter port (which is broken in my vehicle) so this device was useless to me.<br /><br />The battery is also very shot-lived with only 1-2 hours before a charge is needed..<br /><br />If you are going to spend this much on a GPS device I'd suggest spending just a little more and getting the device that has &#34;real-time&#34; traffic built in.
We got this case on 6/28/2015. My son dropped his 5C last night (8/30/2015) and his screen cracked.
This is a good dash cam but there no book or  any thing on the web on this. It is teach you self.
Temper glass looks and feels great on my phone. Only issue I had with this was the procedure from not peeling off correctly. Other than that is great ď
Great product for the price. Keep one in my purse at all times. Works quickly and easily. Couldn't ask for more.
"Ok so far, material could be more sturdy but no regrets."
Works as indicated. Great product. Charges cellphones very fast when installed on wires that go straight to the battery as I had on my motorcycle.
"These are great!  I accidentally dropped wire cutters on my phone.  They gashed/cut the screen protector, but my phone screen was unharmed."
"It was exactly the color and style I wanted,  but the paint on the sides started to chip after only 1 week of getting it"
"They fit fine on RCA female jacks. However, they are hard to remove if you change your mind; I wished they had a knob attached so you could pull them off with ease, like with some Firewire and e-Sata connector covers.  Still they do the job."
"Not at Twelve South regular standards, just as many in here and as the pictures show, the soft touch on the case is gone and the wallet is falling apart after a month, i got a replacement from twelve south which followed the same fate as the first wallet. This product is such a disappointment. I've had Twelve South's book book since they brought it out to market and they always been a great crafted wallet. This version for the Iphone 6 is complete crap. Don't waste your money unless they bring back the quality wallets they used to have."
"This case is awesome. The colors are a great combination that you just don't see together very often. I love that the case came with a stylus, that matched the case. The stylus is nice & thick, so it's easier to hold onto than some others that I have had in the past. My phone fits in the case very well. I will say that at first, the case is rather stiff, however, I was able to get it more pliable once I bent it and worked where it folds quite a bit. That didn't take too long, either! There are many times that I don't want to have to carry my purse or wallet with me when I'm going into the store, so I'll take my money & put it in the case, along with any cards that I might need, and that's great! I can NOT get my phone to fall out of the case, and I have tried, hard, it just won't come out! I did notice that if you place too many bills in the case, it won't close properly, because you do have to fold the bills in half, but I try not to have too many on me at once anyways, so it's not really a problem with me. I am able to carry 2 credit cards (or my credit card and ID should I need my ID - I still get ID'ed to buy alcohol, which is awesome) and my money also. The clasp, that holds the case together, will also attach to the back should you need to make a phone call or something, that way it's not getting in the way while you're trying to talk. The case also came with a carrying strap, which attaches to the case by a lobster claw, and it's a lime green that matches the clasp and the inside of the case!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Perfect fit for my iPhone 6+ and Apple Watch. Apple Watch charger fits exactly and with no fuss and iPhone is more than secure. I completely recommend 100% buying this if you are in the market for an Apple Watch stand.
"Nice protection, not bulky, and with a stand-up strut, too."
Very good product. Perfect fit.
"My friend love it, wish would got a different color than black.... too much with the deliver charge tho..."
Bought these for my wife and they are huge in her ears. She tried a few of the replacement buds but still felt huge and clunky in her ears. Wife is 5ft tall and petite. For me they seemed fine. Then again I am a very all and big guy.<br /><br />Other than that they look sleek and nice can't speak to the quality or performance as we did not pair it. Going to return this today.
"This is the best case!!  It beats the otterbox case that I had, by far.  Very happy with product and delivery!!"
The product comes with two cables and one samsung wall plug charger. Out of the two cables that it came with only one works for me. The other one does not even register when you try to use it.
Cover didn't fit the phone there are different mototolla phones mine is a droid maxx which this cover was to small
Just exactly what I needed.  So glad I could find this cell phone holder.
"I really like this case, it fit perfectly and everything lined up exactly. I think it should do a nice job protecting my phone."
Great case to protect the Ipad. Could have been perfect if it had magnetic holder/ clasp built into the cover.
"I installed the replacement parts as instructed but once I turned on the screen, I noticed that the color looked washed out and that the phone's temperature monitor no longer worked. For me, these were minor inconveniences that I could live with since this is not a genuine Samsung replacement part, but rather one designed and produced by a third party. You can tell because the word &#34;Samsung&#34; is covered by tape when you get the replacement unit and there are minor differences in terms of the size of the home button, top speaker, etc. between the original Samsung and this unit. It worked like this until a few days ago when the home button and the back button ceased functioning and the screen would turn on randomly by itself. This started happening less than a month after I installed the replacement unit. I have also called the company several times and they have never picked up the call. Every time I am put on hold for several minutes until I just gave up and tried calling back later to no avail. I suggest STEERING CLEAR of this product and buying a cheaper cellphone to tide you over until you can get your cellphone replaced/upgraded.  This is not a cheap replacement and I wish I would have used the money to buy a cheaper cellphone rather than buying this unit to fix my screen."
I love it. There was a little difficulty adjusting the ban but that was because I didn't look at the instruction illustration. Once I did it was easy to figure and install. Locking the clasp can be a little tricky. You have to make sure the first part is hooked and snaps in properly before the second clasp will lock in place. Once you get the hang of doing it there's no problem.  Definitely gives the Apple Watch a much classier look than the rubber sports band without having to pay the higher price for the mesh style.
"I was hesitant to order this case due to the multiple layers in the photos.  Because of the bending issue, I wanted a solid case for my iphone 6 plus. I also needed a holster case. With this phone, I don't think anyone has pockets big enough... Delivered on time as promised with Prime.  The stylus is a nice extra but not really needed or used on my part. I have had no problems getting the case in and out of the holster and I also have a screen protector on as well.  The corners are all protected and there is a lip which provides protection for the screen.  All buttons work well and all ports are accessible.  No problems with charging or camera /photos. Excellent value for this purchase.  Would buy again and am thinking of buying an extra because the holster clips eventually break at some point."
beautiful!
"Most useful and practical mobile phone mount for a vehicle that I have ever owned. It can be easily moved to different vehicles if the vent mount is used, as opposed to the dash mount. The phone is kept cool by the vent. The phone can easily be placed in a good viewing angle when using maps for travels. The magnet that sticks to the back of the phone is not at all troublesome when the phone is not on the mount. To me it is on the expensive side, but it should be useful for all future phones. All it takes to move the magnet to another phone is replace the two-way tape. A kit is available, but I'll simply use good two-sided tape to mount it again. Such a simple mounting system is overdue!!"
"Poor quality. It looks cheap, and it is. Also, it does not have a magnetic lock. I didn't realize it before I bought it."
"This is the perfect size for my Samsung Note 4 - It slips into one of the front compartments under the Velcro-fastened front flap.  It's very lightweight but sturdy ripstop nylon material that already sheds water unless it's pouring.  It'll be even better when I spray it with water proofing.  The front slot is a good size for cards such as Driver's license and credit cards.  The zippered compartment is a decent size for a shorter pen, a notebook, coin purse, flash drives, candy, whatever you want  The loop for the belt is double stitched and will accommodate larger belts.  I especially like the extra slot in the belt loop for a carabiner (a small one is in it) and use that most of the time.  It does flop around if I walk fast, but if I put it on a belt, that wouldn't happen.  I received just the right amount of info from the company and it arrived well packaged and earlier than expected.  I've had such a hard time finding anything to carry my Note 4 in that isn't heavy leather and black or brown, this was an especially perfect find.  Mine is a shade more navy than the photo here, but I like that."
"I was nervous about purchasing this item because of other reviews...but it's the best case I've ever had, and I've had a lot of iPhone cases. The buttons in particular are fantastic. It's like not having a case at all in terms of &#34;tactile feedback.&#34; I can't comment on the size of the holes with headphones etc compatibility since I use Bluetooth for everything, but my charger fits great, and I have no problems with reception.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that the buttons for volume have a piece of tape to hold them in place. That's fine, but the tape overlaps the edge a bit so that you can press the side of the case below the buttons and make the volume adjust. I trimmed the tape shorter and problem solved."
Bought this item for my son off of his Amazon Wish List and he was very happy with the product when he received it .
Went to Europe over the summer and this case was perfect!!! Held up extremely well and I was gone for 6 weeks. Recommend if u are traveling.
"ok, but not great.  Doesn't last very long."
Decent looking case. Biggest issue is that the headphone jack cut-out is a bit too small. Fits fine otherwise.
"I really like this case. Originally when I first ordered it, I was simply buying a case just to protect my phone. But now I'm super happy with it because not only does it protect my phone, but it also looks really cool, and doesn't make my phone bulky like other cases. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it; people think it's one of those &#34;life proof&#34; cases. Also, I like the the little stand that's built in to the back of the case. I recommend this product."
"With four young boys, my phone gets dropped more often than I'd like. This case is fantastic and has protected my phone perfectly."
I've now purchased this case twice. I love how it sparkles. I've received many complements over it. My phone fits snugly in the case and I don't have to worry about it falling out. While you cannot fit a lot of cards in you can fit about six comfortably. As I don't like to carry very many cards I find it perfect.
worked fine little while then after 5 months my phone stopped charging the battery then started getting the gray battery of death put back in the oem battery went away.  The phone simply stopped recognizing the battery   (Update july 5th 2016) they sent me a replacement battery same thing happened all over again phone will recognize the oem battery but not the Rav power battery
The person I got it for loved it.  Thank you once again for great service.
I wish you would hold the battery a lot longer but it does give you the strength that you need
"Just for the record, I am a HAM, I have 2 other UV-5R radios, there was no user error involved in this product.<br /><br />Out of the box this radio had no RX audio. The speaker works, cause I could hear the Chinese woman yelling at me, but there was exactly ZERO receive audio, even in simplex. Also, the transmit signal was weak with low audio, and would not hold a repeater what I had line of sight with (the 97 machine located in Paxton MA). Additionally, the antenna and radio began to overheat with probably 3 min of light use, while monitoring on another UV-5R.<br /><br />Bottom line: The radio I received was a total dud. Will re-review if this can be returned and replaced w/o issue."
"I've had a few Trident cases as I've changed phones along with purchasing ones for my husband.  They are all fantastic.  I've had many cases from the phone carrier store made by different companies that break when dropped or aren't secure.  These are ALWAYS secure, and I have never had an issue with it not protecting my phone when I drop it (or even if I get liquid on it too.)  The rubber with the hard plastic is a great design and very protective.  It's clearly made for people like me who drop their phone all the time because I'm klutzy.  The prices are always very reasonable, which is a plus.<br />It definitely adds some bulk to your phone, but does it in a way that makes you feel like you could throw it against the wall and it would be secure. (Don't do this though.)"
"Good soft/hard case. This case has 2 layers, one semi-hard rubber case and on top of that a hard plastic case. It has a very sleek design and provides good protection.  I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
"I received my case and it goes on real easy.  I was disappointed in the color as it was no where close to light pink.  It is close to a neon pink.  Also, it add considerable bulk and weight to my phone which I don't like.  I like the kickstand and the wallet feature is a nice bonus.  Still looking for what I want, but will probably not be looking on line since colors don't appear to be true."
"It fit just fine but the plastic is hard and not really absorbent for impacts and made a tough fight to get it on the phone, ended up throwing it away after never using it and loosing the phone it was meant for into a lake."
"I have a iPhone 5s , and this is working great.<br />it small and fits in my pocket . really solved a huge problem for me , my phone was always dead by the late afternoon . this thing will charge your phone and still have power left.<br /> Love it"
It's fun and arrived fast. The only thing bad is that the fish eye lens is all blurred except for its very center. I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.
I bought it for my new phone Moto G G3. It seems like a cheep case and the worst thing is that it doesn't fit to my phone perfectly in the bottom side. I don't recommend it.
"*Free Sample provided for review*<br /><br />I was provided a free sample to evaluate and rate the earbud. I have evaluated this over a week and determined its a pretty good set of bluetooth earbud.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easily supports two phones/devices with bluetooth.<br />Small and versatile<br />Very light<br />The earbuds fit perfectly in my ears.<br />Conversations were very clear<br />Voice control was clean.<br />The buttons on the dongle were very responsive and worked perfectly<br />the audio feedback (out of range, power con, connected) were provided<br /><br />Cons:<br />The dongle hangs by your chin - hard to ignore it, Rubs against your face if you turn your face.<br />The standby battery life was about 2 days<br />Use time was about 3 to 4 hours - long flights might require you to carry two.<br /><br />Its labelled as a sport earbud - not sure how that works - when you have an open USB charging port - sweat might seep in to the port and affect - haven't used it for exercise (worried the dongle will be bouncing too much)"
great design. instant performance boost over worn old chargers.  built in tech prevents overcharging damage to devices.  have not experienced any loss of charging with multiple devices connected 2 at a time. stays seated securely in car port without getting loose and holds charging cords good and tight .
"my camera sucks. even when i do screenshots and send an sms, the megapixels for just awful.<br />This phone doesn't do group texts. if i group two ppl together, i get separate chat logs for each reply i receive back.<br />There's also no quiet hours i can apply like my old windows phone."
"Very nice size, and it can charge my phone up to 3 times."
Really liked the durability of this product feels sturdy and strong.  But sound on speaker phone and direct talk was difficult.  No one could hear me. Complained that I sounded like I was in a cave.  Bought for Disney trip. Served it's purpose.
"String broke on a water ride.  Case is huge, but good to put phone with case on it and credit cards/ID when going to water park."
"This case for my Galaxy S3 is great. It is a hard case, but the material isn't so slick as to fall out of my hand. It protects all sides of the phone, but doesn't add much thickness to the overall size of the phone - this was really important to me. And all of the cutouts for the buttons and camera fit perfectly. This is a great case and the price made it even better!"
"This radio is a great starter for new hams, at a great price. The only reason its not getting five stars is because the antenna is poor- you will need to buy a better and longer one to go with the radio. Other than that, no complaints."
"The new port and jack were a major improvement. My port got to a point where I couldn't even charge my phone no matter how I fiddled with it, I couldn't get it to charge. I have a couple complaints for this product. Nothing too major but VERY annoying at the same time. First one is about the battery. When doing this kind of repair, it's kinda necessary to remove the battery to ensure proper seating of the dock. I was disappointed to see they didn't include new adhesive necessary for reinstalling a battery. I had to order some because a battery rattling around in a phone isn't normally a good thing. My second complaint is about the tools. The drivers are absolute s**t (The torx driver is fine), the teeth on the Phillips broke after 3 screws. This wasn't much of a problem for myself because I have a large selection of small tools (I would have used them in the first place if I wasn't too lazy to grab them) but I am putting myself in the shoes of a lesser equipped DIY'er. That, and a bunch of metal bits from the Phillips got all over the phone. Thankfully nothing shorted. If you want to go about doing this repair buy this, a set of drivers and some adhesive for your battery. I highly recommend you remove the battery when performing this installation<br />TL;DR: Just buy this for everything BUT the drivers. They SUCK."
"The band 42mm hold up clearly with my apple watch, this pc is a little larger than the apple watch band but it looks good and fit very well,and the package coming with a link remover if necessory . Let me first say that I do like this quite a bit despite my first experience. This is the second pc I bought to my father. Once you get it fitted, you will fall in love with the look, weight, and feel of this band. The material is strong and sturdy. The finish is beautiful and by no means flashy."
I returned this product because the case showed signs of wear after only a few weeks. The color began to wear on the corners.
"I got a pair of these because one of my friends recommended them. Compared to the 400$+ Beats Audio they are great! They are loud with little to no interference. I use them running, working out, and normal day-to-day activities!! I love these and for the price you can't beat them!"
"I do not have a smart phone.  I could not get this to sync with my wireless laptop.<br />I love the design, the fit and numbers, but if I can't sync to anything, it wasn't worth keeping."
"It's a nice case, was hoping it would be more protective on the top layer but it's not. I still like it though."
Fantastic! Great buy at a great price.
Great product. If you have any issues with the kit they provide excellent customer service & respond in a timely manner. I would recommend to everyone !!
"We bought them to use with our new RV we needed them for directions in backing up, and my husband and I use them with the headset to talk to each other when riding in the RV, he can not hear me talking to him so they help us to communicate as he is driving."
As described. Came in on time! Snugs well. Designed to hold maybe 3 cards but will be hard to pull them out. Over all... its a good buy!
"Very tight, even on a very small adult head. Sound quality is OK - not amazing."
"Came with screen protector, case, and stylus. Only wish the case didn't brake so easy by the volume button."
Cute but a pain to put on take off if you are heavy battery user.
works great as a replacement speaker! i needed one for my blown 98' Dodge ram front speaker. does the job just fine!
Condition was better than advertised but the phone will not update to current version of OS.  Will have to do some research as to why it's not on 5.0...I may just need to be hooked to a cpu and manually load.  Overall worth it for the price and condition. Would buy from again.
"I was hesitant to buy a new phone battery from Amazon after hearing how many people were disappointed with their purchases.  This thing works great so far, though - my old battery was dying halfway through the day with almost no usage, and now it's still at 40-60% at the end of the day.  I've had it for a week and so far so good.<br /><br />I have the S5 active, which I think it says not to use with this battery because the back cover doesn't seal as tightly as it should with this slightly thicker battery.  I couldn't notice a difference, it still seems to click into place all the way around, but I'm definitely not going to dunk it on purpose so I couldn't really say whether this compromises the waterproofing."
"not the same color as the one shown here.  Ours was more sea blue / blue teal.  Not a great picture, still in the packaging b/c we're sending it back."
I got this so I can navigate or talk on the phone hands-free using the speaker mode. I didn't find myself using it as much as I had hoped to. I wasn't comfortable with my phone strapped to the steering wheel. It does block my view of my speedometer which I didn't like. I went with another phone holder that attaches to the vent which works so much better.
I have purchased and used 3 Blu phones.  They all run out of phone memory even thought there is ample extra microsd space available.  onc either runs out there is nothing you can do to fix this problem.  You have to factory reset it and lose all your stuff.  On a weekly basis.  DO NOT GET BLU phones .. they are not working !!!
Great case. Fits good and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. Feels good in the hand and buttons are very responsive. No complaints about the case but where I've been sitting it down has wore some of the plastic to a white color but that's nothing major.
I love this case but the eyelet that the wrist strap hooks to is faulty. It easily comes loose which leads to the strap ripping the case.
"holds 3 cards max, comfortably two cards , have had it over 3 months so far and no issues of cards slipping, protects my phone and not slippery."
Works well with both phones and tabs. i Charge it every week and use it 5 times with my S5
This cable is fantastic. It snaps into the phone nice and tight. I notice that this cable also charges my phone much quicker than the factory cable.
Did not meet my expectations. Was expecting something totally different. Case already had several scratches when I received it.
the concept sounded good and i bought it based on the video review.  i have to say its not ideal for my car as i am constantly trying to adjust the tripod and vent.  i decided to buy another.  driving is more important than to be distracted with this.
Worked great but you can't use your phone in hand while it's charging because it has to lay flat on the surface. Good for overnight charging.
"I think this mount is better than those that has a simple grip rather than a hook with spring. [[ASIN:B00VFEE86C Car Mount, AVANTEK Universal Cell Phone Air Vent Car Mount Holder Cradle for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus / 5S / 5C / 4S, Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge / S4 / S3 / Note 4, Google Nexus 5/4, LG G4, Nokia, Xperia, Moto, HTC and More]] --something like this, pay attention to the way it clips to the air vent. Talking about this mount, once you fit the hook into air vent it will never fall off. Also it has additional supporting stand so you can attach larger devices without worrying it would fail and break your air vent blind. The red rubber is efficient but I don't like the color; I would prefer a dark / black one since it draws less attention."
"Fit perfectly.  I like the rubberized feel of the case.  It is not slippery, this is what I was looking for in a case."
Product just as advertised. Great merchant
"Bought this for my husband for his birthday this year and it appears to work okay.  The arm is a little flimsy and does loosen up sometimes which then makes the phone spin sideways and not sit up straight.  However, it can be adjusted and it will work fine.  Seems like it holds his phone well and easy to view and get it off the mount when in use.  I don't think he has used the charger yet since we have one, but it is nice to have an additional charger handy when needed."
"Awful!  Not really iPhone Apple product.  Cheap, light weight and barely work."
"Elegant, sturdy, protective, perfect size and good materials"
"Very disappointed, belt clip came off the first day, I was able to snap it back in place and then the pin came out of the clip the next day."
This is a great case! It doesn't add a lot of bulk and has room for a card and a little cash (I ditched the mirror). The only challenge is that it it slightly too big for the docking station I bought.
Great case but frame sort of narrows the screen width.
Very thin and flimsy case. Offers no protection. I ordered the mint green and received a dark blue case.
"I have used this now the last couple months and it has done VERY well for me.  I typically get about 2 full charges from it for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  The charging time for the unit itself seems a little long, but is worth the trade off.  I have even had a few occasions to use the flashlight feature which is much more handy than expected."
My granddaughter was excited to use th stylus' but highly disappointed when she found they had tears in end.  One was totally collapsed on end.  They are not useable.  Waste of money.
Super cute! A little big so it slides around a bit but not annoyingly so. Still love it!
I purchased this selfie stick for a scavenger hunt we were doing where we had to submit pics of each task. It was such a great idea and the product is very well designed and constructed by the company. This particular stick was adjustable so it fit each one of our team members phones even though they were all different sizes and brands. It came in a box with simple instructions to put the 2-3 parts together and even had suggestions for use. We had a fun time and it even inspired our competitors to go and buy a cheapo one. We also got a chance to use it on the our cruise to Mexico. There are lots of products out there and I have had one from another company but this has been the best of it's kind and I would recommend it to anyone.
Phone case created odd echoing noise. Used it or one week and the purchased a replacement from a brand I'm more familiar with.
"Netsun has a high quality cable that is hard to distinguish from the original Apple cable that came with my iPhone. While it doesn’t specifically state that it is “Apple MiFi Certified” like Belkin and other brands, I really cannot prove that it is not. The Netsun cable charges fine without any incompatibility messages and it syncs my iPhone just as fast as my Apple cable does. Both the USB and lightning connectors fit snug into their perspective ports, and the cable strains seem like they are durable and should last a long time. You cannot beat Netsun’s 100% Lifetime Satisfaction guarantee, a free replacement with no questions asked – sounds good to me, as long as I don’t have to pay to ship the original one back to China. Providing the cable passes authentication in iOS 9 which will be released in a few weeks, I would highly recommend purchasing Netsun’s cable.<br /><br />Netsun provided a free sample cable for this review."
My phone has a new life!
There is a ton of capacity. Charges other devices fast. Takes a long time to get the device charged due to the high capacity.
"I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This case fit my galaxy s6 perfectly. I like the design and the ability to hold your credit cards, etc. Perfect and convenient.  Overall this is a good case for hiding your credit cards and not having to carry along your wallet. Perfect invention.  I recommend galaxy s6 users to buy this case. Loved this case!"
"The iPod nano is pretty delicate so a case is almost a requirement. I'm somewhat conflicted on what rating to give. The case itself  is sturdy and feels solidly built but it doesn't hold the iPod very securely. You put the iPod in by sliding it to though the top but once in the case the iPod feels lose and can be easily pushed out the case (for example when plugging in headphones).<br /><br />I'm almost wondering if I got a defective model or if it's just the way it works , but there doesn't appear to be anything else wrong with it."
The screen protector works great.
"Fit perfectly, feels good."
"Works perfectly. It's been dunked in water, chewed on by a baby, and dropped on concrete just about every day. My phone is still in perfect shape. I will never buy another type of case!"
This &quot;Pocket charger&quot; is awesome it will charge my tablet fully in half the time it takes on the wall!
"I've had this product almost three months, only one of my four chargers works. I'm very disappointed. I thought I would be getting a quality product that would last me at least a year. The chords themselves last a few weeks a piece and I had to rotate them out. I use them on both my iPhone 5 and my iPad. However, when hey did work, I was pleased."
Range is low. We went to a park with a lot of shrubs and trees on 3 bikes and I completely lost the other riders on the trail in less than a mile.
The phone case came in bent on the side.<br />It never went back to the previous shape and it got dirty quickly.<br />I would not recommend this to anyone.
"Pros:<br />Vent clip is pretty strong, doesn't move at all once installed.<br />Choice of how to mount the magnet<br />Fully adjustable.<br />Cons:<br />Depending on you're case, you may have some trouble. I have an Otterbox on my HTC One, which has a plastic case over a silicon case. if I put the magnet on the inside next to the phone, there was too much distance between the 2 for it to hold firmly. However,m there was a small circular tab on the plastic part of the case. I trimmed it down, and the magnet fit fine.<br />The ball joint isn't really that strong. My phone kept moving turning while I was in a curve. This was solved by *really* cranking down on the locking collar, but I'm not a tiny guy; my wife would never be able to put enough force on it to hold it in place.<br />Finally, the biggest problem; the magnet strength. My car isn't the smoothest riding car on the road, bu even *slight* bumps would case the phone to move a little. After a while, the phone would either turn sideways/upside down, or just fall off. It was &#34;ok&#34; on the highway, but on ramps and smaller roads were almost unusable. To be fair, my phone's kind of heavy. With case, my phone is about 225-230 grams. My wife's Galaxy S6 stays fine (Same issue with the case, however), and it weighs about 180 grams. I'd estimate anything over 200 grams would be a problem.<br /><br />My seem like a pretty negative review, but if you're phone is light enough/case thin enough, and you can tighten the collar enough, I'm sure it would be just fine.<br /><br />*Side note* might be unrelated, but my phone acted weird with the magnet under the case. Screen would turn off if the phone moved while it was attached, the screen would bug out occasionally: it looked like the resolution dropped severely, and the colors change. Never did it before, and only did it once after I removed the magnet. Might be nothing, but bears mentioning."
This is not compatible with the edge. I made that mistake. But the quality of the product was nice.
"Well this item that I purchased is not what I expected it to be. This phone does not charge at all,none what so ever. Really disappointed. Need an address to return please"
Great product
This thing is amazing ! Covers my iPhone 6 plus easily but with out a case on my phone. Able to take pics and videos with this case on and hear my music perfectly when I bring it in the shower
These headphones worked for a total of 3 minutes before they only had audio coming out of 1 side. Looked for a solution online but couldn't find anything
"A little bulky, but good value."
"Had it four months now, not a bad case for the money. Oil and dirt get ground into the back plate and make subtle but permanent stains. Case is durable, protects the NOTE 4 well. Holes, speakers, stylus, camera, and buttons all line up well. Fits the international version of the phone like a glove!"
"Broke after a year. The protection to the outer rim is near to nothing. My wife dropped the phone onto ground. The upper-right corner hit the ground first, there is literally no protection/cushion and the screen cracked.<br /><br />Cheap cover only provide the mere basic protection against daily worn. In case of dropping your phone, don't count on it."
Great deal and fast shipping. Phone was indeed in near perfect condition as described. erything works great. Was able to easily use with straight talk service provider. Totally happy with this purchase. Would recommend seller highly!
When we received the product it was cracked and we had to send it back for a refund.  We then purchased a screen protector from Verizon!
"I rate this a 3 Stars since the price is quite high for a product of its kind and category.<br />Similar cover can be bought in stores like, TJ Maxx or Ross at about half the price."
I ordered this for my Garmin Fenix 3 and it fits perfectly with zero issues!!!!  The order was processed right away and it arrived in Afghanistan within seven days of being purchased.  The application was simple and applied with zero complications.  Being deployed in a combat zone requires additional stress on your body and equipment.  My watch is subjected to continual abuse and this film is a life saver.  Thank you for the wonderful product and the fact it is made in the USA is an additional bonus.
"Easy installation, no bubbles after placing on the screen. This is not my first IntelliArmor screen, so I had experience installing the product on an IPad. The screen covers the glass, but there is about 1/32 of an inch all the way around the phone glass not covered. If you use a case, the sides of the case will cover the glass not protected by the screen. Overall the product and customer service will keep me coming back."
I am really starting to like the Caseguru cases. This one is no different. This is a new way to add a credit card holder to a phone case and I like this format. The card is tucked in and protected and I think it is harder for people to realize there is a card in there which could be good. This is a nice protective case. The case also fits nice with the &#34;edge&#34; feature on my phone. Looking for a good fit on the edges is something I really watch for on cases now.<br /><br />Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
Great screen protector but was confused about how to install.  Had to you tube an instructional video.  Otherwise it works perfect.
"I purchased 3 packs of 4 due to the high buyer ratings.  I have 3 iPhone 5 devices and an iPad mini 3 that use these.  We have many of these placed around the house, in cars or that I take with me when I travel.  They all work...sort of.  Our devices tell at times that the &#34;accessory may not be supported&#34;.  When this happens the device will not show as charging.  We sometimes have to unplug and replug the cord back into the device numerous times to finally get the device to accept the cord and charge.  GREAT PRICE, but I wish I didn't have to deal with the &#34;error&#34; messages."
"The product is really cute and I like it, but I can't use because I can't find a bumber case that will fit around my phone and between the case correctly.<br />😕"
The packaging on this phone case was amazing.  The phone case is excellent smooth easy to grip fits the phone perfectly. All the holes are in the right spots nothing covers important spots that are vital to smartphone use. Have no fear if you order this it will be protected from the best packaging I've seen on a phone case delivered from amazon save the expensive otterboxes. This case is amazing and will protect from minor falls. Loving it so far. I received this item for free for a honest review.
"Good cheap phone, it is what it is."
Battery life is much less than expected.<br />Sounds great regardless of the kind of music<br />Effective @ blocking outside sounds
"I love the way that I can easily dial up a number and call without even using my hands. Device is very well designed and overall i'm pretty happy with it, if we also add the part that I got it for free so I could see if it was actually worth to buy. For me, it's a total must have"
"purchased for my husband, a general contractor, to use on the job site.  The product is perfect for his needs.....protecting his Ipad."
"Not sure if I wanted a wallet type case, but after using it, it is the right choice.  Good protection for phone, feels great in hand and looks great.<br />Still have to open it to receive a call, but then can close it and keep talking.  Also works well in car with voice recognition."
Great case for the price... I used it for about 6 months and have now purchased other designs... I like to accessorize and this was nice! CUTE and worked great for protection. I only changed because of style... I think this case would last more than a year.
Good dependable case for the price ..hard to put on at first ...protection is good  not too bulky like some others my teenage girls love their cases
"OK, what a great surprise. It's been about a week and this new battery, when fully charged lasts for over 48 hours. (ex. fully charged Friday morning (8 am), now it is Sunday (8 am) and battery is at 37%). I am not a heavy user. I send and receive texts (6 - 12 daily), check Facebook (3 - 4 daily), use camera (1 - 3 daily), and check e-mail (1 - 2 daily). Plus, the battery charger keeps my old battery charged as an emergency backup. All this for under $20...WOW"
Ordered this for my husbands birthday. Arrived quickly and the quality is great!
"This leveling system worked well for leveling 12x24&#34; and 12&#34; square stone tiles.  I recommend a little thinker mortar bed to give them room to self-level.  I used a 3/8&#34; square notched.  Also, try to keep a 'wet edge' when tiling. They won't level well if one of the tiles is nearly dry and the one you just set down is wet.  Squeeze the tightening tool slowly and hold a second or two for best results.  Squeezing it quickly will break the strap.  Back troweling all tiles is a must."
It flows enough amperage to properly charge our tablets & smart phones.
This is a great case. It's reliable and rugged enough to withstand my abuse.  If you do have any trouble they (iBattz) provides excellent support for their product. I hightly recommend their products and would buy again.
I recommend watching a YouTube video on how to glue all the components onto the new replacement screen prior to buying this product.  I wish I would have spent the additional money to buy the iphone screen with digitizer included.
Brought this to 6 flags with my family and took the best selfie roller coaster rides ever. It's awesome.
This case is exactly what I wanted. It's just a black TPU case that covers the corners and back. It has all the necessary cutouts and it makes the phone a lot less slippery
"Just got them. Already love em. Very comfortable, easy to use controls, great volume!!! 25-30 foot range before bluetooth starts to cut out. Really good sound quality. Buds fit nicely and stay placed securely in ear. I would recommend these to anybody. Great product for the price"
After using this charger for a couple of weeks I noticed that it started to disconnect from the phone and then reconnect.  Over and over again driving me crazy!
" I love that I can recharge the charger just by being outside. I can use it to fully charge my battery, clip it back to my bag and then forget about it until my next charge is needed."
"I bit the bullet and bought myself a selfie stick. This is a great stick, easy to use and sturdy construction."
"This is the worst phone from Motorola (lenovo)<br />As everything that lenovo touches now Motorola devices are suffering from the bad decisions of the lenovo people.only had 1 lenovo pc and it was a nightmare and now this stupid phone wich is a Moto E with a bigger screen.<br />i owned the 1st and 2nd gen Moto G and they are pretty good phones But this 3rd gen is a joke,<br />This Phones are not directly from motorola if you can search the phone files you will find this phones are from consumer cellular,no wonder why mine came with the box opened,maybe mine was a return.for my surprise this phone came with some personal files hidden maybe from previuos owner and amqazon are selling them as new!!! new?????? may be not!!<br />Slugish and filled with stupid bloatware,battery duration is really bad especially when using 4g lte is like a V12 drinking gas!!!!<br />IN MY CASE MINE OVERHEATS JUST IN 3 MINUTES TO THE POINT IM NOT ABLE TO HAVE IT NEAR MY FACE,SIMPLY NOT SAFE !!!<br />AND WHEN HOT IT WILL NOT CHARGE THE BATTERY.<br />I WANT MY MONEY BACK THIS PHONE IS PLAGED WITH PROBLEMS.<br />THANKS LENOVO FOR RUINING MOTOROLA REPUTATION!!!!"
"Used it with my Galaxy S5.  Great for taking pictures.  Could not get it to pause/record video.  After starting video recording manually, it would only stop recording"
These are beautiful. The only reason why I rated it a four was because it shipped extremely late. Was told they got lost. Good quality.
Great
"Love the product. Liked the first one so much that I purchased 2 more in different colors. This is a high quality product, and definitely worth the price. The only problem is there is a place for a wrist strap but one was not included, other than that great product."
Case doesn't fit phone to where you can't use volume key when case is on. Otherwise the case is functional.
"The case itself fits the phone well, and it looks very nice. It does feel as nice as the commuter series and doesn't have plugs over the headphone jack or the charging port, but besides that the case works very well, and feels good in my hands... also I do enjoy the single layer aspect, and the phone goes in easily and out as well... when I am looking to buy another phone case I will probably still get a commuter over this style, but this is a very good alternative to that"
I made fun of people with selfie sticks until I needed one for our 2 week European vacation. It was awesome! And this stick is super nice with the Bluetooth connection. The battery lasts a really long time and charges quickly. Highly recommend!
Two<br /> BIG AN  BULKY got something  else instead
"Nice quality, offers decent protection, not too bulky.  Biggest reservation is the screen protector makes it vey difficult to swipe up to access control panel, and overlay on button is somewhat annoying."
"Great case, I get the protection I want all while not having an over size bulky phone case. One bad thing is that other otterbox came with a screen protector and this one did not. Over all still a great case."
"This is the third case I am using by New Trent. I received my second case and this case as a tester for New Trent. I did not pay for them but I do run them as I paid with my hard earned money.<br /><br />From the packaging to the materials used to the way it fits, quality of this case can be seen and felt.<br /><br />User manual/installation guide is at the back of the box. If you give the back of the box a look before you start installing, you might save your self some time and frustration. It is not easy to separate the two parts of the case unless you read or figure out to &#34;peal&#34; it. Best spot to start to peal is bottom of the case. Once you get the bottom part pealed, it is really easy to peal the rest. Case's flexibility makes it easy to separate. You might want to take the &#34;interchangeable back cover&#34; off and open all &#34;plug covers&#34; before starting to peal.<br /><br />Make sure to remove the blue film on the front and the back of the inner case and clean the screen of the phone before you close the case. It is a little harder to take the separate cover when the phone is inside as it becomes structurally rigid.<br /><br />Case fits very snug and feels very secure on the phone. Outer shell is a soft and flexible plastic that feels comfortable in the hand. It has a slip resistant surface which provides extra grip. Inner/screen cover is better than most screen protectors I have used. Screen is still very responsive and sensitive. Stylus pens work perfectly fine with this case.<br /><br />All enclosed buttons function very well. Home button cover does not interfere with the normal functioning or finger print sensor. Plug covers close nice and tight. The openings for the rear camera and flash, front camera, receiver as well as the light sensor have a protective film. Bottom microphone and speaker have perforated openings. All openings are nicely located and sized so they do not affect the usage, audio and video quality.<br /><br />Interchangeable back covers are an added bonus. They are painted plastic however, they are thick enough to be sturdy. They can be changed easily without the need to take the case off. Only problem I had is; the top right clasp of the black interchangeable cover broke before I even try taking it off. However, it still holds very tight without any problem.<br /><br />One other point I realized is; this case for iPhone 6 does not bulk the phone as much as the 5S version. Nevertheless, it feels as durable and protective.<br /><br />I believe this case is a very strong contender in the &#34;heavy duty&#34; category. The quality and protection offered for the price is higher than any competitor. It is 3 in 1 solution for less than the price of 1. Think about the design and construction of your iPhone that you like so much and imagine that in a case."
"Received promptly. Easy upgrade of maps on computer. Works well. Has several features not on my older Garmen. One nice one is that it doesn't &#34;recalculating&#34; when you miss a turn or exit off for gas. It simply states how to get back to route. Not sure about the traffic feature. The first time it said anything was after about 1000 miles and it suddenly said that &#34;traffic was flowing good&#34;, but I was coming upon a bunch of traffic that was backed up to a stop for some unknown reason. It didn't say anything about some other construction slow downs I encountered, so I'm not sold too much on the traffic feature. My older unit would show the traffic problems out lined on road. Over all it was a good purchase for me."
"works well!!  I have noticed however as other's have said that from time to time the battery gets pretty hot.  I would say like once every couple weeks it's that way.  Not really sure if it's because of the way I place it on there, or a software issue, or what.  I guess you could always take it off the darn charger though after a couple hours to prevent this if you were competent enough, and the xperia lasts about 2 days on a charge anyhow!"
"Worked great in my Yukon.  Just the right length and had the suction cup fairly low on the windshield.  A bit of a tight fit with my Galaxy S5 in it's Otter Box case, but worked.  Was able to use Google Maps navigation on a recent 900 mile trip - no issues.  Positioned it on the dash to my right.  Glad they made this longer neck version."
"I purchase and received fast. I has been on my phone for 3.5 months, I have been very satisfied with the protection of my phone and product. I recommend their product."
Amazing sound for the price and size.  I have Sonos speakers throughout my house and this little guy rivals that sound quality.  No brainier for the price.
Use it for almost 1 year every day and it's steel like new not even dirty (some cases get dirty in a week)
"Plantronics CS530 Office Wireless Headset with Extended Microphone & Handset Lifter<br /><br />Worth every penny.  If you work at a desk and talk on the phone often, this is a must have.  Once you use it you will never want to talk on the phone without it. The earpiece is very comfortable and the sound clarity is amazing-both what you hear and what you say. Setup is quick and easy.  I can dial into a conference call, walk to the company cafeteria 200 feet away and still be part of the call."
"Delivers as advertised.  Actually stayed dry inside when tested in a bucket outdoors for 24 hours.  I would buy again, gift it and recommend it.  Wish I had seen it before I bought an expensive Otterbox Preserver which doesn't float and needs a bag like this to save it."
"This portable charger is probably one of the best that I've ever had. In addition to its fast charging, it is also very user friendly. When you charge up the product, the battery power lights up to show you how much it's charged at. The weight seems kind of off for the size of the product, but it's overall a great product!"
"I got the space grey watch band, really wanted to like it since it looks and feels great. However, just after a few weeks of light use I see scuffs which expose the real color of the material (silver), it looks horrible. Not sure if I got a defective one or if this is a problem with iVAPO watch bands in space gray."
"*I received this product at no cost to write an unbiased review*<br /><br />This cable is extremely sturdy. The cable has great weight to it and seems like its reinforced very well. From my experience, cables tend to break most often at the joints and with this cable it seems like it'll be a long time before I have to worry about that. This cord is 6ft long and I thought it was a nice touch to include some velcro cable ties. I use a 10ft cable at home and sometimes it's too long, so it's nice to be able to wrap it up. Definitely recommend this cable and just about anything else from Anker!"
"I needed some extra wall chargers for the house ( one for the bedroom, and one for the kitchen ) for our iphones and  and found this 2 pack.  I purchased them and have been very pleased. To charge my iphone4 it took about 2 hours to get at 50%, which I was very pleased. Although not purchased to charge my ipad, I wanted to see how it did and it took about 3 1/2 hours to get an additional 30% charge. Again, it was purchased mainly for our iphones and am very pleased. Although this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review I would recommend it at the listed price for its quality."
"This is exactly what I was looking for!  Excellent quality, color, and features. I love it! It fits my 6 plus and my slim tech 21 case literally perfectly.  Buy this product now! Thank you for making such a great product at a perfect price!"
Charges well most of the time. Sometimes you need to hit the button to make it start charging devices again
"Even though the description for these cases are for the correct model phone, they do NOT fit at all!!! I can no longer return them for different cases since its past the 30 days. Bought them when I was out of state caring for ill sister! So now that I am back, I am stuck with two cases that I bought my kids that DO NOT FIT!!! Thanks Amazon!"
"I had a Magellan Maestro before and i was very satisfied, the 5230T road mate is cumbersome to operate, you have to hit many buttons to get to different options my son has a Garmin Nuvi and that is very easy to operate. Knowing what I know know I would not have bought the Magellan RoadNate"
This case did not last very long.  Couple months then it cracked. Good thing it wasn't expensive.
When you have kids that love to play with your cellphone you always have to try to protect your cellphone. My daughter grab my cell phone and slammed it against a weight I didn't check it i thought that she didn't hit it hard. Later on the day I received a phone call when I grab my phone I see that my screen is completely broken. I cost me so much money to replace the screen. I know is impossible to keep the cell phone from my kids so the best thing to do is find a protection for my phone. This screen protector is the best thing I could of spend my money on. It protects my screen from hard hits and from scratches. I love that when I have make phone calls my make up doesn't stay on the screen like with other screen protectors. I really do recommend having a screen protector. I received this item at a discount price in exchange for a honest review.
Connection to phone gets spotty then unreliable after 3 weeks.  The elastic cord makes this super frustrating to use.  Worthless for me.
I've had these headphones for about a month.  They are very comfortably padded around the ears and at the top of the head.  The noise cancelling feature works very well whether using it at home (to concentrate) or on a jet.  The sound quality is great.  It is an exceptional value for the price and I would definitely recommend buying them.
The case feels better that my life proof. It has a headphone port that doesn't have to be unscrewed which is nice.  It's solid and feels like it will provide better screen protection.  Please check your silent switch before applying the super human strength to snap it together!!! I didn't! I had to take it apart and redo it. I had a slight issue with my first one. No biggie but customer service immediately sent a new one out as well as an apology. Great customer service! There are no rubbery parts on this like there was on the life proof. My life proof rubber area around the screen snagged and peeled off in 3 months! I did test this case and it did not leak! The overall look and feel is superior to my life proof. I love it! I will purchase more for my family
Only used it twice there's my star rating so far will give it more time an see how we do but so far we are good
The quality of the case is nice. Looks great. This DOES FIT BALISTIC NYLON version. The product description does state this. The 2 star is based on this fact.
Doesn't even deserve ONE star!!!!<br />Never been dropped and not even a week of having it the plastic that holds my phone is cracking. 3 corners are cracked.
VERY DISAPPOINTED in the purchase of this product. I bought 2 of these chargers. well after use of 1 day the 1st charger stopped working and would not charge my phone anymore! Then the 2nd charger melted while my fianc&eacute; was charging his phone at work (the cord and wall adapter).
"The Levin CooTube 5000mAh USB power bank is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is equipped with PowerIQ smart technology that adjusts power output to fit the requirements of various mobile devices to be charged. It also includes a flashlight.<br />Like many such devices,  it has 4 blue LED (status of charge) that indicate the charging and discharging process. It has enough juice to fully charge an iPhone 6 Plus twice, or an iPhone and an iPad. It has all the expected safety certifications.<br /><br />The ergonomic tubular shape with octagonal sides makes it easy to handle and remain stable when placed on a flat surface. Made of strong Ultra light aluminum, its small size - 1.25” x 4” and weighing 4.85 oz - make is very portable and easy to carry in a pocket, purse, attache etc.<br /><br />The package includes the power bank, a USB/micro USB cable and a user manual. Operation is simple and intuitive. To activate press ON/OFF button once; to turn on flashlight press and hold for 3 seconds; do the same to turn it off.<br />I really like it and shall keep it in my car’s glove compartment for possible emergencies.<br /><br />I received a free coupon for a complimentary sample provided for testing & evaluation. It did not influence my opinion or rating. I have no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees."
"I will not pay the money again for this case, one week after having the case my phone dropped and broke the screen. When I called life proof all they said was there was a 3% chance that could happen. That was the reason I bought the case!"
"Love my case! If you want the protection of a brand name otterbox with a beautiful design, you've got the perfect case &#60;3"
Great price. No issues with this battery.  I've had it for a month now
Fell apart fast. Only had it for a couple months of that and the purple already started pilling off.
I like the idea of having battery pack & 12 volt power option. Buck the range SUCKS!!!! 25 ft is all I get
"My experience with my Up24 changed my life - which is probably why I had such high expectations for Up2.<br /><br />The band is not as good as Up24. While  black and silver colour choices are more subtle, I loved my persimon Up24.<br /><br />Up2's design is sturdier and the one size fits all is a better idea. However I have found the band to be unreliable, from switching to sleep and stopwatch mode if my clothes or watch touch it, to unresponsive, making me need to get into the App to switch modes.<br /><br />The new App is still great but small changes haven't improved the UX. For instance the visual representation of my sleep patterns is not as easy to follow and the layout of my progress and coaching tips has changed to be less user friendly.<br /><br />That said I like the App's connectivity with other apps which grows all the time.<br /><br />All in all given my experience with Up24, I feel that sadly Up2 is not a step forward."
"We have had this item<br />For 35 days. Today was the first time we opened it to use it, the pin pulled completely out unable to use this product. 30 day window for return has passed. Unable to return. Appears to me cheaply made."
omg this product is beyond my expectation thank you for the seller i'm so love it
Product says it's for iOS but there's no app in the app store.  In order to send back you have to pay postage...to CHINA!<br /><br />So....no point in sending it back.
The pen does not work on LG it did not respond to the touch and then the side clip fell off within minutes.  The magnet does not hold if u have more than 4 cards in the slots. Pretty design but not successful design or quality of touch pen.
"For me it's about my phone case as it is about my handbags. I like having them in many colors and styles and I like changing them as often as I do my handbags.  I want to make sure that I protect my smartphone even when not using the bulkier boxes.<br /><br />The EVO21 Slim iPhone 6 Case is stylish and attractive and I love the unique Aztec design on the back of this phone case. This phone case has a raised diamond pattern around the ridge and makes for an added protective grip so that you don't drop it as easily.<br /><br />The air cushion bumper corner protects it from minor damage which are caused by jarring and bumping by accident, and also helps your cell phone by absorbing some of the shock when dropped. The front of the case has raised edges so that when you do lay the phone down or slip it into your pocket or the pocket on your purse, it helps to protect the front of your phone from scratches.<br /><br />The stylish Aztec artwork that is printed on the back of the phone has been done in the best quality inks, and it has been protected from scratches by lamination for added care from minor scratches. This cover has all the right cut outs for your input of jacks, free camera lens for clear pictures, and all the other ports stay clear.<br /><br />There are several colors to choose from and you too are going to love this cell phone cover. It gives great protection without all the bulk of a lot of those cell phone boxes. Enjoy!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and is based solely on my experience with the product."
"Needs improvement. Steps are inaccurate. The sleep function should be automatic. I am disappointed because I love the first Jawbone, now its discontinued. Update: I am on band # 3. The steps remain inaccurate, even with their firmware update. The sleep function is now automatic. I would not waste my money again on this. Buy a FitBit."
Submitted a review for this one already! It'seems a Winner!
"Although the title may bring you tears of glory compared to what the reviews may say, this was indeed no easy process. After my first order was happily lost via the hands of the USPS, this was gladly refunded. So I went ahead and ordered another one, low an behold this one actually made it, despite the advertised 2-day Amazon delivery for an item that showed up 3 days late, I was just happy to have the darn thing, as my alcantara wheel was looking terrible and falling apart. I open the neatly packaged wheel cover which was folded nicely in a clear ziplock type bag. Finally find the time to install this baby, WAIT...no string was to be found. Once again I get the customer service of a king, lets just say I had to go out and buy some string, oh and a needle which was never received either.<br /><br />Now for the install of actually placing this over and M3 wheel will take almost Hulk like strength and the gentleness of a mothers touch, which I have neither of. Got the thing to slip on at some crazy angle which was not easy trying to physically stretch the darn thing and take note where the stitching will go which connects the wheel to itself in the middle, I choose to try and get this stitch as close to the bottom centerline of the wheel as I could which was not easy of sucessful either. There will be any moments which you will come close to tearing the thing, but just be careful and take your time. Wow, this was a difficult feat in its own. Now for the threading, I opted to find the recommended thread which Amazon sells, but at my local JoAnns of course and cheaper. I doubled up the thread to to length of my arm extended and started from there. This was my first time sewing anything and was a bit if a task at first, but things went along much more quickly and easily as time went on. Total install was about 2 hours, split this install into four pieces, each side of the bottom, and split the top portion into 2 sections as well. Watch a Youtube video and you will get the hang of it no problem, just try to get the stitching as close/tight as possible, if you rip a thread just insert your thread directly into the leather itself, you'll get it....just do it. You'll be glad you spent the money and time as the wheel looks nice and feels great.e hang of it no problem, just try to get the stitching as close/tight as possible, if you rip a thread just insert your thread directly into the leather itself, you'll get it....just do it.

Fairly easy to apply. Decent privacy protection. Still hard to use in a bright sun like many other privacy screens.
"Born:  7/29/15<br />Died:  8//27/15<br />Cause of Death:  Poor craftsmanship<br /><br />Bought this because of all the &#34;4 and 5 star reviews&#34;.  At this point, it is worthless.  Does not charge anymore and the usb connection is loose.  Will definitely do Samsung OEM from now on.  All these third parties probably make the Sammy charger as well, but they are probably selling the ones that didn't pass inspection."
"Nice screen protector. Installation wasn't any more difficult than other screen protectors I've installed. The trick is to clean your screen very well and wash your hands prior to install. This comes with little dust stickers to help remove any stray dust particles that you notice prior to installing the screen protector. It went on smooth and any little bubbles disappeared with some smoothing on the screen. Fits the Note 5 perfectly.  Unlike some other tempered glass protectors, the edges lay nice and flat. I would recommend this one and would buy again."
"Product defective 2 weeks after shipment. Battery leaked in my phone. Tried charging, will not charge.<br /><br />Amazon, or Anker, please assist. I could not return before 30 day window because of travel. I received batteries 32 days ago, but one of them was defective after 2 weeks."
"connects with the phone fast. Power safe feature works very well, holds the charge well. Sounds quality from the speaker can be a bit better."
"I love this product so much that I took it with me on vacation to use in my rental car ( it is THAT easy to install ). Unfortunately I left it behind, so I had to buy another one because it is THAT useful :)"
"I really like it. I like the color. But it looks bit weak. When I tried to put it on my iphone, i almost broke it. Its hard to fit in. But still I like it."
"VERY HEAVY! Offers great protection, however, everything isn't covered, so I don't believe this is a very efficient waterproof case. I would submerge it if I were you."
Top button on  phone won't allow me to do a screenshot  .
"It was a little difficult to get onto the vents of my Scion since they are thick, but once it was on it worked well.  One hot day, my boyfriend removed it since it was covering a lot of the a/c vent.  That's when I found out that I couldn't get it back on.  The rubber had peeled away from the metal where it grips & it was then impossible to get back on the thick vents.<br /><br />So if you have thin vent slats and plan on leaving it in place, this should work well for you.  But it didn't work for me."
These protectors are soooo worth the money.  My daughter has broken many screens on her iPhone (she drops her phone way too much).  Since using these if anything breaks it's just the protector which can easily be replaced! She is much happier paying $8 than $60 for a new screen.
"Have tried both Go 50 and GO 60 units. Except for screen size seem the same. Several issues found:<br />-Sound level FAR, FAR too low....can't hear well with radio or AC on or passenger talking......REALLY disappointing....voice essentially worthless....probably designed by very young person who hasn't experienced hearing losses... yet.<br />-Day screen was totally invisible....noticed time was 12hours out of sync....indicating PM during AM....could not find how to correct time....eventually the time corrected....no idea how....and day screen brightness became acceptable at 100% setting.<br />-Unit needs a &#34;Repeat Instruction&#34; button to allow repeating voice instruction....instruction is given at low volume per above, and is gone before the radio/AC...or passenger..... can be turned down so you can hear the voice instruction. Road noise in y Jeep Cherokee, even with windows closed, makes voice worthless..<br />-Needs a &#34;Pause Route&#34; button so &#34;Samantha&#34; will shut up while I take a short side route....to get gas, see an interesting POI (maybe a gun shop...:)....then the original route can be resumed when I'm finished with my little detour......I don't always want to &#34;turn around as soon as possible&#34;<br />-Desperately needs User Voice Recognition to enter search info......the keyboard is too time consuming and impossible when driving alone<br />-User manual....over 100 pages////still leaves a lot to be desired. Not info on battery.....soldered in or replaceable....etc<br />-Actually bought the GO 60 for $37,00 at WalMart......pricing error????....then bought a second one.....so value is OK even with deficiencies. Not a good buy at $150 range,"
Its okay. Despite following the instructions to the letter I had trouble removing tiny air bubbles trapped under the film using both a pencil with the provided cleaning cloth.
"I put it on my cell phone following the instruction. It looks really cheap on my cell phone: the surface is not smooth and a gentle scratch by snail can leave a mark on it. The quality is as same as a 1$ screen protector from China. It's not 9H hardness (it's not even on the plastic bag, yes, plastic bag not box which might be stronger) as described in the Amazon page. Simply speaking, it's not the product in the video, nor the product introduced in the Amazon page. Do not waste your money on this. Some 1 dollar screen protector can do the same thing as this one."
"zero night vision, very poor image quality."
"Super fast delivery! The case fits snug so it's perfect! And I love the color! All around, I give this a 5 star rating :)"
"I've always been a fan of going case-less due to form factor. This case is different, protection without the bulk. The look and texture maintain the elegance of the phone. The hole for the camera has just enough depth that the lens is protected from everyday surfaces. Access to pen and ports are unobstructed. Random text on the case, i.e. &#34;megapixel&#34; and &#34;High Pro Shield&#34; is a bit of an eye sore but can be overlooked. Also the packaging was a bit excessive. Maybe save production cost and in turn save the customer money by switching to something more simple?"
"It doesn't make sense, only the back changes. Cheap looking."
"It does what it's supposed to do, (provides power to two devices at one time) except it adds some complications in the form of interfering with my car's radio.  I tried a few different configurations hoping to fix the problem, but the bottom line is that any time this 2-port charger is plugged into my car, my radio quality drops significantly (even while using satellite radio)."
Exactly as expected. Great product.
My travel cord. If it doesn't long I will write another review.
"I can get this thing to produce coordinates, but there are not good instructions available and it is not easy.  It is NOT for children:  I purchased it along with three others (other brands) for use with fifth graders and guess which one was always the last one chosen?"
"This mount is solid and secure.  It's a bit ugly, but it is super versatile in what it can carry.  I use it on my motorcycle with an iPhone 6 and Nexus 6."
I LOVE this case!!!!!! Oh my goodness the quality is awesome. Especially for it not even being expensive. Will be buying more.
"Within 2weeks I had to return due to broken door where you charge. Customer service at life proof was very good, they sent replacement right away. We will see how this one goes."
"Very disappointed. I have the latest ipad model and the case was half an inch too large for it. Looking at other reviews, maybe I was unlucky to receive a fautly case, but for me it was completely unusable."
I purchased this product for my hubby && he loves it!!!! He is a Dallas cowboys fan so this was a great case for him to have.
It has been a wonderful cover for two years but now the inside plastic frame has broken and it's causing problems.  The phone is still safe though!
"Like it alot but got a chip in mine by the front facing camera. Didnt hit it or anything, just chiped one day."
It does not stay in place while driving. It needs constant readjustments which sucks while doing Uber
"I do like the charging station but when I received it, it was much much bigger than I thought and bulky as well. It came with the adapater attached to the product and can be hidden inside at any time. It also has an on and off button in the back, When it is on, there's a blue light that shows, when it's off, there's no light at all. It allows you to charge up to 3 portable devices at one time. I wouldn't really say it organized like the picture shows because once you have all 3 devices charging, there are cords everywhere and it really becomes an eye sore. Also, all the slots are pretty much the same size. You can't adjust the sizing in case you want to charge a device a little bit bigger. Overall, this brand is pretty good. Only wish there was a way to hide all those charging cords so I used another port and just kind of hind the charging cords in the back of my computer desk. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and very pleased with it. I would definitely recommend it."
This case has a cool design and functions very well. The fit is snug and will protect your phone from a reasonable fall. The reason for the four stars is because it is hard to take off (for cleaning) and the carbon fiber is just an adhesive sticker that is placed on the back. It has fallen off after about a month of use from taking it in and out of my pockets. I have since switched back to another case that more fits my needs.
"the battery does not last as long as expected, and it should have a spring like hinge for the ear pieces."
"I bought this to use as a tablet only, so I can't comment on its abilities as a phone. But it is a very nice tablet, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a basic tablet at a reasonable price."
The little stand doesn't work very well -- the tab hangs over the screen -- and the case seems very chintzy.  Ah well ......
"exactly what i figured, pretty durable took a little bit longer than i thought but worth it"
USB ports are an excellent plus - making this more than your average converter.  Wasn't sure if I would need it during a business trip to Brazil but bought it at the suggestion of a colleague.  The USB ports are an excellent plus and despite what the hotel websites said about their outlets I couldn't have charged electronics at the hotel without it - it worked wonderfully.
"Great case, fits perfectly. Its white, so I was a little worried about it getting dirty easily, but I've had it for a couple months and no marks on it yet. It keeps my phone protected but also doesn't make the phone too bulky."
Do not make my mistake this does NOT fit Galaxy S4 Active
Good product....however when surfaced is scratched...the leather surface is peeled off...making it look cheap...
"Every think it's good about this hadphone, but sometimes it disconnecting and it's making noise that is annoying for the year"
"As I've noticed with cheaper screen protectors, they tend to leave a lot of bubbles behind since the screen is too sticky on one side and not the other. Didn't have a problem with these"
"This cable is advertised as &#34;the toughest cable on earth&#34;. After owning this cable for less than a month and using it less than a dozen times, the lighting connector ripped away from the cable shroud under lateral / shear force, rendering it useless. The fact the cable does not bend easily means that there is a strong lateral force induced on the lightning connector when the iDevice is moved while charging, putting a large strain on the connector.I think there's some more engineering work to do here to improve the design."
"Arrived promptly and in good shape.  The board works flawlessly with the Arduino Ethernet library (dont forget to make sure the baud rate select on your Serial monitor is correct and you understand how to define your local IP settings)<br />I selected this as an alternate board after 2 cheap-ies from overseas were malfunctioning and had to be returned after days of frustration.  Save yourself the time and effort, spend a bit more for this choice and just get on with your Arduino connectivity project!  (TIP- like any shield the pins can arrive slightly out of perfect alignment.  Flip your arduino around and use one cluster of the 8 female connectors to align the shield's pins in groups.  Then flip the shield around and try ease all of the pins into all the Arduino connectors)."
"great design, protect my Iphone very well, but it is too thick, all in all great product, i recommend it strongly."
Works as expected in charging up my cell phone and tablet.  Nice slick design Appears to hold a charge for a good bit of time.  Charges up well.
"[[ASIN:B00YOA3NEC iPhone 6 Armband Brand New Design By Bolt - #1 Highest Quality iPhone 6 Running Armband - Seamless, Breathable Mesh, Headphone Cord Holder - Sweat Resistant - Black - For Men & Women - Lifetime Guarantee]]<br /><br />I received this iphone 6 armband in only 2 days and put it to used right away.

I love this product."
"[[VIDEOID:83233901abea16f1ac1e413ef384c633]]This Saumsung Galaxy S6 Case by Collen is perfect for my phone.  This case has 2 parts.  The first part is the Impact resistant Silicone that covers the back and sides of the phone.  The second part is the hard plastic heavy duty cover that goes over the silicone.  The case is an attractive blue and compliments my phone nicely.  It also has a nice durable kickstand on it that allows my phone upright or on it's side.  This phone case is very nice and durable, it evens comes with a bonus tempered glass screen cover that was incredibly easy to install.  I would compare this case with any high priced case, but of course the cost of is so much cheaper and well worth it.  Who needs to spend money on an expensive case anymore?  Not me!  I am honored to leave my honest unbiased review for this item that I received as a promotion."
"Heavy duty casing similar to Otterbox but at fraction of the cost. The case comes in 2 parts that clips together encasing the phone. The casing is made of soft rubber that can absorb significant shocks when the phone is dropped. The front of the case comes with a built-in clear screen cover. It also comes with 3 color plates, Black, Gray, and Gold for the back."
It was awesome for the first few days now it doesn't work as good it's mostly static and I have to adjust it numerous times.
These work but they charge my iPad and iPhone very slowly! They are not defective but they only put out .5amps so charging takes longer.  Make sure to pay attention to charging amps.
"Seems to work great so far. Installation was not too bad. Try to follow the tips in the instructions and you should be fine.<br /><br />One thing to note, the curved design on the LG G4 actually seemed to help with this process. I used the &#34;hinge&#34; method and stickers, but I did this from one of the short sides of the phone (the bottom edge when facing the phone) since the long sides are curved. Once I flipped it in place, the flat protector was just resting on the two short side edges of the phone. I was then able to use the cardboard squeegee to push on edge with the protector and made very fine adjustments (although I didn't really need to, the hinge method seemed to work pretty well - I just get ultra picky with this sort of thing). Once it was &#34;resting&#34; in the right position, I pushed down (gently) in the center and it wicked most of it down on its own with just a few spots to push out with the squeegee.<br /><br />Also, I followed one of the instruction card's recommendations to steam up the bathroom a bit and do it in there (not a lot, just a bit). Along with using the wet and dry wipes, this really seemed to help. We have a dusty home and installations like this are always a pain, but this seemed to work well.<br /><br />Once it was on, it looks very professional. I was worried, as I've seen several iphones (4's and 5's) with similar protectors that just look awful - but it may just be the install job they did or something else.<br /><br />This fits with the case I have, but mine is admittedly a low profile and flexible that just comes up over the edge of the phone slightly. The inner edge of the screen side lip of my case sits right at the edge of the protector with no problems - it seems like a bulkier case would be ok with this.<br /><br />I've also had no scrolling or touch screen issues at all and it appears crystal clear to my eyes. I ordered a second/backup as soon as I finished installing this."
"Just what my old phone needed for battery power, works great now!  Thanks you"
Glad I bought this battery when I went to convert my 1st gen iPod Mini from harddisk to compact flash as the original battery had ballooned making it most difficult to slide the unit out of the case.  I don't know yet how well this battery will hold a charge since I've not yet been able to get the conversion to work.  Hopefully I just got a bad CF card but we'll see.
Junk. Cheaply made.
Slips out the the holster way too easy and Item received is not what is pictured. The stand mechanism wont hold the phone up in a landscape orientation because the mechanism is more towards the bottom than the picture depicts yielding the center of mass being outside the three points that are supposed to hold it up.
These are very flimsy and they don't really protect the phone. It's just nice to be able to switch the colors every day.
I bought this for a friend who needed a simple cover.  I was not sure if it fit the iPad 2 since I read conflicting reviews.  The iPad this was used for is not a min or anything other than a standard iPad2.  This fit perfectly and is a nice case for the money.  There are nicer looking cases with fancy stands and such but this fit the bill for a basic protection for the tablet and the face.  The face covering does not seem to interfere with operation at all.<br />It was easy to put on besides what some reviews have stated but it is tight.  Great value.
Nice for the price. Had a bad one at first but call dealer and got a replacement quickly. Great service
Back cover was a very nice quality plastic instead of glass. Would have preferred glass instead f plastic but for the price wasn't upset.<br /><br />Oddly enough the cover only had 1 screw bracket at the bottom and the other side was like a plastic fake standoff with no screw hole which results in only being able to secure the back plate with only 1 screw.<br /><br />Would not buy again but not worth returning.
"I liked this cable, it made of good material and its extremely useful."
"Lasts just as long as the OEM battery. If you have a note 4, this is a must buy. Ultra convenient and I no longer hunt for an outlet when I'm out and about."
This is just a wastage of money. Tempered glass came out within a week. And touch screen does not work well.
"The inside seems like it is a little flimsy, however it is covered with the rubber external case. Seems good, especially for the price."
Just recieved it today (8.29) and it was said to be arriving on (9.10-10.1) so im quite amazed tho I thought there was going to be a little cover thing for the jack like it showed in one of the pics but its okay i like it ^^
Great chords shared with my Granddaughter. You can never have to many of these it seems. The car charger works great and does not get in the way by sticking out too far.
"Great item. Love that it came in a 4-pack so I don't have to scramble to find one. Bought them because of the reasonable price, but still Apple MFi certified."
"This is one of the better choices from Tracfone as far as Smartphones are concerned. I will first state that you shouldn't get this phone if your not very tech savy. My mom uses a flip phone, and that's what I recommend for those who aren't inclined in the new social media hype. But if you are an internet junkie and already have a tablet or PC, or you just want a good low cost smartphone, this is it! The Samsung Galaxy Stardust is a feature packed phone for a ridiculously low price! It has a 1.2 Ghz dual core CPU. A 5 megapixel cameral with auto focus and takes good photos. It has a front facing &#34;selfie&#34; camera. It has a 4.5 inch, high resolution and very colorful screen. Tons of apps are available on Google Play and work great on this phone. I do recommend to go into your phone settings and look up application manager and disable some &#34;bloatware&#34; apps. (Some apps can run in the background and update and waste data.) You can do social media like Twitter or Facebook easily. This phone also uses Google Chrome and works superbly. You can do your email, gmail, and more. You can watch YouTube videos of course. Battery life is dependant on how you use your phone. I recommend setting brightness no higher than needed to see clearly. I have mine set to 1/3 of the scale. Anytime your not gonna be on the internet, turn off mobile data. That will really save a lot of battery and prevent data usage in the background. Set your screen timeout setting to no more than 5 minutes. That will add battery time. If you do all those things the phone will run all day. If not, don't expect the phone to run for about only 4 hours. The phone does recharge rapidly. The phone comes with the charger, a nice phone case, and a screen protector. I don't use the screen protector because the screen is glass and I'm pretty careful with my phone, but I do use the case. I recommend using the screen protector if your gonna be jamming your phone in your pocket or purse with keys and metal objects that could scratch the screen. All in all, I think this is a good phone. I recommend it.bjects that could scratch the screen. All in all, I think this is a good phone. I recommend it."
"I have a charging station in our family room for guests and family to easily charge phones and tablets.  It cleaned up the wires, and looks so much nicer.  I like it very much."
It doesn't charge properly. Waste of money. I won't recommend this.
Great Product!  I keep an Anker Battery in my backpack for emergencies (when i forget to charge my phone).  There are many times when I can not get to an outlet and this fixes that problem!  Perfect for a high school / college student who is on their phone 24/7 and needs to be able to recharge it at a moments notice!
Great
I have compared Garmin and TOMTOM for many years.  I bought 2 TOMTOMs and 2 Garmns before  I compared both of them this week. I return the Garmin and keep TOMTOM 60 S.  Because TOMTOM is better.  I do not know if TOMTOM 60S can be update map well.
"Tremendous product plus tremendous company with great customer service.  Very reasonable but very well made and stylish to boot.  I'm loving it..... and lifetime warranty?  Win, win!  Just buy it."
This was about an inch too short for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  Maybe it would fit a Galaxy S phone but definitely not the Note. Took 2 weeks to arrive so I was highly disappointed.  Hopefully they either refund or get me the right case.  Will re-review once the matter is handled.
I love this item. It is awesome. I can use my IPhone for mapping and it is within my vision while I drive! Doesn't obstruct my view.
Been Using it for about six months. No problems works great. I did get a 32gig card for it.
"I have had this device since April and it hasn't worked so well.  When I can get it to light up, I find the data is often verifiably wrong.  The app never syncs without  multiple tries.  Also, the disc pops out very easily.  Unfortunately, I have found it every time.  The disc is easily scratched as well. DONT BUY THIS!"
it very good cover and I like it to use for my iPhone it 2nd time I paid last time i pay 13000 mb but now i pay it for my family it very exelaint and having
not as expected from otterbox for the price should have been a lil better its less then a year and it has alot of wears and it stretched out
Don't work good. For rom higher than 4.2 you have to add a resitor k100 for that you have to buy a tools. Uart 532 not reconized.<br />I dislike it.
This case is everything I could ask for. This leather cases is so supple to touch and very nice looking.
"Batter life seems to be very poor. But, it works for now..."
This is a great case.  It looks good and functions properly.  After about 6 months of use it is showing a little wear on the back in the upper corners.  I also noticed a shadow of the window on the screen of the phone.  But one does not buy a $500 phone and be too cheep or stupid to put a quality screen protector on it.  I swapped out the $16 plastic Verizon screen protector for a $10 tempered glass protector. Problem solved.
"I am familiar with this device.  It was sold by Radio Shack some years back.  It has been upgraded w/an LED 'ON' light  -  a good feature in a battery powered device.  It works for me, but I would be happier if it had a volume control on the output.  Probably could use three volume controls. Maybe they could redesign the mother board - take out one of the out ports and put a volume control in it's place.  I have never had occasion to use more than two of the outlets."
I have always used screen protectors on my phones but this was my first tempered glass one. I always dreaded trying to get the flimsy plastic ones on without any bubbles and in the right spot ( There was always bubbles). So I was expecting the same thing but this product fits the device and NO BUBBLES! Of course it took a couple times for me to get it in the right place but once it goes on it sucks right on to the phone and literally had no problems. I will say im pretty satisfied with this.
Excellent case. Colors are exactly as shown.  Fits snugly on the phone. Thin enough for a small clutch.  Good purchase for the price.
This is my second case<br />The first last a decent amount of time then one thing after another start happening.<br />The second case the material start separating from the case in a few days.
"This is a really charming cover, and probably works well for average phone owners, but I've got an almost-toddler aged baby who really tests this cover. After only a month, the phone is still u damaged but there are small cracks in the case at the corners."
Over the years I have cracked a couple of screens.  Then I discovered SPECK when I had M7.  I dropped my phone on concrete a number of times and watched my phone bounce.  So I ordered this cover to be delivered before I bought my M8.  The day my cover came in I bought my M8.<br /><br />PROS:  Fits Perfect<br />Depth of cover protects the camera lens (that sticks out if you ever use a DOT cover)<br />The back of the cover grips help you hold the phone.<br />No matter how you drop phone it will bounce and not break.<br /><br />Cons - there are NONE
Its the wrong one for my phone I have the Galaxy S4 zoom but I kept it and used the 10 sec timer it works for now thanks
"I ordered two of these phones, one for my son and one for me.<br /><br />CONS:<br />One of the phones' chargers does not work, not with any of the phones or other phones for that matter. So I have to get another charger elsewhere.<br /><br />The other phone is unusable: it shuts down by itself, the battery levels are inconsistent (sometimes it will reboot by itself when it reaches 50%, but at boot it says it has 5% left, things like that), firmware won't update and it simply does not recognize the SIM card. It is basically garbage, or spare parts (if those actually work). I suspect it isn't even an original Sony phone, but a cheap knockoff sold as an original.<br /><br />Piece of garbage, and, conveniently, they have no warranty (ITL version) so the seller wouldn't do anything about it. So I got 1 phone for the price of 2.<br /><br />Buy this if you want to get scammed out of $275 (each phone).<br /><br />PROS:<br />The one that DOES work, is pretty good. Great battery life. I'd recommend you get it, but from another, honest seller."
"Great case. Colors are vivid, it was easy to get on and has already been dropped several times and looks no worse for the wear. Also didn't make it too bulky, like an otter box. Looking forward to this protecting my sons tablet from himself!"
"Works so far, good length."
"I bought this to replace a previous version which charged several different types of batteries, because the older model ([[ASIN:B0058XGN7I ]], while an awesome product, does not fully charge the battery for Galaxy S3 (I had bought that one to charge an S2). This one will fully charge the S3 battery within a few hours. The S3 battery fits firmly in the charger without need to line anything up or make sure it's positioned properly (aside from inserting it in the right direction, which is obvious). The battery I opened works as well as the original; as I already had extra batteries, I haven't opened the second battery yet. The only feature this one lacks which I would find useful is the ability to charge it in the car via USB, this one can only be plugged into the wall., meaning I still have to hold on to my other charger to take with me on the road."
"Bought this item for my girlfriend and she loves it. GREAT color, goes well with GOLD S6 Edge and very soft texture interior of case it protects the phone from scratches."
I don't know how you could go caseless with a Note 5. This thing is huge and gorgeous but super slippery. The Otterbox Defender invented grip and you will need it. The case is durable and adds plenty of protection to your Note 5. The port covers are excellent and the buttons are very responsive. The stylus with the new design is easier to take out then ever. This was not so fun on previous Note models. Just remember not to put the stylus in backwards (though I don't know how someone would do this). I would love to go without a protective case because the Note 5 looks so nice but it is way too expensive to try that. I would recommend the Defender for your Note.<br /><br />Edit: I can also confirm that the wireless charging works with the official Samsung charger and Otterbox.
Got my nice snorkeling videos ..was excited about that
Great efficency and bass. Mids and treble were above average quality. Fast shipping. Great price.
soft rubber feel.  should protect phone very well.
"The glass fit well, but once on, I was not able to access the edge screen on the left side without swiping numerous times. Once switched to the right side, the text would show upside down.  The left side of the keyboard was also difficult to operate. I would need to press several keys repeatedly or press very hard."
"I love the look of the case, it is a bit hard to hold on to just because of its so smooth but other than that I love the look of it and it fits great."
"It does protect, but isn't as aesthetically pleasing as the picture. The trim looked like real metal, but it's plastic and kind of flabby. The &#34;leather&#34; part feels more like, well, plastic. It's just sitting in a drawer."
I bought this battery because my small factory battery only lasted about 9-10 hours. I was hoping this one would last much longer but it only lasts about 6 hours and is 3x the size of the other battery.
"I really like it. This is my first android smartphone and it is being really nice to me. everything it said is in place. The only problems i had so far are when i am playing certain games it doesn't click exactly where i want.This could be just because the game or i'm just touching the phone weird. Overall, it is a big pretty phone and i am happy."
Case looks awesome! Goes great with glass screen protector. The volume rocker is kind of wonky but overall i'm happy.
Yes its good. I don't know why people buy more expensive ones. This does everything.  You can also take the metal part off. And use the plastic one
Great case for my phone. Good quality for the price
"Spray bottle contains dirt, causes a huge mess and needed to clean the protector before reapplying it again. The protector eventually got damaged because of this."
does not fit the stated otter case ..... not so generic too narrow in width and too long in length also the ports differ... as they say get what you pay for... no wonder so cheap &quot; Made in China&quot; ........
"I'm giving this case three stars because of 1) the hole in the back and 2) my headphones will not fit through the port opening. The hole in the back is obnoxious because with iPod touches, you can barely see the apple logo. The hole looks like it's there for no reason, and it is also way bigger than the apple logo. The main reason why I gave this case 3 stars is because the headphone port is so small. I will have to cut it open somehow to get my earbuds to fit through.<br /><br />The volume and power buttons are also pretty hard to press through the case. The volumes take a bit of strength, but they usually press on the first try and I can feel the button going down. The power button is very hard to press, and I cannot fell when I actually press it. It usually takes 2-3 tries for me to get the screen off.<br /><br />The case fits snugly on my iPod and I don't have to worry about it falling out of the case, and the edges are raised, but barely. I have not dropped my iPod since I received the case, so I don't know how it will hold up against shocks."
"It was everything I was hoping when I ordered, excellent quality, beautiful as the picture and protects the phone wonderfully. I received it in good time. Would recommend the item and seller to anyone."
love the fact that this has radio. sounds pretty good too. the only thing is the charging cover detached pretty easily. not easy putting the cover back on.
"Case works good, it does not close well if you stick credit cards or the like in the slots so that can be a problem."
"This screen protector took less than 20 seconds to attach and it is awesome, so glad I bought this one. I also got one for my sister's S6 :-)"
It's good but unless since it doesn't come with the sim card. Unless you don't want to use data then you should be good.
Had a problem with first cord only worked for a month. Daughter had problems with the additional warranty refrigeration. Contacted the company and they replaced. No problems so far and great customer service.
Not for Galaxy S5.  Cover for S4 is slightly too small which keeps the lens permanently out of focus.
Did not fit phone
"Case arrived and it looked like someone fell asleep at the sewing machine while sewing the stiching on the back of the case. The whole back is supposed to be criss crossed then there's one long line over all the cross stich in the back, just looks poorly made. First time I've ordered off Amazon and the 3 things I ordered 2 of them were horrible."
"I received on August 07 2015 the GPS and on August 29 the equipment doesn't turn on, I connected to my computer to see if with other source of energy the equipment re-start again, however the equipment is death.<br />I feel like this company stolen my money selling this equipment that does not last at least a month. Is unacceptable for me this situation, and I expect that nobody have to face this..."
"Absolutely appalling sound quality. Even turned all the way up, can only hear treble - no mids  or bass at all.<br /><br />Constantly glitching  and dropping connection.<br /><br />Would never buy anything from Jabra again."
Awesome case
"I bought the phone refurbished and the phone's ear speaker does not work and the phone consistently keeps turning off even though it has battery. I contacted DYNA cell about the issue and have not had a response, I am now waiting to see if they accept my request to return the phone seeing that I paid $240 for it."
Was looking for something in prep for Watch OS2 to old watch sideways for night stand mode and not slide around. Can't beat this and the right price.
This is my second purchase (thanks to an over active teenager). Both worked as they should with quick shipping. Great product
This phone case is a great quality and very colorful. I would buy from this business again!
Amazing phone for the price! Paid $99 for this and for what you get honestly it's a steal!
Thogh it was great as soon I put on phone but within a week it starting coming out of corners...I don't know if I have a drfactive piece...
"I bought one of these in March 2012, and I've worn it almost every day over the last 3+ years. I just ordered another because the original is showing signs of wear (see below).<br /><br />* Aside from the horrible pun, the &#34;Tooth Ferry&#34; works well enough. I keep a Plantronics Voyager Pro in mine, and the elastic is as stretchy as ever.. I do not leave the headset powered on.<br /><br />* The magnetic closure works great. I can silently open and close the case when necessary, but this is one of the things that wore out. The magnet in the case body attracts a steel plate in the flap. The plate was glued in place but it came loose, allowing the plate to move around. The plate is further held in the flap by a fabric lining, but now the lining has all but worn away where it covers the steel plate (when the plate's in place).<br /><br />* The clip has never failed. As suggested by other reviews and responses, it's nearly impossible to clip onto a belt that's already being worn— but it never falls off, either. Threading a belt through it while donning the belt is the only way.<br /><br />* The swivel mechanism makes wearing it comfortable whether sitting or standing, worn on the left or right. It has detents every 90°, but after three years of regular use, the detents are worn, too. The case pretty much swivels past them now.<br /><br />* The case's exterior shows virtually no signs of wear.<br /><br />Three years use for under $10: It works for me."
"Best smartphone Samsung has ever made so far. The smart pen, great battery life, gorgeous QHD display, and big 3 GB RAM are all the best features that Samsung Note 4 has.to compete with any other phone in the current market.<br /><br />Easy upgradable to 64 GB with a mini memory stick on Amazon for extra $15 or less. Removable battery is a big plus and this phone will last for more than 10 years if one uses it carefully.<br /><br />I replaced my Samsung S4 phone with this new white Note 4 which is a great decision made this year.<br /><br />In general, a smartphone's battery will turn short after a couple years of use. My old Samsung S4's battery could be used up within a couple hours for reading news and watching videos after a full charge, but this Note 4 can last at least 6-8 hours."
Excellent stylus.  I've purchased at least 6 so far and sending them out as early Christmas presents.  So far everybody loves them.  I have all 3 colors and would buy more if they had other colors.  I can't say enough.  For the money you can make any techie happy.  Super fast on shipping.  Definitely a five star plus company.  Thanks Dan J.
The front was scratched and it did not fit my Samsung galaxy 5 active phone very well. It also didn't have a spot for the buttons so while in the case it was almost impossible to use. I returned it for my money back
"I'm not extremely excited about this car charger.  Simply put, it says lightening fast, but it doesn't charge any faster than my cheapie ones that I have gotten for free from various companies.<br /><br />It looks awesome and I like that it has two ports.  I can charge my phone and my ipad or my phone and my extra charger for it at the same time.  It said the charge time for an iphone would be about an hour and a half.  I charged it starting with my phone at 10% for an hour and a half and it was only up to 33%.  I tried it with both an apple cord and a generic cord that I use to charge my phone with.  I don't remember where it was at in the picture I was taking.  I had planned to do pictures throughout the charging process, but I got a call that my son's dad was being taken to hospice.  I just ran and picked him up and didn't bother doing the rest of the photo series I wanted to do.<br /><br />I would still use this daily just for the charging.  I would not use it when I need to charge my phone quickly.  I would charge it on my portable charger for that."
purchased in 2010 and still works like a champ.  Good volume on both ends of the connection.  Charge lasts months.  Recharges in less than an hour.
"I received my portable charger free in exchange for an honest review. I have been looking for a small charger for sometime, one that would fit in a pocket. Well I found it! And it has a flashlight,  how handy is that! My grandsons cell is constantly going dead, we all know why (teenager) lol. This charger is perfect and when he has football practice now instead of walking through the dark this lights his way too! Really neat idea. He loves the size it isn't bulky or heavy. Now that phone stays charged!"
Great product has everything you need in one package. Was a pleasure to work with hottcell will buy from again.
"This is a great case with some small issues.<br /><br />Issues:<br /><br />1. The cutout for the USB charger is a bit too small for most 3rd party charging cables. The Samsung cable that comes with the phone, and with most Samsung phones fits perfectly. I have a 3rd party cable at my office and one in my car. The one in the office is just a hair too big to fit in the cutout so it will not insert far enough to charge the phone. The car charger cable fits in, but just barely, which causes the cable to disconnect anytime you touch the phone.<br /><br />2. Wireless charging. I do not have the Samsung wireless charger, but a friend does and after reading a couple reviews, I can confirm that the wireless charging does not work enough to actually charge the phone. It will keep it right around the same level it is when you put it on, but will not charge it more than that. So if you put the phone on the charger and the battery is at 50%, it will stay at 50% no matter how long you leave it there. I am pretty sure this would hold true for most cases so be aware of this if you plan on using the wireless charing capabilities of the phone.<br /><br />The case itself seems well made and helps keep the look of the phone somewhat. It does add some bulk to the phone, but very little. With the glass back of the phone, a case is mandatory in my opinion. I went to the AT&T store to look at these phones a day after the display models were placed on the floor and both the Note 5 and S6plus display models had the back glass cracked on them already. I usually do not use a case with my phones, but with this one, I would not take a chance, especially when you are paying $700 for a phone."
"I take 300-500 pics a day, so I am always transferring pics to my laptop. For some reason, the adapters that come with the micro SD cards always wear out, while the actual micro SD never does. This saves having to buy a micro SD just to get the adapter"
"My daughter uses this case 24/7. It is well made and extremely functional. Place for phone, cards and change or other small loose ends. I can't say enough good things about it."
Cute way to hide a necessity.  I keep this in my hiking backpack and I like that the cover is washable.
Handy little cables.  Nice for connecting audio devices.
Good cover. Phone just bounces when dropped. Husband can remove it easily to remove battery daily. So far it's not stretching out.
Fits very well. Great with the phone. Nice grip.
"Case is beautiful combination of colors BUT the case was difficult to put on my phone as the two pieces cannot be put on separately. Further, the case color keeps rubbing off on my hand! Case seems to be semi protective but I don't know if it is worth it having a &#34;pink&#34; hand from the color coming off ..."
Took the all-in- one to Scotland and it performed perfectly despite the fact that we were in many country inns and B&B's with questionable wiring.
"Wow am blown away by the value you get from this phone for the price, I must admit I had a issue at first the battery wouldn't charge. Anyways the screen is lovely the phone performs as a champ. Even though its only 1gb of ram I experience no setbacks. I am not running anything heavy on this phone but it must be noted I did have over 10 apps open at one point and did not notice any issues. My son also installed two car games lol he is 3 and they are more intensive than what I play.   I got this phone on preorder for 80$ but I must admit it would well be worth the 130 standard price.    UPDATE  using the phone while apps are being updated is pretty difficult lag can indeed be notice, is is prob because of the ram anyway I still give it 5 stars just set it to update when u not planning to use it"
Ok so I got this in march of this year. I put some games on it and and I play them a lot. Now I try to play one game and my battery is dead within ten minutes. This is not good I have battery saver apps and that does not help. The rest of it is ok but it does no good if it will shut off on you within a couple minutes of using it.  Update: After looking online for a replacement battery and not finding anything withing the price I wanted. I was about to give up on the phone and buy something else. In a last ditch effort I looked at the compartment for the battery. To me it seems a little over-sized. So I took a small piece of card-stock and wedged it in there to force the battery closer to the terminals. After doing that I am no longer having any problems with the battery. If the company would make the compartment a little smaller or the battery a little bigger it would be fine. i am back to liking the phone again.
Excellent in service and product.
"This SoundBot Bluetooth Headset for kids is so adorable. I bought them for my toddler that loves listening to music everyday. He usually takes Daddys Bluetooth headset and jams out all day but they are too big on him. So when I saw that these were kids sized I knew he would love them.<br /><br />He was so excited when I opened these up. He was literally jumping up and down. He wants to be like his daddy so bad and these help him.<br /><br />They fit his little head perfectly and they are very easy to set up. I gave him my old phone to use so he can connect it to Bluetooth and listen to the kids songs on Pandora. The headband is fully adjustable so it will fit all ages. It is very Light-weight and has a built-in rechargeable battery. It has a wireless range of up to 33 feet which is very far for a Bluetooth. It also has a Built-in microphone for handsfree calling so when daddy calls from work he can talk to him with ease. It has 12 hours of talk time, 11 hours of music playback time and 250 hours of standby time which is impressive.<br /><br />My favorite feature is the Smart Volume- IQ Technology because it limits the maximum audio volume to 85db-90db to protect children's hearing at safety levels.<br /><br />When I first received the headset I fully charged the battery which took about 3 hours. You will know when it is fully charged because the Red LED will change to Blue. They do recommend that you fully charge the battery on the first 3 uses to ensure the battery's best performance. And not to leave the headset charging after the charging is complete because it may shorten the life of the battery.<br /><br />To setup- Make sure the headset is off then press and hold the Multifunction button for 5 seconds, and release it until the blue and red LED alternates to enter the pairing mode. Go to the Bluetooth settings on your phone and search for new devices. Then select SB272 from the list. If it asks you to enter a password or Pin # then enter &#34;0000&#34;. Once it is paired you are ready to listen to music or take phone calls. I set up Pandora for my son and put on kids songs. He loved it and wouldn't stop dancing.<br />I highly recommend these Amazing Headsets for anyone looking for a High Quality Bluetooth Headset for their child.

"I purchased this for my 4year old in May 2015 and already they are not working, e.g. intermittent no sound or low volume.  Just 3 months and they have failed.  My husband and I supervise our daughter when she is using them. So we know that she hasn't been too rough them.  I have tried to contact them via Amazon and let me see if they write back.  Update. I contacted the company and told them about the headset not working. They just set me a replacement and contacted me to make sure I got it. Great customer service! Hopefully no problems from this point out."
I have used a money clip for ever because I don't like things in my pocket. But the cell case can hold a few crisp bills and a couple cards so it's perfect  for the carrying out and especially  the gym.
"Pretty impressed by this watch. Got it as a present for my hubby & he loved the capability of the many things you can accomplish with the watch. It's not IWatch by Apple, but it's really nice."
"So far really like the styluses. Used them just a bit, so I will post a revised review when I've used them more. They seem to be great quality, are light weight and very easy for the iPad to read."
"Does not fit the s5 acive. Too big, and cant return because i discovered it was too big trying to put one on. Frusterating when it specifically says it will fit the phone you have and doesnt. Probably meant dor the s5. Yal need to know the s5 active is just a little smaller then the s5."
"Purchased in June, after 6 months they leaked (yes, both of them). The original Panasonics lasted 2 years."
"This is a review of Multi-Port Quad USB 4 Port Wall Charger by Celltronix - Quick Charge 4.0 Amp Output - For iPhone 5S 5C 5 4S iPad 3 4 Mini Air<br /><br />Honestly, who doesn’t need every outputs for your electronics.  We all have cell phones, iPad, computers, etc.  This 4 Port Wall Charger is made to help keep your life organized and it does a great job.<br /><br />I was surprised by how little and compact it was but I love it.  I love having one place where my iPad, cell phone and husband’s stuff can be plugged in.  No more running around trying to find out where I could hook up or working with that half battery on my cell since I can now charge.<br />This is great for everyone.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchanged for an unbiased and truthful review.  This is 100% my thoughts."
Works great even a blind person can operate. Goodbye sim card chopper man for charging me arm and a leg. The only problem I have is I grow gray hair waiting for this product on my door steps besides not a big deal.
"I've only had it about a week , but while it does carry a good sized charge for my Galaxy 5 it takes a very long time to charge . Just now , I've had it charging by house plug for about an hour and it has only one LED indicator light on . Which means it's only a quarter charge at most . Is this typical of Li-ion phone bank and it won't get any better with any other brand ? Like I said it's slower than directly charging my phone by wall charger . Any useful input would be helpful . God bless ."
"Let me stat by saying that they are very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is extremely good. The Bluetooth connection is solid and there's no popping, cracking or hissing. Voice sound quality of phone conversations is very clear. Paring the headphones is as simple as holding down the power button to turn it on but don't let go until the led flashes, then on your device you should just select it from the list and it should be paired, but I can say you have to hold the button down a bit longer than you do for other Bluetooth devices, but outside of that it awesome. The units arrived in a very timely fashion Amazon Prime baby!!! The packaging is very straight forward box with plastic tray in which the headphones are coiled up. I like the flat cable and the colors are bright and vivid. I purchased one in orange and one in blue, they are identical in every way except the color.  I only have one caveat and that is one of the ear buds popped right off while I was sitting buy the pool and I could not find it and there's only one of each size in the bag and so I could not continue to use this product. I found the buds do seam to come off very easily when not in your ear, and for that functionality, (or lack there of), that is why I took off one star.<br />I would buy another one because they are an excellent pair of headphones."
It was good except it needs a rubber thing in between it so if you drop it the hard case won't smash the screen in
"ok, love this product, however, make sure you mount it properly or it will, absolutely be garbage."
Doesn't fit well. The left side top is little misaligned. It is textured so doesn't match with my 2004 sienna. I should have read the review and bought Scosche TA2088B. I had it professionally installed.
"We purchased 4 of these switches for our condo.  They work through the Wemo / Blekin App; however, the integration with IFTTT is not reliable.  If you're looking for a wireless switch that you can control with your phone - these are OK.  The setup process is somewhat unclear as the switches start/restart a number of times - but ultimately they do work well when installed.<br /><br />If you're looking for IFTTT integration - look elsewhere.  I was able to get one switch to reliably communicate to/from IFTTT.  When I add others, I experienced the same 15-45 (sometimes hours) delays.  I contacted Belkin/Wemo support with out success.  They did respond; however, they sent me directions that were inaccurate every time.  I ended up finding the correct instructions on their website and notifying them of this.<br /><br />I would summarize as:<br />4 1/2 Stars - Function once installed<br />1 Star - Setup (confusing, if you are not tech savvy this setup will be really frustrating)<br />1 1/2 Stars - IFTTT integration; works for one switch (probably) but definitely not more than one<br /><br />I'm looking to Insteon next as their Dual Band setup is local to your network and uses power line modulation to communicate as well.  Hopefully, this  breaks the barrier into more reliable, inexpensive controls."
Bought two of these things and they both stopped working. The connector got loose and the units won't charge themselves.  Piece of junk!
"No problems with these. Price was great for a pack of 9. Most important, they work just fine on my phone and tablet. I am happy with this purchase."
It worked okay.  I didn't like the way it kept blowing cold air on my cellphone after a trip with the AC on.  The phone was like an ice cube.  Also I have a Samsung S6 and use the wireless charger well the magnetic the metal plate blocked it from charging.
This product has protected my Iphone from all damage and it is easy to put on your phone.
"The MPERO Kyocera Hydro C5170 5 Pack Screen Protectors are something that I decided to grab up for my two Kyocera Hydro C5170 phones which are still being protected as of now since I first bought them from Amazon,the time of delivery was spot on as they came to the house like somewwhere around in the evening since that was the time I went downstairs then I saw that they were sitting on top of one my cousin's speakers and one of my few years older cousins pointed it out to me that my package got in.I was happy that these screen protectors worked as advertised because I was on the lookout for ones for my two Kyocera Hydros to be protected at least screenwise if not the whole body of the unit.These screen protectors were pretty simple to install on my phones and didn't take long to arrive which I really liked a lot,but the only thing that I have a gripe with is air bubbles.Whenever I tried to place them on without the air getting behind the adhesive side it somehow still has the air bubbles anyway well the first Kycera Hydro phone but when I moved onto the second one it was different and they were less air bubble one that then the first device which is good now I just need a good case for these phones then they'll be fully protected."
"Worked great!  Easy​ to adapt, to the local plugs, USB plugs make it easy to recharge items.  Couldn't ask for better!"
This is my second purchase of this item but from a different company than the first. I changed phones and thought that I needed a different size. Thank fully my first one still fits as this one is very dull and unattractive.
"LOVE IT! I have had several car vent holders and none have worked. This one does. It fits easily on my vent securely holds the phone in place. I can remove it easily. I keep my Galaxy S4 in an Otterbox case and the supplied magnet (2 are provided so you can use multiple devices, 1 at a time)  attaches to the case. I just returned from  trip over bumpy roads and the phone never came off or moved on the holder. I tried it in both my Ford and GMC truck and it fits well in each of them..<br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&#34;"
"This is the 2nd time I've purchased a Caseology case for my phone (previous one was an S4) and I have to say I'm super impressed with the quality and design of their cases. My gold/coral coloured case looks just as I expected (it's definitely coral, not pink) and it looks very well made. The hard plastic portion is nicely molded with a smooth finish, no rough edges. The ridged, rubber part of the case isn't quite as &#34;grippy&#34; as I expected but it seems to do the trick i.e. when the phone vibrates, it's enough to keep the phone stationary on a smooth surface. The lip of the case also protects the surface of the phone when it's face down. The overall look is very sleek and not cheap like some of the other cases I've seen. We'll see how well the gold finish lasts over time (I just received my case today). My phone snapped into the case easily and is also easily removed. The provided instructions for removing the phone from the case were helpful, I can see how if you're not careful you could deform the hard plastic frame of the case so you might want to give those instructions a quick glance when you receive your case. I find it best to carefully peel the case off the bottom end of the phone where there's less plastic frame and then slide the phone out."
This was used to replace the original battery in a second hand HTC Incredible that would not hold a charge for more than a day (or a few hours sometimes).<br />This replacement will go standby for five days and have plenty of power for apps and talk time as needed.  This is an impressive battery and exceeded my expectations.
"Didn't fit my phone correctly. Part of the protector came up halfway over my camera. Before I put it on my screen I tried taking pictures by holding the protector in place and it made half of the view blurry. Tried using the website for help like the directions in the box say and the video was unavailable. While trying to apply the protector and try and get it under the camera area I snapped the protector in half. Oopsie. So I never got a chance to actually use this product. Directions weren't helpful, and I've put ikea furniture together by myself. Maybe it's just me."
best emergency charger .  holds a charge for at least 2 months and charged my devices  faster than my wall or car car charger.  also has a built in led light which can be useful in a pinch.  i was impressed enough that i purchased  another one for the home.  highly recommend!
It was a little smaller than I was expecting but it's super cute and does its job perfectly.
Phone fit perfectly.  Leather is nice. Pleased with purchase
"Not wide enough for current generation of smartphones.  Does feel very solid.  However, for my preferences it would nicer if the tilt was less vertical."
The chord actually works just fine.  My issue is with the connector at goes into the phone.  I have a iPhone 6 and use an Otterbox Defender case with it.  The width of the cable connector makes it unusable with the Otterbox Defender case.
"it's says it stainless steel but it isn't shiny like the stainless steel watch, will it's shiny only from side were the holes at. here's a photo.  it's easy to install, no additional tools needed, the holes in the side make it really easy to change the bands when ever you want unlike other adapters I've tried.  I've used it now for around a month and still in a good shape."
"Just got this case today. I got the turquoise mint color, which is really just a mint color, not as bright as the picture. Still a really pretty color though. The case looks like good quality, doesn't feel cheap. I was a bit afraid that the lip of the case wouldn't be high, bc I always look for a raised lip for good protection on a phone. The lip is as raised as my last case, but it's still pretty good. One con may be that the case is glossy so you often don't get a really good grip on the case while picking it up, which may cause you to drop it. After reading the reviews, I was expecting some sparkle to the case, which I was excited about, but honestly the shimmer is only really noticeable in the sunlight, and even then it's barely noticeable. The case fits snugly around my phone and isn't loose in any places and doesn't feel flimsy. This is a tou case. Overall I think this is a pretty good case. I have yet to drop it, I'm thinking if I dropped it face down it might not be as well protected but I have yet to find out about that."
I thought it was going to be a hard case but it's the gel kind I guess...it took some use to (that was my fault for not reading the reviews) but it fits nice and it's and okay case
"Functional. Slightly bulky, but overall snug and comfortable fit around my arm, stays in place while running. Would recommend."
Yes. It has been a good case.
"Since we ordered the two day shipping, it came fast and right on time. It's really pretty and easy to pop off the iPhone."
Very usefull and handy Battery Backup with multiple output. Usefull for long travels and picnics
My daughter put it on and i used it for 3 weeks before she told me she had already installed it. it is nick like original screen.
Matches  the  EOM charger.
"the team is very good . very elegant, the performance of the cameras and the excellent display. the only thing wrong is the battery life . nothing is perfect"
"Works great, but the magnet gave my screen a dead spot when using the stylus, but only when using the stylus. Why am I still using this case, because turns out I never use my stylus."
Great product.  Worked like expected.
"better than normal especially for this price. Not sure how durable yet (just got 'em), but better than the $15 variety ones that the kids go through about every 6 months.  UPDATE:  Had to activate the warranty, and that was easy. just took a photo of them cut up, and they sent new ones very quickly."
"Thin plastic cover, not bulky with black rubber inserts around the outer edge for protection and screen protector. This cover fits over the factory case on the Lumina 635 windows phone. No problems with on/off or volume controls, although charger flap stays up after charge up, great purchase for the price."
"Kinda bummed that I couldn't use any of the accessories with my iPhone 5 when I moved to my iPone 6+, but totally loving this mount!"
Good product. Easy to install. I like that it comes will multiple so I can change them out when my old one gets too many scratches.
Garmin is the best.  Great contrast in color and very accurate.
Nice starter watch and easy to configure. Great price and works as described with several configurations for background screen. Thanks!
"Piece of garbage!! I seriously don't understand how the rating for this product is 3.5 stars....<br /><br />The sound is awful! After playing around with it, I realized I have to twist and turn the plug in different directions to get optimal sound.... AND leave it in that position.... which leaves for no hands on the driving wheel. Talk about dangerous!<br /><br />Waste of $8; I'm pissed. Screw you BESDATA"
so far so good.  The built in screen protector takes a bit getting used to.. Also the case is very close to screen edges and bottom buttons.  Sometimes it's difficult to push the back or option buttons.
Nice product nd excellent customer service. Quick resolution of complaints
"I like this case a lot. It's a tiny bit bulky but not terrible. I've had it almost two years. The back has worn down in the middle to the white plastic from laying it on my desk every day. I don't care about the aesthetics. If it wears through  completely, I'll buy another to replace. Price was great."
"I bought this specifically for the sunrise feature...and I love it! I really struggle to wake up early in the winter, and I was looking for a light that would turn on at a specific time. The sunrise feature not only turns on at a specific time, it also gradually goes from deep red to bright light. When I use it I am able to wake up to my alarm without hitting the snooze button, and sometimes I am up before the alarm (it starts to turn on 30 minutes before the set time for &#34;sunrise&#34;). I also appreciate that you can use your own photos to create a scene for the bulb.<br /><br />I have had a couple of strange things happen with the bulb/app, but nothing that I couldn't fix by either disconnecting and reconnecting the bulb, or by restarting my phone. Here are the issues I have had (but again, I have been able to correct them all myself): 1) Every once in a while the sunrise feature doesn't start (I have had the bulb for about a month, and this has happened three times). The error message will say the app &#34;stopped working and had to close&#34;. 2) The app and the bulb will stop communicating and I will have to close and restart the app so I can change the scene on the bulb. 3) The other night was the strangest occurrence - after I hit &#34;lights out&#34; on the sunrise feature the bulb flashed a small amount of light every couple of minutes. I couldn't figure out what was going on so I restarted my phone and when the bulb reconnected it worked fine again."
"The Nuvi 2257LMT with lifetime maps did not work correctly.  We have owned five Garmin's and this one could not give correct directions most of the time.  The maps were updated and everything, so possibly was just a bad unit?  Amazon accepted the return.  We will try a different Garmin model # and hope for better luck."
"[[VIDEOID:645d0b4e697a60fd21e86efd9336fad2]] Charging our devices in the car is great way to keep your device topped off. With more and more devices having big batteries and are Quick charge 2.0 capable, we need to have more than one port chargers in our car.<br /><br />Checkout this my review of this great little time saver that Tronsmart sent me for review."
"[[VIDEOID:94001531f28c9291b815876c512fca45]]The video shows off the battery pack and gives my impressions of it, and below are some highlights.<br /><br />Granted, this isn't the flattest battery pack out there, but it is very flat for a pack with this high of a capacity.  12000mAh is a good bit of juice, and this pack is pretty slim for that class of pack.  However, they have to get the volume somewhere.  :)  Soonhua chose to go with a wider yet slimmer pack compared to other designs out there, so it's about what size you like.  This one is more like a tablet form factor compared to other packs that are more like a phone form factor.  It really caught me off guard when I first opened the box because I hadn't really paid much attention to the picture that shows the dimensions and missed that it's about 4\\"" wide.  Although I was surprised at first, it's a great form factor for things like placing it underneath of a tablet while you're traveling (say, on a plane trip) to give you more time to enjoy your movie or whatever.<br /><br />Build quality is very good, with nice rounded edges everywhere and I smooth yet non-slippery surface coating.  Nothing rattles at all or feels loose.<br /><br />The 2A input is great and, IMO, almost a requirement for a pack of this capacity.  That equates to about a six-hour charge time versus it taking 12 hours if this had a 1A input.  That's a great time savings.  Having one 1A output and one 2A output is pretty standard these days, although I recently was able to review a [[ASIN:B013D9MOA8 Swees® 14000mAh]] pack with two \\""smart\\"" ports that provides a nice alternative.  I absolutely recommend that Swees pack, but it does have a more standard form factor and costs just a bit more as I type this.  So, you give up a bit of capacity and smart ports with this model, but you get a slimmer package and save a few dollars.<br /><br />I like that this pack offers an alternative form factor for those of you who would like a slimmer and wider pack versus the standard sizes available.  With the functionality and great build quality at the current $14 price, I certainly think that this is worthy of five stars.  Soonhua did a nice job with this.<br /><br />(I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)ble.

"Very happy with the product.  I have an F-150 with that silly coin holder on the dash.  I removed the coin holder and used the adhesive disk in that location.  It holds the phones (I use a iPhone 6 and 5S) very well and is easy to change orientation when needed.  I would like a little more articulation of the the head relative to the arm, but it looks like it's designed to move about as much as geometry will allow."
Shipping was on time. Great product!
FiTs  good over my  LG  ULTIMATE  2 L41C  CONTROLS  WORK  FINE UNDER COVER  NON SLIP FEEL GOOD STANDS  AND BELT CLIP FULL  PROTECTION  GREAT  CASE
great product - I suggest you google for better installation instructions though... it's much easier than the packaging makes it look
"Thanks to the good people at EC Technologies for providing a free pair in return for an honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />I have reviewed a lot of Bluetooth earphones and perhaps through a quirk of the shape of my ears, I generally prefer the ‘loop over the ears’ over the ‘poke into your ears’ style.  There three different sizes of earbuds and a couple of pairs of rubber hook things to hold the earbuds in place in the ear. With a bit of experimentation I got them comfortably and securely in my ears so that even with a lot of jiggling about it did not feel that there were in danger of falling out. They are larger than the average headset but the shiny anodised finish and the green cable make them look very smart.<br /><br />They arrived conservatively but neatly packaged with the ubiquitous USB-micro-USB cable and a perfectly adequate manual. After charging for three hours or so, they paired without problem with my Android phone and the simple controls allow volume change, track skipping and pause.  If you have hard builder’s hands like mine, you might find the controls a little fiddly and hard to find but you get used to them and for most people I’m sure they’re fine.  You can also make (last number redial) and receive calls via the headset and, when calling, your voice is clear with no interference. The cable goes neatly behind the head so that if the phones do fall out they won’t fall far and the flat cable seems highly resistant to tangling. They A full charge lasts for about seven hours of continuous listening at a moderate volume and a full recharge then takes about three hours.<br /><br />The sound quality is absolutely superb with a very deep bass, rich mid-tones and clear treble. The volume is sensibly limited to a perfectly reasonable un-damaging level and the Bluetooth range is excellent, but when signal is eventually lost the current track is paused after a couple of gentle beeps.<br /><br />A good quality, well designed set of earphones with good range & battery life, excellent sound quality and value for money.nes with good range & battery life, excellent sound quality and value for money."
I love my case so much but the only thing is the stand is kind of weird and it doesnt hold up too straight it kinda holds at a angle but other then that its protected my phone against some pretty hard falls and i always get compliments on it:)
"I didn't really know what to expect going in to this purchase. There are several companies that make high end screen protectors and I really just kinda picked one. Glad I chose this one. This is absolutely crystal clear glass with a thick and durable feel to it. I've only ever used soft, flimsy screen protectors that scratch easily and always end up with air bubbles. Instead what I got was actual hard glass that almost magically adheres to the screen by itself, bubble - free. It doesn't cover the entire faceplate, just the screen, so there's a noticeable edge where the screen edges are, but still great. Also impossible to scratch. Pleased with the purchase."
"The seller of this product sent an email looking for feedback on this product.  While we bought this charger (2 of them)  and the cords that go with it, we have found that our IPhones and IPads are not FULLY charging with either one of the units we purchased.  Disappointing as we have a number of these Apple devices in our home and we were looking for an efficient way to charge our devices.  They do work on our devices but our IPhones and Ipads are all less than 6 months old but with these particular chargers never get past 75% of their charge while the original Apple chargers we received with the products fully charge our devices.  I would still give it 3 stars because they do somewhat work and get our devices to an acceptable level.  We appreciated the follow up email thanking us for purchasing the product and looking for feedback.  I would have sent an email to the seller directly, but could not find a way to do that."
"Great case, buy it"
We purchased 2 of these cords within 2 weeks of each other.  They BOTH stopped functioning within the 1st 15 days.  Tested them on 2 different iPads.
"The light was on when I opened the box.  We've been using it for almost two months and it's an excellent charger.  It charges my wife's iphone 6 plus like 3 times so far on one charge, but haven't really tested it fully.  Loving the charger.  Don't have to worry about finding an electrical outlet.  We took it to a theme park and it was great, could take all the photos we want with our phones."
"I've used this charger while traveling a few times now. Many car chargers cannot keep up with the power consumption of GPS but this one can.<br />In use, I'm not entirely sure the 0-60% in 30 minutes claim is true, but I think if the phone was doing less it probably would be.<br /><br />It comes with one cable, and two ports. Make sure if you use any other cables that you use a cable that can utilize the output of this charger, as a lot of cheaper ones cannot."
"Comes with 2 ports, one labeled for Apple products and one for non-Apple. Both work with my iPhone 5 and do not cause any errors when charging. Also works for iPad Mini without issues."
"It's a good product, but it's not the best out there. I thought it would have a beer use than having my 1 year old playing with it since it's big for my galaxy s6 edge and the photos are not to good, also you are not able to lock it or turn the volume up or down unless you open the case and get it out"
As promised as advertised...great addition to my wallet collection
Saved my boyfriends phone... the phone was left on the hood of my car in this case.. slid off the hood going 50 mph bounced off windshield and landed on the highway... the case is a little tore up but phone doesn't have a scratch on it...
"Great cord for a low price for an expensive phone.  It came on time and in a taped folded paper.  I didn't care how it was packaged, as long as it works and it does.  You will not be disappointed, it has been over two weeks now and it still works like a champ.  I recommend purchasing this cord, it doesn't come with a USB wall charger, just the cable, as it is clearly stated, my cord was broken so I just needed a cord and this was exactly what I needed."
"The stylus part itself works just fine. My issue is that the rubber tip breaks almost every use. Pretty subpar quality, but it was quite a cheap purchase."
Great idea but turned out to be a piece of junk<br />Only the fish eye lens works the others do not screw into place<br />Also the lens fell off the fisheye but can still be used.<br />Waste of money but will keep it to save the hassle of returning it
"I bought this for my sister who lives abroad.  She had no problems getting service through her local international provider.  The phone takes very stunning pictures - better than my wife's iPhone!  The unlocked feature made it a bit expensive in USD, but it was still cheaper than buying in Europe or Asia."
"Better than the newer HBS750. I have both and I reverted to my old standby ,the 730 after the newer one freaked out.It started vibrating and wouldn't stop after a workout."
"Fit my phone (LG Stylo) perfect. It doesn't make the phone bulky like some other cases. It has a matte smooth finish all around, but the sides are a little rugged to give you better grip when holding the phone. Overall, I'm very happy with this case."
Great kit for the price.  I needed it do a couple of repairs on my son's phone and it had everything we needed.  I'll be using this stuff for other things beside phones.  Very handy kit.
"Great case.  Very high quality and pleased with the purchase.  Only reason it gets four starts instead of five is the bottom of the case has come off the bottom corner of the phone a couple times. It's no big deal, as I can snap it back into place, but I never had this issue with the Magpul case I had for my iPhone 4. Doubt it would completely come off the phone, but don't like how easily it can come off."
Perfect.  Just what we needed.
The only reason this isn't one star is that it is as pictured with colors and worked well while it lasted.  After 3 weeks of use the strap ripped off.
"I was skeptical about this battery because it is cheap. But I went ahead and bought. It took 15-20 days to get to my house. Installation of battery was relatively easy. I installed it in 15 mins. Without any special tools. I used two small screwdrivers (phillips and flat). Once I installed it,  I drain the battery and I charge it full. All I can say is, it works better than my old battery. NFC works just fine. Great buy for my N5."
"Love the case! It feels great when I am using my phone, also keeps my phone from slipping around in my hands. Love the look also."
"Bought This Radio For My Really Close Friend & He Loves It I Love It, Everything About It Is Perfect!"
I loved the case.
This is an awesome amp. If you are just looking for a single amp to power your entire system. I can't imagine any others that perform better.<br /> This is a Class A/B amp and puts out good power with very little distortion.  The class D amps out there are in my opinion a waste of money. The only thing that would make this amp better is if it had a remote bass control. If you have one on your stereo then you are good to go.  I will put this amp up against others costing up to three times the price.
"Works perfectly.  Allows me to have a backup when flying, which is critical."
Excellent idea for young hockey players. Grandson LOVED it. Has it in his room and puts his phone it every night
"Great case, but like many others after only a few months I too had my case crack and break where the silent switch is. Spigen's customer service was very helpful getting a replacement sent out. Let's see how long this one lasts me!"
"Review by English and Korean for overseas direct purchase in Korea.  Have ever you feel Luxury case except iPhone logo? That was good choice. It is so beautiful red color in bumper. Collaborate with Black panel makes more luxury. You know, a little it high price make you stay in placing on order, but  I think it is good price.  But There is just one fault of side bumper. Side bumper is really weak. So I attached tapes before recover it.  슈피겐 제품입니다. 아쉽게도 한국 구매보다 미국이 좀 더 저렴한 아이러니를 가집니다. 그러나 제품은 역시나 최고 입니다.  한국인이 자랑스러울만큼 최고의 제품 퀄리티는 보증하네요. 다만, 이번 제품은 범퍼가 다소 약해서 커플로 구매한 케이스가 모두 못쓰게 되었습니다. 교환 및 할인 구매는 가능하나 시간이 지체되어 받지 못했습니다. 그래도 제품이 정말 이쁩니다. 최고."
Till now everything is alright. I like the phone and the leather.
"The picture on my phone cover came out backwards. The Hayabusa emblem says asubayaH. Also, the cover is to big and will not stay on my phone."
"Very good GPS, fast reliable and with state of the art screen. Now I can see the maps under the extreme sun light."
This charm is incredibly adorable! My cell phone doesn't have a place for a charm so I put it on my 3ds. It it the perfect size. The best part is that it glows in the dark!
Received on date they said it would arrive. I have a moto g 2 gen and i really like this case. The on and off and volume buttons on side of the case works perfect. Not like my old case where the buttons were hard to push. Have had many compliments on this case. Update: the clear case turned dingy yellow after about six months and looked really gross. I tried multiple times to clean it with different cleaners but it didn't help. My advice is you should buy the black one not the clear case.
Excellent product.  I am finally able to charge 3 things at once!
wasn't the right hole for the audio on the back. Suppose be to the left and is on the right side./
"These headphones produce pretty good sound. I have zero complaints there. They block out much other noise so that's good too. BUT, I cannot express to you how much you should NOT buy these if you plan on using them to run or do any other type bouncing type training. The large control on the headphones makes them crazy heavy. They will not stay in my ear all. I have even installed the extra ear canal groove piece.<br />The reason why I gave them 3 stars is because I do ride my bike with them and they seem to work well for that. My suggestion for bluetooth headphones to run or train with is to go with around the ear headphones. They seem to stay in place better. If you buy these I hope they work better for you than me."
Awesome case!  The bling is nice.  Also the case is easy to hold and protects the phone nicely.
"doesn't hold charge, sound is muddy. the sound did improve after a bit of break end but they did not out preform my cheap wired set from jlabs. the only thing i liked about this set was the way they fit but they look and feel cheap"
The plastic is very poorly made. I had it on for a day and the side piece next to the volume broke and the top has cracked.  I have not dropped it or any thing like that just sits in a pouch in my purse so be sure not to bump it on any thing.  Would not recommend this case especially for any type of protection for your phone.
Looks and feels great. The kickstand was not 1 year old proof. My 3 yearold managed to use it just fine. If they would design one without the kickstand i would buy one in every color.
"The Sealed Volume of 2.24 ft.³ isn't a problem for me, to others it could be. The SOUND is detailed and goes low enough to cancel out a need for a Subwoofer. Thanx Morel"
"I hate cases on my iphone so I bought this to help protect the most important thing, the screen! I have dropped my phone several times now and only the glass protector has gotten small cracks, but my screen has stayed intact!."
Just as stated. Love the color!
I am an iOS fan but keep buying Android phone because they are lot inexpensive compared to an iPhone. So I went with XPeria Z3 Compact because it was almost half the price of  iPhone 6 with 64GB. I like the Xperia's design and the looks and it fits to my hand and easy to use. I have been using it for about three weeks now and it is working out well. Of course Android OS is bit confusing but it works. Sometimes the phone runs pretty hot specially I noticed when I am using it while it is being charged. I also noticed that when I was using the Micro USB to charge it takes a long time to charge but when using a Magtron &#34;wireless charger&#34; it is lot quicker. This is in comparison to my previous Galaxy S3 mini.Overall it is a good phone so far.
Really sad I had to rate this like this. .. as I sit here and type from a borrowed phone because mine wasruined from water using this pouch.  it was about my 4th time using it taking my kids to a water park it had been perfect all the other times until this time I did nothing different I have even referred this pouch too many people at the park. not sure what happened but this patch is now costing me a couple hundred dollars. I really wish it had worked.
"This is a universal adapter and charger for when you travel and go to countries which have different wall plugs and you want to charge your own device. I haven't had a chance to actually use it outside of US yet, so I can't comment on the performance in different countries.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Multiple countries supported in one unit<br />- Snug travel case included<br />- 2 USB plugs for charging phones and tablets<br />- Comes with spare fuse<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not really a huge con, but the maximum output is 6A and 100-240V, so you can't charge a lot of devices at once."
It's not the real one I've had both and the real one last me a yea.and third this one only last me a month first off the cut out is diffrent it's not real leather and the clip broke off within one month just go to Crack berry and get the real one people as least you know your getting the real one also the magnet that holds the case shut is a lot smaller on this one other than the real one..
Decent headphones. Great for gym.  Only negative is battery life. Won't enough to get through a few work outs.
"Ultimate comfort BEST sound quality headphones by Nutek...These headphones are very nice, fit is great and give you great sound with noise canceling.  The headphones put out a very nice crisp, clear sound and give a great quality, and a GREAT BIG BANG for YOUR SMALL BUCKS.<br /><br />I got these for myself because I use them at night and listen to the police scanner when I go to bed.  They fit nice and tight without being uncomfortable or hurting my ears.  I feel that the voices on the scanner are nice crisp and clear.  My granddaughter also uses these, but she listens to music on her Iphone. She claims that the sound of her type of music is awesome on them, as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the purchase of these if you are looking for a lot of good sound & fit for a small amount of money.  Great for the young teenagers who ruin or lose them often.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate.  Regardless the opinions found herein are based on my experiences with the product and are 100% my own."
"These are really nice headphones.  The only thing I didn't like about them was that they are a little difficult to get on and off from around your ears.  My dog, Helen Jezzabelle Keller, ate them.  I ordered a pair by Aftershokz because they were cheaper and looked like they'd be a lot easier to slip on and off, which they are, however, I really wish I had just ordered another pair of these instead."
Do not make my mistake this does NOT fit Galaxy S4 Active
"It fits, and does not impede the use it is indeed protective. The hard plastic shell is challenging to clip over the stretchy cover, but can be done. I don't love it, but it clearly will do the job of protecting the phone, and is exactly what is advertised.<br /><br />I would certainly buy from these sellers again."
Does everything you need to keep track ... Yes it's not perfect but great for the price we like them
Great case just took awhile to ship
"I did return this phone but I still give it a 4 star rating. The reason for returning was after using it for a little bit I realized i am really not a windows phone person. I immediately missed my android features. Trying to find comparable apps in the windows store was unsuccessful and i found myself frustrated. The phone was very peppy, sharp and nicely designed. I would definitely suggest getting this phone if you like windows."
"Got here real fast, and was activated without any problem. I had the Sharp Crystal Aquos which is a terrible phone. Real buggy and very limited on what it could do. The Lg g3 has great battery life, and nice large screen, but not uncomfortable, awesome features and very easy to customize. This phone is awesome."
I was looking for some short cords and these work fine.
Its good for when you know you will be away from an outlet to charge your phone. The satnd in the back was broken when i received it. But all in all it works good.
"This mini selfie stick is small compact and works great. it really is about the size on a pen so it is convenient to take along using minimal room. The compact design makes it capable of fitting in a small purse, a pocket, a diaper bag, or just about anywhere. When it is not extended it is about 13 cm long. Extended it can go about two and a half feet including the handle. No Bluetooth needed just plug it into the aux port and put your phone into the adjustable cradle and your ready to take awesome selfies. I love being able to include myself in pics with my kids and friends. I have TONS of pictures, but very few with me in them. Until recently I had never seen or heard of a selfie stick. I am to old to keep up with all the newest gadgets. My sister showed me hers an how to use it in May, since then my selfie sticks are a must have for many occasions. First day of school, birthday parties, and family vacations are all examples of fun times and great memories i have 1,000s of pictures of but sadly I was taking them and not in them. I am now! I have 4 selfie sticks currently. The reason I love this one so much is because I can take it anywhere. It is super easy to use and I do not have to connect to it via Bluetooth every time. One of my other ones I have had for a few months and it connects well at first but loses connection after each pic. This will not be a problem for me now.  Another cool thing is that my kids put their phone in the cradle flip the handle over extend it a little bit and use it as a phone stand to watch videos and play games. The top rotates pretty much anyway you need it to to get that perfect picture. Just turn the little nob move it around and tighten it back up. The part that holds the phone flips all the way around too. This really is a cool little product. It comes in a neat little case that would be easy to wrap up as a gift, though I don't know why anyone would not want to keep it once they seen it in action. It has a little carrying case bag too that comes with it. I really do love how little it is and super simple to use. I received this at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.bag too that comes with it. I really do love how little it is and super simple to use. I received this at a discount for an honest and unbiased review."
"Broken after 3 months, the screw holding the sides together did not hold well, it needs to have something stronger like a nut and bolt to hold it together as the screw is not strong enough.  Very disappointed wasted $20"
"This is extremely cheap and really cute in the picture although when you get it it's very slippery it slips out of your hand and when I put it on my 800$ phone it makes it look very cheap . If you want your iPhone 6 plus to break then buy it. The worst thing is that it takes forever for it to arrive , when it came I totally forgot I ordered it."
"Fits great, I haven't had a problem. Battery life is good and range is decent. Also stays on when I doing my basketball drills."
"Amazing value here folks.<br />I cant say enough good things<br />you need to improvise a little on the translation instructions,<br />But with a little fiddling you can get it<br />The software that you can download from the manual is wonderful and really make this product work good, get GPS module if not included<br />Super value for the feature it offers<br />I strongly recommend you get a hardwire install and locate behind mirror<br />Needs Micro SD card that reads at or beyond 6x,  got a 010x, works fine-32 GB"
"Not big enough for the OtterBox I-phone.  Also, can't open up the little door to plug in earplugs on the bottom."
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this case, because I've always thought otter box cases where really bulky. I am a college student so I do go out a lot and I don't wanna carry a purse all the time. But, this case is really handy! It holds up to 3 cards, or 1 card and cash. I love it for when I'm going out to the bars, because I will just carry my id and some cash, and I'm set. I think its a must buy for college students. because what are we never with out? Our phones! So it carries it all. It was pretty inexpensive for otter box as well. Only $20 plus free prime shipping! I really recommend if you can get over how bulky it is."
iPhone 6 was stuck on recovery mode for weeks after trying to do an update Error 53 popped up because Touch ID was not working. Purchasing this item fixed my entire phone. Thank you.
"Wow. Absoluty fantastic. Installed in 5 mins. Worked a charm, sounds great. Wish I had bought this ages ago."
"I have revised my review - see the bottom.  Original review: This phone's paucity of memory cannot be overlooked.  When I bought it, I thought, 1GB of memory, so what?  It has a memory slot, I'll just add more memory.  So I threw in a 32GB MicroSD card.  Well guess what, you can't install apps anywhere but the onboard memory.  And the OS and built-in non-removable garbage apps take up at least 800MB of that 1GB.  So you can install at best a handful of apps.  Almost unusable. And the phone features - as in making phone calls - are terrible.  Namely, multi-call handling is nonfunctional.  If you're on the phone and receive another call, and take that call, you'll never get back to your original call.  It's gone.  If you try to conference in a second caller, whether it's someone who called in or someone you called, forget it.  Your original caller is, again, gone. Also, the processor speed is pretty terrible.  Probably compounded by the lack of memory. On the plus side, the WiFi calling works well.  New review: By properly rooting the phone, setting up an SD card with dual partitions, and installing Link2SD, I was able to make this phone awesome.  I now have an awesome phone, on the cheap.  But it was not particularly easy.  If you want an awesome phone cheap, get this one and put in the work.  If you want an awesome phone easy, you gotta spend money."
This headset is great.  So easy to use.  I wish the charger cord were longer though.  Aside from that I am very pleased with the bluetooth.
Thank you. My dad was highly satisfied with the case. Thank you so much!
This Bluetooth didnt meet my espectation i can even walk 20 feet from it and it will disconect from my phone the volume is not good and the mic people cant even here you talk other than taking more than a month to diliver this is the wors bluetooth i have ever bought
I was very pleased and would buy from this buyer again. I do recommend this buyer for people with ostomy needs
Charges all my electronics really fast and for some reason is the only micro USB cable that was able to charge my Galaxy S2 while all others would not find the device.
This charging station is awesome highly recommended
"I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The Sony Z3 Screen Protector really is a nice product. The tempered glass is thick and solid, but it doesn't affect the touch features of the phone. It came with everything needed to clean the screen and apply the screen protector. I have to say, I like the Sony Z3 tempered glass screen protector much better than the regular screen protectors. It doesn't leave any air bubbles on the screen, and you can tell just by holding it that it will help prevent scratches and cracks on your phones screen. Very well made, high quality, and I would recommend this product to anyone with one of these phones."
I thought this case had a hinge with a stand that is attached to it. It's actually a slot cut into the case that you put a card into.
"Ordered on July 20, charger died on August 28. Now using the second of the 2 pack. I didn't expect it to die so fast!  The blue light just blinks now and doesn't charge anymore (Blue light is was solid when it charged).  We'll see how long the second lasts. I'm very disappointed in the product.<br /><br />Pros: Looks nice on the outside<br />Cons: Junk on the inside"
This extension for my iPod worked great.  Now i don&#34;t have to take the cover off to use it on my radio.
All 5 cable plug in but barely make contact.  They just connect and if you breath on them they disconnect. They are lose rocking back and forth and the device say connected then discounted. Worse cable ever. This problem happen on 4 different models of kindel tablets and 5 models of cell phones all different brands. So its not the device. Going to throw them a way.  All I can think is a bad batch with the good reviews out there.    Update -- the seller call me by phone and sent me a free replacement set that work great. Will see how they holed up in the long run.
"Perfect fit and function from US Cellular Parts.  I can't say for the other sellers, but the one from US Cellular Parts seems to be legit.  The port is positioned correctly and not recessed, it charges while using, the speakers work, what more can I say, except thank you for saving my N7."
"great cord, no issues yet and my daughter is pretty rough on her phone cords, good quality material, doesn't feel cheap."
"Just finished a 6 mile run with them for the first time and WOW!!! Stayed in perfectly. The buttons are not confusing at all and I was able to take a call without even really knowing what I was doing. (hadnt read the manual yet). The sound is good, haven't really testes out the base yet but for running headphone they are perfect. Almost forgot they have on. I even tried to shake them off and I couldn't. I highly recommend to any runner looking for something to stay on and sound good."
It's great feels great looks great looks like it can be a phone u can put it in your pocket or purse handbag etc. It's a little on the thick side like solid but nothing major it's worth it and the amount of charges are awesome and the flashlight is nice as well.
"Having bought Fosman cables with the LED charging indicators, I decided to buy this pair. The lesser quality of these is glaringly obvious along with the shorter length. The wire is very thin and probably won't last."
very rugged! good product!!
Stylish case.. nice feel to it also
"Works great for iPhone, no for for iPad. Too mutable and requires two hands to undock on nightstand. I ordered two and one of the supplied cables failed in a short amount of time. Will not buy again."
Wasn't able to use the screen protector since it doesn't cover the edge part 😠 i hope to return it back
"Have had this a couple of weeks.  It is holding a charge  pretty well without use.  Have charged my phone from about 30% to full very quickly. It's about the size of my Samsung s5 but I think it is worth it.  Doesn't add too much weight to my bag. Much nicer than carrying my plug and sitting by a plug, especially when traveling."
Couldn't fit my daughter phone when she placed the glass screen on her iPhone 6. I returned the product.
This case is just as expected although the stylist doesn't work as well as just useing my fingers I reall love the case it came earlier then expected and it has a kinda woven texture to it that you can't see in the product photo and the inside is a soft cloth like material.
I like the design very much.  What I don't like is the buckle and how it sticks out.  I may return it to the store because of this issue.
"Great case! It slips on easily and fits like a glove. It covers all the right things (volume/power buttons/all corners) and keeps my other ports (charging/camera/2nd mic) open and accessible. I like the grip it affords me, my phone feels much more secure in my hand. Got it in the frosted clear and I like the color. Can't attest to &#34;dropability&#34; as I fully intend to never drop my phone!"
"Does the job. A little bit on the flimsy side, but works for me."
Pros:<br />Great Rugged Look<br />Feels good in your hand<br />Completely covers the phone<br />Cons:<br />This isn't really a con but I thought it was multiple pieces like other cases but it just one piece that the phone slides into<br /><br />I actually purchased the Samsung Galaxy S5 just so I could get this case. I got one of the UAGs for my wife's iPad and pretty much fell in love with the products.
I wish it would let me rate it something  less than 1 star.  such a p.o.s. light stop working after a week. and it stop holding a charge after couple months.  waste of money. I want. a refund or a new one
"It's clearly made for gaming... I bought it for casual use and realized that it is kind of clunky long when placed in the ears. The sound is sort of shallow sometimes. I needed earbuds to use occasionally when I'm tired of my beats headphones, so for the price its fine and does the job."
"This Galaxy Phone Back is textured like a baseball glove.<br />No Slips during Single handed operation.<br /><br />Bought this again, for my mom"
Pretty good case. The screen protector was not what I thought it was but would be great for someone who is looking for a glass one. The seller quickly helped me fix the screen protector situation.<br /><br />I recommend and am happy with both the product and service!
"I purchased 4 of these, they were great, but we have a charger stand and we can't charge them without removing the cover. It's an inconvenience so we don't use them that often. But they fit great and came way earlier than expected!"
I love the long arm on this holder. It is strong and can reach pretty far. I can use most all my mobile devices with this holder.
If I could give it zero stars I would.<br />It has @ a 12-15 range in my home. By comparison I have a mifi 4510 which is 7 years old and it reaches the whole house and outside with no problem.<br />The 6620l goes dormant randomly (by design according to their help desk tech).<br />To get it to re connect you have to restart it. This is a long and overly complicated process.<br />The 4510 has a button on it. You press it once and it reconnects flawlessly.<br />The 6620l is a terrible &#34;upgrade&#34;.
Nice upgrade from a stock speaker powered by a factory radio. I put them in a 2011 Jetta SE to replace the stock speakers that were terrible. They are loud and very clear with limited distortion it did take a bit of time to break in. To really get the full dynamic range and has a lot of highs and a very nice sound quality. The factory radio equalizer but with a like tuning sound awesome. They would pair well with a subwoofer. I was looking for sound quality and volume this speaker can provide both from a stock radio at a low price. They are a great pair of cheap speakers!
"I bought this because my old phone case for my iPhone 6+ added so much more bulk to an already large and bulky phone and I just wanted out of it. And although I read reviews and people had said there was grippiness on the sides (those black spots between the color), it still isn't very grippy when I'm holding it. It's got this bumpy texture to it, which I guess is what the manufacturer assumed would suffice for the 'grippiness,' but it's just not that great. And there's no rubber on it so that when I set it down, it could easily be knocked off whatever it's sitting on. Also, the lip around the front of the phone doesn't seem like it's enough of a lip at all to protect my phone. Granted, I did drop it on public school carpeting (that really harsh stuff) and it neither damaged my phone nor my case, but I'm afraid of dropping it on something harder than that!  I'm a very clumsy person and have frequently tripped over my other foot and sent whatever is in my hands, FLYING. I just need more of a peace of mind that my stuff is safe in my hands. I will say the color is beautiful and true to what was posted."
"Excellent product. I wanted the red to be a little darker, but I'm good with it. And the pen is an extra plus."
"I have an iPhone 5 and this doesn't work.  My husband plugged it into his iPhone 6 and it works fine.  So I plugged it into my work iphone 5 and it didn't work.  So the only thing we can conclude is it only works with newer phones, even though Apple says they are the same.  So my husband has a new cord that he likes."
Great headset. Pairs up quickly with mobile phones. I actually purchased it to use with a bluetooth enabled laptop. It paired easily but didn't work at all as a mic or speaker with the computer due to driver / software issues on the laptop. The fix was not an easy process; however it had nothing to do with the headset. After a couple of hours on the Dell support site upgrading and patching bluetooth and sound software (I think it was the wireless docking station upgrade that did the trick) it finally worked appropriately. I can now use it to record / narrate my class lectures for my students to use online.
"Very smooth. If you are looking for a case that is rubbery and grippy, this is not the case for you. Fits phone very tight and seems to provide good protection."
"Worked perfectly, and suited my needs. Definitely recommend if you are in need of a replacement cord!"
Does exactly what it is meant to do. Adds a little bit of a bulk but great protection. Kickstand is a nice feature but I rarely see myself using it. Not my first Spigen case and certainly not my last.
Used it on a kayak trip and at the beach in the water and it kept my phone dry.
"Love this charger, super fast charging. Even has a light to see to connect to your phone."
"It got a good share of giggles and &#34;oh cool&#34;s at parties, but eventually the opener kept sliding out when I didn't want it to. It's a beefy case, that feels secure, but the &#34;jack in the box&#34; opener that kept popping out when I didn't want it to, got old fast."
"I've been using this battery for just 3 days so far, but very satisfied and happy with this choice. This is my second Anker battery - the first one was for a Toshiba laptop, and has been great so far (used it for a month only, so things can change). Anker seems to have a more professional approach than most battery-manufacturers available on Amazon - they have customer support, good packaging, 18 months warranty. All of which suggests they stand behind their product far more than others.<br /><br />Before deciding to give a try to Anker, I did extensive research on all the other batteries available. There were just too many inconsistencies in reported quality with others. Anker didn't disappoint.<br /><br />If the 2-year old Samsung OEM battery (made in Korea) was lasting for only half a day, then Anker seems to last for over a day - just like the OEM battery did 2 years ago. Will see how long will this persist. Anker says their battery is for 500 charge cycles, which is roughly 18 months."
Great case.  Has held up well and I've gotten many compliments on it.
I trust OtterBox Brand and this smartphone case does the job of both protection and style. Easy to use and fits well.
"This is so much fun that I don't know why I didn't get one ages ago!<br /><br />I did receive this Selfie Stick at a discount for my unbiased review. Everything here is my own opinion and I was not coached, coerced, or coaxed by anyone.<br /><br />The Xsarmor Perfect Selfie Stick is what it says it is, the PERFECT Selfie Stick. Once the box was opened and it was paired to my Galaxy S4 mini, it was easy to use. I will say that the instructions were simple and easy to follow for someone that doesn't have a lot of experience with Bluetooth. The instructions said that &#34;Easypro&#34; will come up on the Bluetooth pairing but my device came up with &#34;JY-ZP004&#34;. Not really anything big, just something for the novice to be aware of.<br /><br />The spring on the stick is very tight, has a non-slip portion, and I have no concerns at all that my phone (in the Otterbox case) will drop. It folds up small and compact. Very easy to fit into a purse (7 1/2 inches by 1 3/4 inches). The Gold accenting makes it distinguishable from others and/or easy to find in my overloaded purse.<br /><br />It was very simple to use. Once your phone is on the camera setting, just press the button at the end of the stick and voila!, it snaps a picture for you.<br /><br />I haven't charged it yet. According to the directions it takes about 30 minutes to charge. Since it comes with a standard micro-USB adapter for charging, I can use the cord with my Galaxy S4 mini as well.<br /><br />The Perfect Selfie Stick also comes with a strap. Which is great because I'd hate to drop it or my phone if it was jostled.<br /><br />For the price and quality I was thinking it'd make a great stocking stuffer gift as Christmas will be here before you know it. Or perhaps a birthday present as my family has a lot of birthdays in November before Thanksgiving.<br /><br />This is a high quality Selfie Stick and I'm happy to give it 5 stars."
very nice quick charge<br />but I thank it's not 13000mAh charge my mobile note 4 3 times.<br />also cable with it low quality
HAD TO MODIFY THE UNIT TO FIT MY 2015 LEGACY. WORKS WELL NOW.<br />IF WOU DON'T HAVE WIDE VANES IN YOUR CAR VENTS IT WILL SNAP RIGHT INTO PLACE.<br />WORKS WELL NOW THAT I MODIFIED IT.
"The new *Up bands are completely useless.  I got my new up just last week and it has already come off now less then 20 times and I am not even that active of a person.  It came off 6 times at the mall, 4 times while sleeping, 5 times while getting ready to go to work, twice while driving my car 3 times while watching tv, and twice while walking the dogs.  I know these numbers because after the third time it hit the floor at the mall the first day I wore it I started keeping count.  This is the most rediculous problem for an activity tracker to have.  I do not feel comfortable wearing it for daily errands let alone for an intense hike or run for fear of loosing it.  The Up 24 band was solid and NEVER came off unintentionally once in the 8 months that I had been wearing it.  Do not waste your time and money on such a useless tracker.  The program itself does its job but what is the point when you wont have a band after a week."
This is made better than my last purchase. I can carry more cards in this one than my other. Like the strap that is optional.
I like it. My little clips keep coming off. Please consider making the clips metal with felt lining. They may stay on better. My calls sometimes can't here me and I cant here them. Clarity.
Don't do it.  Mast is way too flexible and the fit is poor.  There are other products that better fit the need.
"First off, when I received this item a while back, it was not the same color as it shows in the picture. Secondly, it took a little time to get the case loosened up so my iPod would fit correctly. Last but not least, the front of the case has opened up and now it is no longer waterproof. Dissatisfied."
Order filled promptly. Great product.  Highly recommend these are much better than rubber tips. Replacement of tips is easier and more secure.
"Life changer. Now my license, credit card, etc. is easy. no more out of alignment hip bones."
"I purchased this to hopefully replace my phone case and wallet into this one case.  I looks great and I started putting my items into it and ran into a couple of concerns.  The first concern was that the photo ID area wouldn't show the entire drivers license and the other is once I put 3 credit cards, my license and a medical card it wouldn't close all the way.  I will keep this for when I am going on business trips and need to carry extra business cards which will be perfect for this case."
Lighter works without heating your phone up. Feels kind of cheap and I didn't take in for account how thick it would make the iPhone 6 feel. Good if you don't drop the phone.
Kind of a cool case especially for the price.  The removable front wheel over the Ringer / Vibrate button broke after the first day.
This is the best mini camera I have ordered to date. Made with real tough metal and has a more realistic feel for operation. I have not tried the night vision and really don't need it. It works well for my needs and the price is right.
"I have had the case for a few days now.  Very high quality.  I like the leather look and the fact that it protects the phone even where the window is located.  Fits very snug and secure as well.  I have several cases for my Galaxy S6, some that are more expensive than this one, but this one has the best fit and build quality, even though it is less expensive.  I highly recommend it.  Great quality and great price."
"I would like to give a 5 star, but I've only used the Jackery once.  I purchased it as a gift for my partner who had ordered something similar but was sorely disappointed.  That product didn't even charge her cell phone once. Someone told me about the Jackery so I looked it up and decided to purchase it. I had it in 2 days. After charging the Jackery we tried it out. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it charged both the Galaxy S4 phone and her Kindle Fire HD."
Absolutely love this case. I gage a gold phone and the gold case matches perfectly. Have dropped phone few times already and the case did its job. Highly recommended
works well. I like the hands free phone feature.
"Glass screen protector was easily installed! I usually will go to my local tmobile store and have them put it on but I said screw it and installed it myself and it turned out great, it came with instructions to install and it was very helpful! The glass has a very glossy look to it but it's exactly what I wanted! My last screen protector I had was plastic and foggy that I got from a tmobile store and it didn't look HD, with my new amFilm glass screen protector on I get the nice HD look the LG G4 is supposed to have, great screen protector! I highly recommend this screen protector to anyone!"
This works great! I use it in my vehicle with my phone. It's just like having Bluetooth in my truck.
"Wish there wasn't the bright blue light that happened with this.  It's nice so you know things are charging, but if you like a dark room for sleeping it's not great."
"I wanted the belt clip for using my phone while running and going to the gym, however, you can't plug in your earphones while the phone is holstered. Bad design. It's a nice case combo though, just wished they would have thought of that."
Love my spec case. I have dropped my phone so many times with my spec case on it really protected my phone.
Its okay you get what you pay for. Hard to hear and people can't hear 4th you. Have to charge more often than suggested.
"Excellent  sound quality from infinity ALWAYS. Running 2 sets of infinity speakers through seperate amp and subs through another, Sound is crisp and clean. You Cant go wrong buying this brand"
"This is the future of entertainment. Strap on a headset and enjoy video immersion. Consumer-level VR, however, is still in its infancy... these headsets are only able to offer a glimpse of what that future will hold. The VUE Series goggles from IncrediSonic are a good introduction -- They're a great step-up from the ubiquitous low-cost cardboard viewers designed by Google. The build quality is very nice; the three-way strap holds it securely to your head and the lenses provide a clear 3D image from even the smaller screen of the iPhone 5.<br /><br />The head-straps make for comfortable viewing; just don't neglect the included nose-pads! Without them, I found myself needing to use my hands to take the pressure of the headset off the bridge of my nose. This distracted from the VR experience. Even padded, the nose area isn't perfect; I'll likely have to rig up something softer for longer viewing sessions. The face-padding, though, is very effective and also works as a seal to keep out ambient light.<br /><br />Loading the viewer is simple; just pull the front lid-flap forward and center your phone on the foam circle. There is also an insertable bracket you can use to ensure the phone is placed in the correct location. The lid snaps securely back into place thanks to a magnetic closure system. Very well designed.<br /><br />I deducted one star from my rating because the nose area could be more comfortable and also the instructions for the Bluetooth remote are difficult to understand. It's frustrating when manufacturers spend the money to put together a great product, but don't put enough investment toward proper translation of their manuals, guides, etc.<br /><br />Finally, here are some iOS apps I found that offer a good VR experience:<br /><br />Discovery VR<br />Legendary VR<br />VRSE<br />inVR<br />InMind VR<br />Dreamizer 3D VR<br />VR Sniper<br />Mobile VR Station (use to view photos/play videos on your phone)<br /><br />I received an evaluation unit at a discounted price in exchange for sharing my opinion.elpful, please do me a favor and click the &#34;Yes&#34; button below. Thank you!"
"I was worried about the mixed reviews, but still gave this case a chance. It gives JUST enough grip and bulk to the iphone 6 to make me feel more secure handling it. There are &#34;lips/ridges&#34; when placing the phone down on each side to keeps screens/lenses from touching surfaces. The  buttons are easy to push and all of the cutouts line up perfectly. I have no complaints and would buy again."
This is a great case. It works wonderfully and is very easy to put on. The colors are just like the ones in the pictures and I love it. I gave it four stars because the screen protector that came with it no matter what I did there were still bubbles in it. Overall though a very nice product and I would definitely recommend it. It also seems very well-made.<br /><br />I did receive this product for free or at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and that is what I've given you today.
It's probably one of the most comfortable armbands I've<br />used for iPod/iPhone's.  It fits my 5s perfectly.  Highly<br />recommend it!
"Great to have, just wish the unit itself plugged into an outlet.  And it doesn't seem to tell you when battery is fully charged so I just leave it on for no more then 2 hours."
"Performance is great when streaming audio.  The phone performance has been the glitchy issue.  Calls don't always sound good and people sometime have a hard time hearing me.  Sometimes the unit glitches on my end and the voice of whoever I'm speaking to gets garbled for about 30 seconds than sometimes returns to normal, sometimes not - which forces me to either end the call or go off hands free.  I know some of the issues might be better resolved by finding the &#34;right&#34; FM station in my area with the least interference.  Trouble is I travel a lot all over the area in at least a 75 mile radius so good station frequency choices in one area might not work well as I travel to another.  Doesn't seem to impact the music as much as the voice though.  Still trying to figure out why.  If you're just looking for something to retrofit an older car without bluetooth or aux in capabilities just for music, look no further.  If voice is important, you may want to read more reviews or look at other products."
The best and easy to use headphones I have ever purchased the sound is awesome and they stay in trough the entire workout. A must buy
It was entirely too big for my arm. And I'm not a small person.I didn't waste time sendIng I t back. I just gave it to my grandson.💪🏾
Visually it looks great. The belt clip is not solid and broke and clip holding phone broke. At the point where they move plastic is thin and weak. Was disciplined cause the overall design was great.
"Fits my Nikon d600 snugly, good purchase."
"yep, works perfect for my samsung."
"I love this selfie stick! It has great size and great construction. The camera button in particular is very well constructed - that is very important as I have used selfie sticks before where the camera button does not take the picture right away when you press it and it requires multiple presses. For this stick, the picture is taken without any issues as soon as you press the camera button. It also compresses to a very small and convenient size. I usually carry around a small cross body bag and this selfie stick is compact enough to fit inside while still leaving me room to put other items in my bag. But don't let the compact size fool you - the stick extends really far allowing you to capture a lot of background scenery in your picture. Lastly, my phone felt secure at all times unlike other sticks that can be a bit wobbly. Overall definitely a great buy and I would recommend it to others."
The print is a bit distorted and not vibrant. It definitely doesn't look like the photo.
This was horrible.  The disc that came with it was the tiny kind and the label coming apart in my hand.  The software would not load and when I tried to download the same company's version online ( I found out later)  my computer would have crashed if I had chosen to install. Not sure what product I can buy to read old phone cards but if someone knows of a good one please recommend.
Exactly what one would expect from the description. Comfortable and stays in place.
"Great phone in it's time (OK,the model is 4-5 years old) but as the price drops (I paid $75 this time around) it is still better value than any brand new models in the price range. Great camera with flash (macro and long range shooting) and it is 4G capable... features that are not available on any one, new model costing less than $100 these days. Plus there are all kinds of accessories that were built specifically for this phone that are dirt cheap these days."
"This is a very good product, I would recommend buying this to other customers. I have an Incipio phone case on my S6 and it works great. I ONLY gave four stars because if you workout HARD CORE to get BUFF like me!!! It tends to get in the way every once in awhile, but not enough to be annoying so I put it on my forearm instead of my bicep; this my just be because the phone is so large though. Hope this review helps you for your purchase, thanks!"
'Clear' case had a yellow tinge. Functionally good. Would have been 5 starts if completely transparent.
"I usually don't write reviews but this one is an exception. My phone fell 30 ft underwater and stayed there for about 24 hours overnight. Long story short, my phone is still working because of this waterproof case. The material is great and kept my phone dry. Only downfall was the strap broke off from the case. Other than that, I highly recommend it."
Upgraded from a Samsung galaxy victory and this thing blows it away. Love the UI. Great price too. My only complaint is it is just a wee bit too big. It's a phablet for sure.
First off it does what it's supposed to do. Protect the phone and damn it protects it for sure. However it does add quite a bit of bulk to the phone. And once you put it on good luck getting it off. Probably one of the hardest cases I've had to take off. All in all its a good case for the money and it protects it very well.
"These stylus pens are just too great for words. They have these little plastic lines on the ends that plug into the 3.5 jack space, when you are not using earbuds, that keeps the stylus pen always available. Plus there are six pens of different colors in this draw-string bag. I also bought the case of 15 replacement rubber tips and the pens and the replacement tips all fit into the draw-string bag. Cool!"
Its amazing. I have gone in a pool with it and dropped it off ladders multiple times and its still fine. Only down side is that my phone calls get muffled so I have to leave it on speaker phone during calls
"Great idea, but terrible sound and reception. It is almost unusable. A purchaser should only buy this if they are first and foremost worried about breaking the phone. Otherwise the loss in audible understanding by the phone call recipient is simply too much to endure. It sounds like you are talking from the bottom of a deep hole.<br /><br />Feels better than most protective cases, but lacks in ability to discern the voice of the caller.<br /><br />Good try, but needs a better microphone to transmit the voice."
on the side where there were openings for the volume buttons broke off and the paint chipped but for teh time it lasted it was a great case
"I sent it back. It did not work with my Iphone 4s. I am waiting for a refund. I sent it backJuly 7, 2015. I still have the receipt."
"Love the case. It's super cute and love that it's a dual case. It actually feels like it will protect my phone. Love that it has the lip that covers the edge so it protects it all the way around. The only thing I don't like is that the first layer pushes my screen protector in, cause it to peel. So I may just need to find a different screen protector. Other than that, I love it and I'm very happy with it"
"This case is really nice. It fits perfectly on the Galaxy Note 5 and does not make it bulky. All cutouts are exactly where it needs to be. Although the earphone jack will only fit the narrow end earphones (ex: earphones supplied with the phone) and auxiliary jacks. I have no probem removing the stylis. Since it is a tight fit it may be a little difficult removing the case but I see no reason to do so any time soon. The silver edge is not metal as I thought, instead it's plastic. The back part is a thin rubber that looks and feels good and I believe it should protect the phone. I like that it has raised edging on the face of the phone. This protects the phone if it is placed screen down. Overall, it is a great case that will protect my phone and it was at a very low price."
Hardly used and poor connection noted. Need to pull it in and out and also twist it some to get it to connect. Then connection goes away at times without even touching it. Do no recommend buying this.
"Great looking case, it's a little slippery to hold but shows my phone off great."
"The fit and look of this case are exactly what I had been searching for. I needed something to give me a little scratch protection, but not cover up the design of the phone. I usually do not use a case on a phone, but after a couple of fumbles decided to try something minimal.<br /><br />The case looks and feels amazing on the iPhone 6 plus. It makes the phone easier to grip and use. The quality and fit are top notch as is the support. I had a small problem with a tear at the bottom of the case and the company has agreed to replace it promptly.<br /><br />This case does not protect the screen but if you are looking for a case that will enhance your phone without covering up the design then this is the one to go with."
The case is too thick you really can't text and hard to turn my phone up or down. Buttons to hard on the side
Clear voice quality. Amazing for a refurbished item.  Legitimately last 7 hours.  I listen of podcasts all day with about what hours of phone calls a day. I haven't killed it yet.
"Phone case fits my iPhone 5s great! I love the color scheme and the ease in which I put it together. The description indicates it is ultra slim, and I have to agree. With this case on it still fits in my back pocket and in the small pocket on the side of my purse. I would recommend this to a friend looking for a new phone case. This case however does not seem like it would protect the phone very well if dropped on a hard surface or into water.... And I'm not going to try this to verify 😊<br /><br />I purchased this product for a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion."
Love this car mount
I do obstacles races where mud and water are always there.  This case keep my phone clean and safe.
"The product was good, the capacity is amazing, quickly charges and stuff, only thing is i thought it would be small, and somewhat light, but then again its a 13000 mAh so thts expected."
I was very satisfied with this case. It fit securely and looks very nice and sleek with great protection.
Was good then someone loud talked to me blew speaker now scratchy thinking speaker not same quality as other bluparrot bletooth products
"This only lasted a few weeks, but it was great few weeks!"
"The shower mate Bluetooth speaker is a really fun speaker. You can use it just about anywhere and you can even answer phone calls while taking a shower!  I don't really get many phone calls and I usually take my showers at night after the kids have all gone to bed so I didn't set this up in my shower. It does have a nice suction cup on the back of it that makes it easy to suction anywhere, I chose to suction it to my fridge and listen to Pandora radio via my phone while washing the dishes. The speaker is easy to charge; you can connect it to any USB power station or laptop to efficiently charge it. The buttons have a sticker over the top of them that provide you with the directions on what each button is for because they have the functionality to do two different things depending on if you're on the phone or listening to music. The speaker was loud enough and the sound quality was great for my use. You could hear the speaker in my back bedroom and my front living room; the kitchen is sort of in the middle.<br />It comes in a nice little box that would be nice for giving as a gift. It's easy to pair and easy to use and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves singing in the shower or having their music with them anywhere in their house.<br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion; these thoughts are completely my own. No compensation was given for writing this review or providing a rating."
"works well but has to large tip for tablet. currently looking fo replacement stylus for my lg8 android, but cant find factory replacement"
GREAT CASE and AWESOME CUsToMER SERVICE ... but seriously this case was much better than I expected for the price
"This is the perfect case for those who really don't like cases but want to protect their phone from scratches or cracks from dropping it. It's completely clear, fits like it was made by Apple, protects how you want but hardly changes the weight or size of your phone. I love it!"
Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
"Fast shipping on great case for no frills cell phone. No instructions with it, but you can figure it out..."
"Bought this for a trip with my husband to the Grand Canyon. Once we figured out how to take pictures with out our arm in it, we got great pictures. My husband also used it to get pictures over the edge of canyon without getting to close."
"Just tried these for the first time today and they worked beautifully. I'm a woman (5'6, 130 pounds) and have tiny ears so I always have problems with headphones fitting or earbuds falling out of my ears when I run; I was worried about these fitting properly, especially since the ear pieces are one size only. I just did 2 miles today but had no problems with the headphones slipping or discomfort. In fact, I thought they were amazingly comfortable with good sound quality. My husband agrees and I'll be purchasing another pair for him."
"Great charger.  Charge easily lasts for a week of travel, charging two iPhones multiple times and keeping them charged during full days of photographing and Facebooking.  Would have given it 5 stars, but it can be a little temperamental about re-charging.  You have to get just the right charger and cord.  And you can't always tell that it didn't charge, because the only indicators are four little tiny lights that you have to interpret what their blinking or not-blinking means."
this is one have a good and fast results
"Bought this case for my work phone, not wanting to spend a bunch of money.  Works very good.  protects it well.  I have no issues at all with it.  The kickstand is handy when watching video clips or movies and the glow-in-the-dark is a fun bonus.  If you want an inexpensive case (I get sick of paying all the money for Otter Box) that does the trick, check this one out.  With the rubber cushion/protection, it should hold up for any abuse you can throw at it!"
These are made by Irulu for the Irulu tablet and are bigger than the tablet. You have to cut and modify them. I would expect them to be an exact fit.
"I bought this for my husband and it's not as bulky as the previous defender series. My husband is a huge colts fan. I swear by these cases, because my husband dropped his phone in a humvee and it had no scratch."
Am very satisfied. High quality product.
Sturdy & does the job. I like the kick stand on the phone case so you can stand it upright or on it's side. Great buy for the money. Much better than cases I spent a lot more for.
"This Letouch Power Stone II power bank is nicely sized for its 8400mAh capacity -- about 3.8 inches long, 2.4 inches wide, about 1 inch thick, and weighs in at 7.2 ounces (per our postal scale). It seems to be a quality build, including a silicone exterior protective cover.<br /><br />Interesting looking lego-like design; this is a portable 8400 mAh power bank with two USB power ports. However, there is no detail in the specifications on the max output of any given port, so let's assume it is around 2A. Since the max flow of this unit is 2.1A, if you have a high drain device connected to the battery that requires a 2A flow, there would be just 0.1A remaining available for a device connected to the second port.<br /><br />If you put both ports to use at one time, connecting devices requiring at least 1A, the average distribution would be about 1.05A... marginally better than your typical 1A wall charger.<br /><br />Confirming this, the charge rates for the devices we plugged into it (HTC Droid DNA, and Samsung Galaxy S3) experienced a rate of charge similar to what we typically get from their 1A OEM chargers. Our typical charge rate was about 1/2% per minute (1% every two minutes, or about 30% per hour).<br /><br />The Amazon listing notes that this unit is covered by a 1 year warranty, so if an issue occurs within that period of time we would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
Great case for the price. Strong and sturdy. You can not go wrong.
Great value. Light and provides realistic protection.
"I was really excited to receive my car mount. It was incredibly easy to install. I was actually amazed at how easy it was and I realized why when I went to use it. It doesn't stay auctioned to any surface. It's basically just a phone holder that falls off while you drive, making it dangerous to have in your car. So disappointed."
"These are awful! After waiting over a month, they all quit working after a couple of uses. Pure crap."
this case SUCKED I had the blue elephant one & I REALLY DO NOT recommend it didn't even hug my phone right . I was so mad . but for some reason my friend wanted it so I have it away w/ out even using it or taking pictures.
"Very nice quality, but it would only cover just the screen part of my phone and not the sides on my phone after the screen which I didn't like. I also had problems pressing the back touch button on my phone because the case was to thick. I ended up taking it off and using a thinner protector."
Very well built case. My only issue is that the phone will only slide in the case face down. It would make accessibility more convenient if the device could slide in facing out.
"The jawbone strap for the Up Move is just one big disappointment and huge design flaw.<br />I've almost lost my up move on several occasions due to the design of the strap.<br />The strap does not hold on well.<br />What has kept me from losing my up move is that it does have a tracker on the device therefore I always keep my bluetooth turned on so that if I do happen to notice that the ban has fallen off I am able to track my item.<br />I do like how the band fits onto the wrist, I also like the slimness and the various colors ( I have red) however Jawbone needs to go back to the drawing board and fix the design of the band."
Perfect..love built in screen protection
"Perfect!  That is, if you have a giant wrist.  I don't think the R and D team know what ergonomic is.  The face is too long and flat, causing it to stick out on either side of the wrist. The band fastens in such a way that it limits any up and down motion of the wrist.  And the text cannot be viewed in portrait, only landscape, which is quite unnatural."
"I just recently ordered the Studio 7.0 phone by the miami based cellular phone company BLU,and I have one word to describe this phone : Fantastic!! I've read all the complaints made by people on this site who SUPPOSEDLY ORDERED this phone and gave horrible reviews due to there lack of computer knowledge and I realized two things : They either dont know how to use a cellphone or they are just plain vacuous on working a 7 inch electronic item. The phone itself works extremely fast , loading time is good and I watch netflix on my phone as well..... I hear people complain about the phone shutting off or not staying lit for long periods of time, for the phone novices who dont know any better go into your phone settings where it states DISPLAY turn daydream mode OFF AND PLACE SLEEP MODE on your phone ON THE SETTINGS which say NEVER instead of the phone being on a time cycle ( It  has start times that begin at 15 seconds and end at  30 minutes) . I really dont have any negative input about the worlds first 7 inch cellphone, I even dropped it by accident and it still works 100% PERFECT. The only drawback on this beautiful piece of hardware( BLU studio phone) is the battery time. I can get at most about 6 to 7 hours of talktime which I guess is decent . I do a LOT OF TALKING and I just thought the battery would be a little stronger. I assume with the next model of BLU studio 7.0 phones the battery will be more powerful and I will be there tp PURCHASE IT. All in all no complaints here on my 7 inch BLU phone........"
"I've bought this thing twice, once for each car.  It works as expected, although not as aesthetically pleasing as a non-Garmin mount which I bought many years ago and still would be using if I had not managed to break it.  The base seems a bit sticky, which helps keep it in place, although it has never fallen from the dashboard.  I can't say that about my old aesthetically pleasing one, but then I had it for so much longer."
I love this phone cover!  It see solid and my phone feels so safe.  I've already dropped it a few times with no issues.  It looks and feels like real wood - so classic!
The front screen is great the body wrap is very hard to put on and does not stay in place. A back only piece would be so much better.
"This phone case is absolutely gorgeous. I have 3 cards on the inside and keep some cash in the outside zippered pocket, and it works great. It's not that easy to take the phone out of the case once it's put in, but that's okay considering I got the case to protect the phone. I just won't be able to switch to any other case, which is great for the maker! But since this case looks so great and has made my life so much easier since I no longer have to bring a wallet around, I have no problem keeping my phone in this case."
I like it but it broke on the first week I got it.<br />And the ballerinas dress also got dirty easily .<br />Plus it will break if it falls on the floor .
If you want a good cheap smartwatch this is a good option I wouldn't recommend if you have an Iphone it doesn't have as many features
"Works like it should. Just wish the charge light was a bit brighter. You really can't see it during the day. It's a minor quibble though. Otherwise, it's well built. Should last pretty much forever."
Really difficult to use and so therefore wound up not being able to use it at all.  Couldn't open it while my phone was in the case.  It's a shame because for a phone case it wasn't cheap and I used to love my old wallet case.  Huge disappointment.
The watch is nice looking seems to be well built. It does just what it promised to do. However I have had an issue with charging it since new and after contacting Pebble a week ago have still not had a resolution to this problem.
"Excellent screen protectors! When they indicate HD quality and crystal clear, this is the TRUTH! We use these for all our Apple products, they fit perfectly and are easy to install! As you can see in my attached photo, you can barely tell the screen protector is there!! Thanks so much for the great, quality product!"
"A little difficult finding that exact spot to charge,but charges well. Make sure that your phone has a qi adapter installed.easy to do<br />Inexpensive to purchase to.purchase  easy to<br />Install. Don't be fooled as I was check your phone make sure it has the q I adapter."
"Fits my S5 perfectly, yes it does add a little bulk, but i am able to use my existing case with it (snug, but fits - Tech21 Case For a Samsung Galaxy S5). theres no difference in the look or line up of buttons, I am very much a happy camper"
"Great solution for desktop, night stand, or kitchen counter to keep you phone plugged in for charging and at a perfect and stable angle for tracking incoming emails, texts, and messages.  Light weight and very strong. Just what I was looking for as a phone stand."
I like it the only thing I don't like is you can't charge your phone with the case on it.
LOve it!  The colour is so girly!!
"This 4 foot long cable works perfectly with our daughter's iPhone 5c and our son's iPhone 6 (4.7).<br /><br />It was delivered right on time and in perfect condition. Nice fit on both, and it feel substantially built especially in comparison to the thinner plastic cables we have had. Even works just fine with the cases both have on their phones.<br /><br />If you are looking for a high quality, Apple certified, 4 foot long lightning cable for your Apple equipment, based on our kids' experience with this one we highly recommend trying this Letouch product.<br /><br />Excellent trouble-free cable so far.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller, without obligation, and have decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing review reflect that testing experience."
"Broke on the second day, the clip came undone when I was prying the phone holder jaws open to put the phone in, and it fell off windshield and left suction cup on windshield."
"I keep this charger at work so I can charge my watch in the middle of the day (I use some more battery-intensive features). It works well and charges quickly.<br /><br />It does heat the watch much warmer than the original charger does, though it's not too warm to wear."
"only used it once,worked as advertised. Easy to pair and sound was very good."
sounds good
"The cables are well made, but the cord is very stiff. I had hoped the grippy hooks that keep it plugged in would hold up better than other cables, but they have not. Either the design of the micro USB on my HTC one is bad, or the entire micro USB design is too fragile. Within a month or two of daily use, every cable loses its ability to stay firmly plugged in."
took 1 hour to install when done it had a blemish on the corner. started failing within 12 hours completely failed within 18 hours.<br /><br />sent feedback with no response this product was junk and a waste of my time.
Of all of the after market bands I have purchased this was by far the most elegant.  All others were too big and clunky for my wrist.
"Makes life so much easier. Yes it needs to be plugged in, but your device doesn't."
"This speaker is amazing. It's tiny, has a cool startup message, and has modern lights that catches the eye. All my friends love the sleek design! Definitely worth the buy!"
This was a gift for Mr 17. He was thrilled and it perfectly fitted his phone
works with everyone of my friends s6 and s6 edge that comes to my house! no setup needed! Super quick shipping too
Works exactly as advertised. I had to go purchase longer screws since hte side wall on my motor home is thicker than the lenght of the screw provided. Very happy with the reception.
"The light on this is super powerful and we use this to charge our phones and iPads. Works really well but it is a bit larger and heavy. Not something you would throw in a purse, bit more for a back pack. We do love that my husband and I can use it at the same time."
It worked really well and fit great. Until the kickstand broke. About a month after I got it.
Great assortment of cases. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cases for the price.
"It seems sensitive to the position of my smartphone in relation to this device.  Facing certain ways will cut out the signal, and this is only 15 feet away.  Overall, it has spotty reception."
"Excited to receive this stand I quickly pulled it out and checked it out.  Here is what I found:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Comes packaged in a gift-giving box (clean and simple design)<br />Stand matches the iMac brushed aluminum<br />Parts that touch your watch and phone are protected with a silicone substance (no scratching)<br />Watch charger fits in snugly, no worry about it falling out<br />Can remove plastic off the 4-cushions on the bottom to secure in place<br /><br />CONs:<br />No cable management<br />Not enough room under the phone for the lightning cable (the cable push the phone up off the stand<br /><br />Overall, I like it but wish it had more room under the phone (1/8 inch would do it) as well as I prefer some sort of means to keep the charging cables under control.  Not a deal breaker, as it seems most stands do not offer cable management.<br /><br />This stand was provided at a discount for the purpose of review."
"Bought for under$2.  Holds the watch pretty good, not great ( the dangling watch strap can pop the watch off the holder if not placed perfectly.) design could be improved, stress is put on the charging cable if you pop it into the designed cable channel..it's worth the $2 I spent. EDIT 9/17/15 i've dropped my review to one star, I stand by my review on the original product (single watch stand, not the combo watch/phone stand).  My problem is with whoever is selling the product..they've used my review on another of their products without my permission, they've listed me as a verified purchaser of this other product (INSANE Combo dock) without me ever purchasing or receiving said product.  I feel this is review fraud as my review shows up the same for two different products.  I have only seen and used the single watch stand, this product is satisfactory for the money i spent..  if you see my review under this product, it's safe to say I can vouch for it.  If you see this under &#34;INSANE watch combo&#34; or any other product, please consider it fraud, and I would hesitate to trust other reviews on these products.  I've notified amazon about this and have not heard back in over a week, I'm assuming they are aware of this kind of fraud but don't want to alarm the masses.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN REVIEW FRAUD, i feel I have been taken advantage of and this leads me to assume i've been reading false &#34;verified purchaser&#34; reviews on amazon in the past."
Case fits perfect and the built in screen protector is clear and smooth. If your looking for good protection without bulk this case is what you want.
"Great durable and reliable device. I have first got this product a few months ago and boy has it saved my phone many times. Plus the added solar charging actually works very well and isn't a gimmick if you work or live in an environment with a lot of sun.<br /><br /> Plus its so easy to setup. All you need to do is plug in the device and cable and you are ready to go. The 6000mah helps me charge my phone 4x from dead, and plus charge a few other items as well.<br /><br /> I have dropped the battery pack hundreds of times and threw it in my bags suitcases and whatnot, and it has never broke nor showed any give whatsoever.<br /><br /> I would recommend this battery pack to anyone looking for an affordable, durable and easy to use battery pack and would definitely continue to support zerolemon in the future."
This is a nice looking phone case that fits the phone well. My only complaint is the red plastic sections have small cracks. They don't seem to affect the operation of the case but I'm afraid they will get worse.
This is a nice case but you r getting what u pay for. The case that holds your phone is not secured to the wallet and mine has already come apart
Quality not so good. Material is too thick and hinders fingerprint from sensor. Registering fingerprint helps but still awkward.<br /><br />Cheap feel. Regret purchase.
Dropped my phone and the screen cracked.  All this is good for is for preventing scratches on the back and showing the custom backing I ordered for the phone (which I'm now regretting)
"Just what I needed,  tested it out by dunking it in the lake case worked great"
"I cannot fathom how someone could give this a negative review UNLESS they didn't take the time to understand what it IS and what it ISN'T.<br /><br />It IS a two-way messaging system using the global satellite system. That means you can send and receive messages from anywhere in the world. It IS a GPS that can use preloaded waypoints and routes to help you safely navigate. It has a secure SOS button that will dispatch emergency help if you activate it!!!  It's a compass and a barometer, too.<br /><br />It is NOT a GPS that you can load topo's up into. It isn't meant to be that. It doesn't come preloaded with maps. Again, it's not meant to be that.<br /><br />You DO have to buy a subscription to send and receive messages. For $35 a month you can send/receive 40 texts. For $60 you can send/receive unlimited. You can pay by the month with no long term subscription required. If you have a remote understanding of how meaningful this device is you would understand that this is CHEAP for the value it brings. Avid backpackers have been waiting a long time for a device like this to reach this price point.<br /><br />As for setup, I just don't understand anyone's complaints. It worked right out of the box. Just follow the instructions, make sure to sync it to the web based app and you will up and running in no time. If you have trouble, contact me through Amazon and I'll help out. I have no affiliation with DeLorme at all but I don't want this thing getting a bad rep because some end users don't understand the technology.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this."
"I have the household version of this and decided it was so good that I needed the car version as well. turns out my cigarette liter didn't have enough amps to run this at full potential so I added thicker wiring. With the right power supply it will charge 5 big tablets or various tablets, GPS, and phones at once in an hour  and adjusts each port to work to the charging needs of each device.. Well worth the investment if you work with multiple electronic devices in the field.. the actual USB cables this company makes are also awesome and have brought a few devices back from the dead that I thought the charging sockets were dead on."
Got my card in just a few days at  a great price.
THIS IS A GREAT BACKUP MONITOR FOR THE MONEY.  ONLY DRAWBACK IS MOUNTING THE MONITOR TO THE WINDOW {SUCTION CUP} OR ON THE DASH.  I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND THE HEAT GENERATED FROM THE SUN WILL DISTORT THE MONITOR SCREEN.  I'VE RESOLVED THIS PROBLEM BY EITHER PARKING IN THE SHADE OR USING REMOVABLE WINDOW SHADES.  FIRST TIME BACKING UP TO MY TRAILER USING THE BACKUP CAMERA WAS &#34;DEAD ON&#34;.  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE SUCCESS!!!!
Great system. Plays clear and loud. My system came with a 5 amp Inline fuse and adjustable handlebar clamps. When I called Boss to inquire about this they said that their older models didn't have the Inline fuse or handlebar  clamps. They added it to the newer MC500 systems about 9 months ago.
"My product expectations are satisfied. [[ASIN:B00V92MP6A Galaxy Centura Case, CellJoy® [Future Armor] Samsung Galaxy Centura S738C Discover S730G (WILL NOT FIT ANY OTHER MODEL) Case Hybrid Ultra Fit Dual Protection Holster **Kickstand** [Belt Clip Holster Combo] - Rugged Case for Galaxy Centura + Micro USB Rapid Car Charger by Celljoy (Wolf Gray)]]"
Didn't come with all necessary tools (according to the guy who fixed it) so there's not a tight seal around edges
Works splendid! For some reason it doesnt work in my vehicle for the Ipad Mini though? Works efficiently with the iPhone 5.
"Perfect fit, not bulky at all! Until I get a charging case, this case will stay on my phone! For a simple case this is pefect. On the downside, because  it's thin it doesn't seem like it offers much protection  if I drop my phone. However, it does cover all four corners which is a plus!"
"I'm never going back to plastic screen protectors again! All I did was clean my screen and make sure to keep the protector right side up after peeling off the adhesive side. Lined it up on the screen and dropped it on the phone. It began adhering itself instantly and I worked out the only bubble I had in seconds. It feels every bit as good as the bare glass screen and the tactile response is completely unhindered! Oh, and it is crystal clear! It does cover the front-facing camera, but that doesn't bother me at all (it would've driven me nuts trying to get the camera opening to line up anyways). Also, I have seen people complaining about the fit. I personally don't think I would want it any bigger because then it would be near impossible to get it properly lined up on the phone with much less room for error (mine wound up being a bit skewed to the top and left, but it's almost unnoticeable with my Cimo grip cover). Besides, it completely covers all VIEWABLE parts of the screen, what more could you want from a screen protector!?"
terrible if you know anything about audio. I have to turn it up way too loud to effectively hear the bass and treble effectively
What a great product. I love that the cables aren't 5 feet long. I use them everyday. You won't be disappointed
It's a nice phone case which is nice and very thin.  The only complaint is when you put the clip on the belt I had a hard time getting it off and needed some help.  Maybe it needs a little adjusting but otherwise this is a nice case.  Keep in mind this is a not a durable case so it's possible that if you drop the phone your glass could break.  Overall  VERY NICE case.
"Meets my need for my business phone - iPhone 5c, and wish I could find one for my 6+ and iPad mini just like it."
"My application for a pair of these 10 Amp Hour, 12 Volt Lithium batteries has been a perfect success!  Wired in series, they provide the 24-26 volts needed to power my electric bike.  I made a wiring connector that puts the batteries in parallel for charging with my 12-14 Volt auto battery charger, and series when connected to the bike.<br />The folks at Clean Republic were very helpful when I asked a question about chargers.  They sent my order right away, and it arrived well before I expected.  Their low price for a lithium ion battery of this capacity attracted my attention too.  Having replaced a pair of similar sized SLA batteries, I can tell you that the performance is awesome!  I love the dramatically lighter weight and much greater run time I get with these lithium batteries.  After two months of use I have no complaints or disappointments.  Great product, great vendor support, and a great price!"
"This case fits the iPad 2 perfectly.  It has a nice design and a soft feel to it.  I didn't give this case 5 stars, because the plastic case under the silicone is a little flimsily and in my opinion hard to put on.  It feels as if the plastic might crack while trying to secure it.  However once it is on it looks great.  I thought the stand was broken, but you have to pull the stand out and adjust the stand up or down in order to use it.  My husband really likes it.  He had the otter box and liked that one, but it was too bulky for him.  I believe this case will provide a little protect for your iPad.  We haven't dropped it so I am not sure about the protection factor with that, but it is better than not having one.  I would buy this product again.  One thing that puzzled me was the clear plastic that came with the case.  I believe it was supposed to be a screen protector but it was very hard and the plastic was a little dented.  It didn't make any sense to put it on so we opted not to and I believe it looks better without it."
"As bluetooth headphones, these work fine. DO NOT try to use them for any kind of activity where you won't be sitting completely still. The large control mechanism is heavy, awkward, and will unbalance the cord and/or pull the earpiece out, making for an uncomfortable and annoying situation.<br /><br />If the manufacturer had design skills and/or actually used prototypes of this before making them, they would realize they need to place the control mechanism in the middle where it would put even weight on both ears. Operating the controls is done sight-unseen anyways, and reaching around the back of your neck or under your chin is no more difficult than reaching by your ear. That would at least have given these a chance at working during activity.<br /><br />The return shipping kills the refund, so these will be given in place of a brick of coal to someone I don't like at Xmas."
Case was misspelled. &#34;Wen&#34; instead of &#34;when&#34;. Not pleased with product.
Much smaller than expected but works as described. Very satisfied with purchase.
"When the brash, fat and squat original Note made its debut, Samsung's competitors jeered, tittered and cackled. The consensus in the electronic realm was that it was too large, too unwieldy and entirely too cumbersome to be palatable as a phone. 5 years later, the Note has firmly established itself as a pacesetter. And the competitors are no longer laughing. Instead, they have fallen in line with the exemplary obeisance of a Roman soldier.<br /><br />With the Note 5, it is clear that Samsung has come a long way from yesteryears, when its phones were easily the most unappealing plastic hunks on the market. Its efforts to create more premium-looking devices is evident in this version. I've owned Notes 2, 3 and 4, and the Note 5 is the slimmest and most attractive yet of the line, with a glossy glass back and a redesigned stylus that pops out when depressed. Its design manages to make the unwieldy phablet more comfortable to hold in one hand than its predecessors. Packing an upgraded 16-megapixel camera which is capable of live YouTube streaming, it's hard not to be impressed by its social media credentials. The front facing camera is a selfie-lover's dream, having attained 5 megapixels; a notable increase from the prior model's 3.9 megapixels.  By far my  favorite new feature is the ability to jot notes on the phone screen while it remains turned off. And proximity charging is a cool, if not head-turning feature. Fast charging was introduced in the Note 4. This latest version charges even faster. The tiny speaker is now at the bottom of the phone, correcting last year's monumental mistake that found the Note 4's speaker on its back, muffling output.<br /><br />In operation: The Note 5 maintains the respectable 2,560 x1,440-pixel resolution of last year. It ships with Android 5.1 Lollipop; a nod and salute to Google's juvenile notion of naming an operating system after teeth-rotting appetizers. The oftentimes uneasy marriage between Google's Android and Samsung's Touchwiz appears less fractious than in prior iterations. More, the Note 5 will be eligible for an upgrade when Android 6.0 Marshmallow makes its debut. The operating system has been so efficiently implemented this time around as to improve battery life over and above the Note 4. With moderate use - a handful of emails, texts and one 30 minute call - it lasted about 16 hours. Which is impressive. This figure will vary for every Tom, Dick and Harry. Err, and Jane as well. Toggling on WIFI, Bluetooth and location services will deplete battery faster, as will a brighter screen. My recent switch from Sprint to T-Mobile may have also contributed to the battery's stellar performance. In my current location - Middle Kingdom, by the banks of the River of Delirium, U.S. of A. - Sprint's service is rather lacking, leading to a faster battery discharge. Any mobile phone will conserve battery best when its cellular service provider has abundant signals in any given geographical location. The converse is true: with a weak signal, the phone continues to search for a connection, depleting the battery faster. Since cellular providers are better in some locations and worse in others, a savvy consumer should research the issue before selecting one. Every major service provider in the U.S. sells the Note 5.<br /><br />But while some of the Note 4's more positive attributes such as an ultra power-saving mode carried over, Samsung eliminated some of the Note's most distinguishing features. These features were so key that I am returning this latest iteration, and renewing my relationship with my trusty old Note 4. One reason why I originally embraced the Note was because of its monstrous battery. I am a road warrior, and I needed an Amazonian who could match me step for step. To its credit, Samsung recognized early on that such a large phone would require a larger battery.The Note's battery capacity was increased with each successive release. Even in the electronic world, or perhaps particularly in the electronic world, size does matter. This time, not only has Samsung reduced the battery capacity from 3,220 mAh to 3,000 mAh, it has also towed Apple's line, and sealed the battery, such that it cannot be removed from the phone. No more swapping out batteries when travelling, or when it weakens from multiple charging cycles. The older Notes also came with an IR blaster, necessary for using the phone as a remote control. All of my electronic devices can be turned on with my Note 4. Handy for when the remote control plays hide and seek at the most inopportune times. The IR blaster has been eliminated in the Note 5.<br /><br />Gone also is the expandable slot. Users must now think carefully about how much media they plan on handling with the phone before purchasing. Storage can no longer be increased by the simple expedience of purchasing a micro SD card. Going from 32GB to 64GB will cost the average consumer about $100 more. A micro SD card is also handy for easy transfers. Accessing the same pictures, videos and music on a different phone is as easy as sliding out the card from the old phone and inserting it in the new one. Cautious users like myself prefer to keep digestible content on an SD card as opposed to the cloud. Just ask Ashley Madison. That ability is gone. The Note 5 is also more dainty. I didn't mind the faux leather back of the Notes 3 and 4, though it would have been nice to have real animal hide. After they die of natural causes, of course. Certainly. But the faux leather was tough to crack if the phone was dropped. And the leather resisted fingerprint smudges and lent Notes 4 and 5 a measure of sophistication reminiscent of Blackberry's original Bold. That has been eliminated as well. And all this for a narrower, slimmer profile and a glass back that may not survive Galileo's gravity test. A faustian bargain.<br /><br />In a nutshell: The Note 5 is an unworthy successor to last year's Note 4, and represents a step in the wrong direction. If you've never owned a Note, then this is a great phone, with lots of attributes that make sense for a phablet particularly as it relates to the stylus. If you are a previous Note owner, then gear up for disappointment with these new changes. I will hold out for 2016 which will surely bring us the Note 6. Eliminating choices for consumers and issuing a positive press release was ever an audacious move. Other than different operating systems, broadly speaking, the stylus is now the only real difference between the iPhone Plus and the Note. It will forever remain a head-scratcher to find companies attempting to eliminate competition by mimicking the products that they are competing with. Rather than distinguishing their own products even more. Go figure. It is my sincere hope that Samsung will reverse course in the 2016's Note, which is surely coming to a theatre near you, probably in September of next year.ize does matter. This time, not only has Samsung reduced the battery capacity from 3,220 mAh to 3,000 mAh, it has also towed Apple's line, and sealed the battery, such that it cannot be removed from the phone. No more swapping out batteries when travelling, or when it weakens from multiple charging cycles. The older Notes also came with an IR blaster, necessary for using the phone as a remote control.

If you are a previous Note owner, then gear up for disappointment with these new changes. I will hold out for 2016 which will surely bring us the Note 6. Eliminating choices for consumers and issuing a positive press release was ever an audacious move. Other than different operating systems, broadly speaking, the stylus is now the only real difference between the iPhone Plus and the Note. It will forever remain a head-scratcher to find companies attempting to eliminate competition by mimicking the products that they are competing with. Rather than distinguishing their own products even more. Go figure. It is my sincere hope that Samsung will reverse course in the 2016's Note, which is surely coming to a theatre near you, probably in September of next year."
a very fine case for the iphone 5/5s. very well made and easy to use. I like the 3 interchangeable backs
Decent product. Makes the phone easy to pick up and use because it only goes around the sides.
"Works just like the OEM, and feels more sturdy."
"Honestly, with this selfie stick you can experience sooo much fun that you can't even imagine.<br />I like this thing, and also with the 90 day money back guarantee it's perfect."
"Stopped working after 6 weeks, which is 2 weeks after &#34;warranty&#34; expires.  Waste of money."
"Waste of money and time! These are so flimsy. they start  to come back off as you remove the second layer of film on the front of them (which is thicker and heavier than the product itself - hello, it's physics that a heavier sheet being pulled from a lighter one will put more force than otherwise). Then, when you try to get the new bubbles that appear after pulling that sheet away, the slightest touch by the provided card or credit card to smooth bubbles permanently scratches the flimsy useless screen cover you just installed. I wasted both of the provided sheets of screen cover. I would like my money back! What a waste!"
Great Android Tracfone.  WAY better than the ZTE I had before!
"I know it's a bit scary to be faced with changing your broken LCD by yourself, but in my case everything went terrifically well! The LCD came way before expected-they shipped it on the day I ordered and it came in 1 week probably. It was very nicely packaged and arrived unharmed in excellent condition! They have a booklet with instructions with it, but instead I went for a youtube video showing how to do it. There was also a tool pack that I did not use. I heated the broken LCD with a hair dryer on the edges and then removed it carefully with a sharp nail file. As you use the sharp tool-the nail file, or their tools or whatever you find, you will need to keep the LCD detached, because you can only detach a small area at once and then it may glue itself back. For that, I used toothpicks. Once you removed the LCD, you will see the inside of the phone and there will be a place where the LCD is attached. Just, pull this off and place your new LCD. This lCD came with a home button, so I just removed mine. This seemed easier to do as  you just need to pull it up, but if you needed to insert the new one, it a bit tricky to figure out how far it goes and where exactly as it is on the inside of the phone somewhere. Then, comes the tape. You have to get the thin tape for cell phones and align the rims on the inside of the LCD with it so that when you press firmly it tapes itself to the phone. Otherwise, it would fall apart. Once this is done, you are ready to go!!! Job is finished! The LCD worked perfectly well for me-you can't even tell I have changed it-oh it also says &#34;Samsung&#34; on top. It really looks like the original one! Goodluck to all the do it yourself ppl out there venturing to that and save some money! Especially, the girls! I'll be happy to answer some questions, if needed!"
"Saved me well over $400+ as I staved off buying a phone and waiting for my mobile contract renewal. The cable connector in my Galaxy S4 no longer made a connection that would charge the phone. I had the ritual of removing the battery and charging it this cradle at night. Each day, for about two months, I'd insert the newly charged battery in my phone. I have since upgraded to the Galaxy S6. I strongly recommend the RAVPower charging cradle."
Thank you so much!<br />This phone is great...
"they're the GREATEST screen covers, they do what they say they do!"
"Great case for the price, i had the lifeproof case for 1 year with my previous phone  and this time with my new samsung galaxy 6 i didnt wantez go spend 70 dlls on a case so i gound this one with the protective screen integrated and its perfect beautiful and sturdy, thank you"
It's really nice but neefs more slot so i can use more as an wallet and never miss place my phone or wallet and the case makes it hard to be heard plus bottons are hard to push but other than it is  great.
"I would give it 5 stars, however the card slots are extremely tight. Otherwise it's a great case."
"Bought this to power my Polk audio interior speakers, I've had this amp for a few months and its a HUGE improvement over running them off my head unit! I love the sound quality and volume! Plus this amp looks amazing and doesn't get hot! I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a good quality amp that's not too pricey!"
"This is one of the few screen protectors that I've tried (and believe me, I've gone thru quite a few) that is both easy and effortless to apply and excellent once applied.<br />Got the installation done first time with real ease and no bubbles or other mishaps. Sits on the phone perfectly and the feel when using the phone is perfect - just the right amount of resistance without being to slippery or to coarse.<br />Much less fingerprint smudge than without screen protector.<br />In short, a screen protector well worth the cost (which is minimal, anyway...)"
"I can't begin to tell you how many times I have bought earphones and have been disappointed. But this brand has really come through, I love the fact that it has lasted a long time, most other brands have really a short duration before one side no longer works, or both. They are comfortable the sound is quite good, not really excellent but for the price, I am pretty happy with it."
This Bluetooth transmitter works well and as intended. I would prefer the battery lasted longer but at least you can charge and use at the same time. Reception is pretty good writing 15 ft and plugged in behind TV.
"Not very good , poor instructions, a toy at best"
"great screen protecter, very good size, nice transperansy, strong and thik enough to protect the screen, I strongly recommend it."
Great case. Love the belt clip. Have dropped phone  Couple times already and it takes it with pride. Seems sturdy. However I have issues with the kickstand at times . It's not the easiest to pop out. Not sure if it's gotten looser or I've just gotten better at it with time. I did &#34;break&#34; it by accident twice but only the little part on the bottom popped out and I was able to carefully snap it back in but I still wish it were easier to pop in and out. But other than that awesome case and belt clip casing.
"Too strong of spring with case for S5 Phone keep pulling holder out of vent, also blocked too much air out of vent.<br />It is now in a dumpster, Tossed it out the car window by a open dumpster"
"This is a great little phone, but major flaws come with such a cheap price tag. First, there is an &#34;&&#34; key, rather than a dedicated &#34;.&#34; Button. Epic fail on the part of Plum. The system runs fine, but you will have to root the phone if you want more than 100mb of phone space, as certain apps will not install to an SD card. Other than that it functions well and is definitely a good back up phone for its price."
Straight talk is saying that this phone I purchased from you is not a straight talk phone and wants me to shell out for an activation card for it instead of transferring it over. My previous straight talk phone (from Walmart) also said Verizon I the box. The problem here isn't with the phone per se; the problem is with straight talk.<br /><br />Nice phone. Arrived quicker than expected.
"This thing sucks. If I set my phone down, my phone shuts off. I guess it's because it doesn't fit into my phone as snug as the original. When it was in my phone it didn't hold a charge anyway. Don't waste your money."
Case was perfect ! My daughter loved it
"This is my first smart phone .. I had a short learning curve .. but overall, it's easy to set up and use .. and has many more features and capabilities that I ever expected !  LOVE IT !"
I could not find the one I liked on my stolen Garmin.  This was a good second choice.  It is quite sturdy and protects the Garmin from outside elements.
"Works perfect. Fast, effective charging with no delay or &#34;do you trust this cable&#34; messages. Charged my phone 30% in 30 minutes."
"If it could be zero stars, it would be. Got the battery today, put it into my LG G2 VS980, phone worked fine for a couple of hours. Battery caused my phone to overheat and the battery seized up. Had to put the original battery into the phone in order for it to turn back on again. I would like my money back for this shoddy product."
"This is one of the nicest cases I've ever seen and used. The fit and finish are spot-on. The plastic bumper ring that surrounds the phone fit very snug and doesn't come off easily which could be an issue of you're a battery swapper, we're not so its okay. The case fits so good you really can't tell there's anything on the phone like some of the more bulky cases yet I believe there's enough protection for just about any reasonable drop. I've seen questions about if this case works with the leather battery cover and as you can see in the photos it fits fine. All the cutouts are lined up perfectly and don't get in the way of using them. The case took about 5 days to ship this color combination since it wasn't a Prime item but it was well worth the wait."
Case looks great and it is very soft and durable.  It doesn't fit as tightly as I thought it would but it is still a good case.
"I've had this case for little over 7 months. The case broke on the side tab and I still used it. Then it started to break more tabs on the same side. Just dropped my phone today and it cracked my screen. Even with the 2 screen protectors, that didn't come with. Now I have to buy a new phone and case. Will not purchase this case at all. So don't waist your time with it."
"Easy to apply, but the adhesive isn't really sticky. The bottom right corner of my screen protector has peeled up (I have no case on my s6-Edge) and has been making it difficult for me to use the whole right side of my phone. Also, I don't know how everybody elses phones have been functioning after this, but using Swiftkey has also proven to be difficult - because of the thick layer of temper glass, the keyboard loses the tracing ability and often loses track of my finger when I'm typing, so I often get words that I don't want to say."
"Really pleased with this case!  Very solid but yet feels soft and nice to hold.  The outside is a hard shell with cushioned corners and the inside has cushioning as well.  It appears that it will keep my phone from breaking or cracking if dropped which is all I care about.  It also came with a screen protector but since I already have one, I haven't used it yet.  Great pink color too.  Not too bright or shiny.  Great case!"
Not the same color as shown.  Scratches horribly
"This is a fantastic case in both appearance, feel and usage.<br />Buttons are still easy to use, screen touch is still sensitive.<br />This isn't crazy bulky like some other cases, or odd looking like the waterproof pouch my son bought.<br />I'm not about to throw my iPhone in the pool just yet but it's nice to know I have protection.<br />I bought this at a discount but came back for 2 more for my daughters and see it is unavailable, another listing has it but only in blue."
Not my favorite cover.  Wish that it had a screen protector.
"I've purchased a couple of MPOWs over the past couple of years and really liked the combination of price, quality and features.  It is a perfect style of device for audio books and podcasts when you don't want to use full headphones or have that silly microphone boom sticking out.  (I rarely make calls with this device - the microphone is not great, but I would prefer a device without a microphone at all.)<br /><br />At this price, I didn't expect these things to last forever. But this newer model failed after just 3 months.  I can no longer get it to charge.  At about 2 months, I had to start wiggling the connector to get it to engage.  Now it won't charge at all and it's apparently to late to return for a replacement.  Disappointing.  I've been trying the Dylan with better success ... thus far anyway."
Grips on my note 4 perfectly. Positioning is a breeze.  The niybt just falls from windshield when left in heat.
"There is difficulty  in changing the stations. In addition, the movie quality needs improvement."
"Great for travel, Keeps the droid charged for extra pics."
Great phone . Easy to use .
This case is everything especially if you stay dropping your phone like me.
"Okay, I didn't know how awesome these chargers are when I bought them. First of all, they come with little caps over both the USB part and the charger part, which isn't a super big deal, but they're kind of nice to keep dust out. Secondly, the cord is flat, which again isn't really a big deal, but it's kind of neat. The COOLEST thing about these is that they are ALSO a micro-usb cord, you simply pull underneath the charger part and the micro USB is revealed. Like I said, I didn't know this when I bought them, I just bought the cords that were the most bang for my buck. It took a while for them to get to me, but it was definitely worth the wait. Would buy again, but I should have enough to last me a while :~)"
"Can it charge a phone or tablet? Probably, it's designed for that after all.<br /><br />For an alternative use this unit is perfect for a low-cost but extremely efficient Raspberry Pi (or similar) UPS. Just plug it between your Pi and its power supply and you have an UPS ready to go. This unit is perfectly able to charge while still providing power to plugged devices and as long you supply more power than you use, you are all set.<br />Perfect to prevent SD card corruption in case of power outage, to keep your IOT brain alive in any circumstances, or just to bring your Pi with you on an adventure!<br /><br />Currently power 2 Pi (osmc + domoticz) and 1 arduino Mega running RFLink (include RTC and 433MHz Tx/Rx modules) without any stability problems."
Not very practical phone docker can't be used if a case on the phone.  No one once to take off the case all night
I have used this head set for years and it is the best of the best!
Great item to get to protect your Iphone Plus screen.  So easy to use.  I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review
"NOT FOR NEXUS 6-- it says it is, and in fact it's one of the only ones that's conveniently searchable by that model on Amazon, but mine broke 7 minutes after putting the phone in the stand. The little plastic tabs that act as stoppers at max extension (the phone was in portrait mode as shown in the main product image) snapped because they were clearly overtaxed by such a big phone. If you want one for your Nexus 6, I got great joy from another Amazon-carried product of just $2 more. To find it, I just googled &#34;best car holder for Nexus 6&#34; rather than relying on Amazon's search engine."
"Nice look, ok fit, alothough it is slippery and I constantly feel like there's oil or grease on it. And I don't like the open upper corner."
"Have used two of them, follow the instructions and both were fairly easy to switch out with the old broken cases. Operates clean with no hard push."
well worth for the price.  Keeps its charge really well works great with I phone.  Best feature is its vibrating system that alerts you on incoming calls.  Few times it drops the songs if you are moving.  Sounds are very clear and mic is strong.
"Great case. As always only main complaint is that no matter how I put it on their always seems to be that annoying bubble oil look on onew edge of the front screen. Not an issue but annoying to look at. As someone else stated s pen is a little annoying to get out,but for 20 bucks, I'd rather have this than an otterbox. But if lifep roof ever come out with a case I'd see myself switching. Mainly due to it being completely sealed and waterproof. Other than that this is the only case I buy."
"This wallet has 3 card slots, one of which is a clear mesh for driver's license and a bill slot.  It is very well made of PU leather.  All the openings are precise for the Galaxy Note 4.  Overall it is a great wallet."
"Bought it for my galaxy 3, and when I plugged it in to charge, it wouldn't work. Found it worked in my tablet, but after a week it quit working. This is junk, don't waste your time or money!"
"This cell phone case is adorable. I like the bling. The flowers and rhinestones are so cute. I've received many compliments in the two days that I've been using it so far. I've seen lots of cases with embellishments on the back, but most are just way too much for my taste. This one is just right. It's cute without being gaudy. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it doesn't really do much to protect the phone and is more decorative than functional and it's somewhat slippery to hold. That being said, if you have a tempered glass screen protector, your phone should still be adequately protected. All in all, it's very cute and a good bargain. I received this phone case in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This does not affect my opinion in any way."
Great case for i phone 6; slim and light. Comes with a tempered glass screen protector which is very easy to install; just make sure you leave the phone in the Sahara case while installing the protector
"Working great so far after a couple weeks. Doesn't seem to get hot even with 5 ports in use. Perfect for home base, and simplifies travel as you  don't have to bring 5 separate chargers with you anymore, and you only need a single outlet, which is sometimes all you can find. Seems like good quality so I'm thinking/hoping it will last."
"Worked great until phone fell off bedside and bent the plug part that connects to phone. It's made very well,in my opinion."
"Good, thin case.  It won't help is survive a brutal drop but it does have decent grip and has a ridge to keep the glass off the table or ground."
I just hate the case
Thanks for the feedback. Very useful !!
"Amazingly good product.  Charges about double the speed of our old chargers and far faster than the wall charger.  I highly recommend it, also it's dimensions are nicer than the many products because it easily fits in a pocket without sticking out. If you need a rock solid, fast charging, 10kmah charger-- this is the one.  Can't recommend it enough."
"These days, with so many devices capable of being powered or charged by USB connections... and with a limited number of USB charging ports on our laptops and USB hubs... what do you do?<br /><br />One good choice is to get this four port charger from Letouch! It plugs directly into the wall and is rated at 24w x 4.8A, with its flow optimized by smart chip technology. There is no detail in the specifications on the max output of any given port, so let's assume it is around 2A. Since the max flow of this unit is 4.8A, if you have a high drain device connected to the charger that would leave 2.8A to be shared by the other three ports. If you decided to put all four ports to use at one time, connecting devices requiring at least 1A, the average distribution would be about 1.2A... still better than your typical 1A wall charger.<br /><br />Confirming this, the charge rates for the devices we plugged into it (iPhone 5c, HTC Droid DNA, and Samsung Galaxy S3) all met or exceeded what we typically get from the OEM chargers that came with those devices, and our typical charge rate was about 1/2% per minute (1% every two minutes, or about 30% per hour).<br /><br />At 3 inches long, 2 inches wide, about 1.2 inches thick and weighing in at 4 ounces per our postal scale, this unit is small enough to pack and take on any trip, and it seems solid and well constructed. when packing it up, don't forget to pack the four foot long power cord too.<br /><br />If you are looking for a plug-in style, four port USB charger that you could take with you on trips, a charger with this rate of flow, style, size and price, for use as I have described above, then we would recommend giving this Letouch 24W 5V 4.8A Wall Charger a try based on our experience with it.<br /><br />The only opportunity we see if for a power boost with the next iteration; 36W (7.2A) or 48W (9.6A) max flow would make this a five star consideration.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience.jectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
I owned this product once before when o first bought my iPhone 4s but due to my own careless attitude it broke so I had to buy it again.<br />It is a great product and is easy to install. It comes with a screen protector which is also easy to install.<br />I highly recommend buying this product if you are in need of a great phone cover.
This item come on time and it works great. I was going to spend 100.00 at verizon for the same item.
I'm waiting for someone to get back with me so I can return it. It's not what I expected it to be. I wanted gold and it was copper.
Charging cord breaks easily and can not be purchased separately.
what a great protective case  luv it
Great product doesn't move or slide
"For the price I am really happy with the overall sound quality and volume. At higher volumes the bass makes it shake a lot. Battery has lasted me between 7-9 hours on avg the last couple weeks (it may depend on the volume). As far as I can tell it randomizes songs on USB from when they were added to the device, which is a tad odd but nothing to knock it for. Cannot comment on bluetooth functionality as I haven't used it."
The case fts my iPhone 6p perfectly. I wish the pic on the back was a bit brighter though. The case has a non slip feel to it when holding it in your hand which is really good. I would purchase another if I wanted to.
This fit the phone perfectly.  It was easy to install and I have had not problem using the touch screen.
"After dissatisfaction with other screen protectors, I was a bit cynical that this product would perform as promised, but it exceeded all expectations. It was very easy to align and applied with no trapped bubbles. There's no plastic feel that I've experienced with other protectors. I plan to purchase more."
"The shipping was quick, the screen protector was easy to apply had no issues with bubbles."
It was a gift. Fits phone pretty well and looks good.
"take some work to figure it out...  for someone who isn't a techie...  note that you have to manually stop it when you stop and then restart when you start again...  and that you need to pay attention to the &#34;yes&#34;...  which means that to start you need to push start, then push start again, and then push enter...  which wasn't exactly intuitive to me...  I'm beginning to get the hang of it though..."
Looks really nice. Works well. It does what it says it does. Need to note that I got this product for free.
I love this case. It gives the protection I need without all of the bulk. Unfortunately I dropped my phone and the screen still cracked from a face down impact. The guy that changed my screen said there isn't a case out there that he knows of that could protect the screen from that impact. Of course he may want me to break it again and pay him to replace it.<br /><br />It looks good and feels good. Can be a little slippery with one hand operation. But it is a 6+...one hand operation isn't that easy anyways.
Wasnt a fan of leather case being really easy to loosen up
"Fits my phone perfect! Cheap and super fast shipping. I would order this again if I ever need another. Only down side is that it's difficult to remove once put on, but this has already saved my phone from damage."
"My first experience with solar.  Easy to operate and juice up phone, etc. for camping, biking, boating and such.  Small size makes it a cinch to carry anywhere.  The flashlight is super handy and BRIGHT!  Bought it at the same time as X-DRAGON High Efficiency 20W Solar Panel Charger with iSolar Technology.  Same review for that, too."
Ok products. Kinda hard to put on though. Went back to the flip cover I bought at the store when I purchased the Samsung  5S .
Super cute and sleek! Makes my phone feel very protected!! Would definitely repurchase!
"I was very excited to receive this cute phone case. I put it on and it fits well. It is tight on the phone. My complaint and why I didn't give this 5 stars is because the button cutouts make it hard to press your phone buttons on the sides. You have to press really hard and dig in there. I don't know if I will be using this case for very long because of that reason. It is also a bit flimsy, cheaply made. I just don't feel like my phone is well protected and I don't like how hard it is to press the buttons.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews."
Keeps smudges and scratches off my screen. Great buy!
Not bad at all but slightly disappointed by how the edges around your screen look. The bow/crystal thing fell off but reattached easily with super glue. Not quite as plus as it looks in the picture
this is a gret charger to use when im not at home it charges my phone up to 100% thanks
If you've had issues with plugging-in either the phone charger or headphones I'd suggest pushing the case down slightly and then plugging them in... That's the reason why I rated this 4 stars...
"The selfie stick worked great the first day, but after that, it wouldn't work with my iPhone 6. The stick worked great with my friends iPhone 4 and 5, but the iPhone 6 isn't working."
What a great little phone case for a great price. Protects phone well and looks good.
"Is a very tight fit for my iPhone 6 Plus in a case but it does work, mostly."
"Anker is my family's favorite brand. We have a large family owning mini ipads, maxi ipads, iphone 5's and 6.  The end that plugs in the &#34;i whatevers&#34; tend to be the weak link of any lightning cable.  So far of the many brands sold on Amazon, Anker seems to hold up the best.  I actually spend at least $125.00 a year on lightning charger cables and need to file warranty claim with Anker for at least 4 cables that have gone bad. We'll see how that works out and how difficult it ends up being. It's the charging while using the device that kills the cables the best I can tell."
"Item description says &#34;Bundle of 10 Colors&#34;, &#34;Flat&#34;, including &#34;colors:Black ,White ,Pink ,Hot Pink ,Purple ,Green ,Yellow, Blue, Red ,Orange&#34; Received: *1 (one)*, *purple*, *round* braided cable.<br />Deceptive Description<br />Items ships from &#34;Nimbus Smoke Shop&#34; in Denver, CO<br />[[ASIN:B00ZAR7LAA Nimbus Bundle of 10 Colors 1m Durable Braided Nylon Flat Noodle USB 2.0 Data Sync Cable Charging for Ip 5 5s 6 6 Plus]]"
Works well.  My only knock on it is the loud beep it makes when it's pairing.
"The battery doesn't last @ all,  only an hour if u listen to music & the ear phones are very muffled where you never understand what the caller is saying..  they were a package of 3 yet all came weeks apart. The only good thing is the price & the colors"
The Dash cam was very easy to assemble although the mount wasn't stable at all and it didn't mount well so we had to mickey mouse the dash cam to fit properly. The Dash cam records well. It's clear and it records but it has a muffled sound. We ended up taking this off and buying another brand.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
One of the first to come out and I'm very pleased. Will purchase different colors in the near future.
This case started to chip and crack within the first week. Even though I had not dropped my phone. It also was extremely difficult to get off once I decided to get rid of it.
"My case fits my phone perfect, I love the color it looks exactly how it does on Amazon website and it's heavy duty just what I was looking for. Shipping was super fast I ordered Friday and I received Sunday morning. Highly recommend this product."
"I like the case but the clip had to be replaced after just 3 weeks ! The company sent me the new clips, but it shouldn't have broken so easily,"
I was not able to fix my phone with this product and the instructions were not good at all. I have an IPhone 6 plus and not I can not hear without the phone being on speaker or ear plugs. I have to take it to professionals to have the glass installed and fixed now the lost of privacy hearing.

"We have a several weather-proof power bank batteries, and this is one that really seems to be done right. It is ruggedly stylish but has a functional design, with a rubberized covering that is easy to grip (even when damp) and rubber closures for the input and output ports.<br /><br />This power bank's 5000mAh capacity provides the juice needed for most situations, while its size (5 inches long x 3 inches wide and just 1/2 inch thick, weighing only 5 ounces) is perfect for stowing in your pack. I like this battery very much.<br /><br />Given its capacity, solar recharging capability, and its water-resistant design, this power bank is priced at the top end as compared similar devices, seems to be very well constructed, and is ready to hit the trail with you.<br /><br />The solar powered recharging capability is outstanding, though the manufacturer recommends that you reserve the use of solar recharging only for those times when you really need it and that you do not let the battery completely drain and try to recharge it with solar power.<br /><br />We successfully tested the battery using multiple devices, as summarized below.<br /><br />Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our Samsung S3's wall adapter and two of its four blue LED lights came on indicating that charging was taking place and that it arrived about 50% pre-charged. About two hours later, the unit was fully charged by our 2A wall charger and we put it to immediate use.<br /><br />Operating this battery is simple -- open either rubber cover (one on each side) and just use your cable to connect the battery to your device, and let it work. This battery does come with one short micro-USB cable, so you have to use your own lightning cable if trying to charge an Apple device. We used our own cables and the device produced almost 1% per minute from the 2A port... about half that much from the 1A port.<br /><br />At 5000mAh, this battery is good for a quick boost, a couple charges of our smaller devices, and a full charge for our larger smartphones. It is just the right size to have around for emergencies, on day trips and even as part of our back-up gear when fishing (give the water-resistant covering), hiking and camping.<br /><br />Solar charging capability, affordable, rugged, water-resistant, portable, and did the job as described by the manufacturer. If you are looking for a battery pack of this size, functionality, rugged look and feel, and good capacity, for use as I have described above, then I highly recommend giving this power bank a try based on our experience with it.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

So cute! It is a snap on plastic case so it doesn't offer a lot of protection - but it does have a good bumper around the edge of the case that will help with some bumps and small drops. The printing is better than I expected. The words are clear and easy to read.
Works perfectly. Great picture.
great.  saved my screen from many drops and spills.  Unfortunately my dog found he could chew through it with no problem
The Galaxy core prime  case is a very good item and everything I was looking for to protect  my new investment.
"Nice snug fit, even with a thicker screen protector. The only downsides- Headphone port is a little offset so jack needs special attention to connect; Bottom of case is thick, making charging port access more difficult; Buttons require quite a bit of force to detect being pushed. Other than those minor things, it's a great case with a soft/flexible inner and hard exterior."
really amazing smartwatch. I switched to android because of this watch and I did the right thing. Looks so much better than iWatch.
The case comes with a holster belt clip which was definitely a plus but the actual phone case feels too slippery in the hands. I must say that the case build is sturdy and that's the best part about it. I I'll continue to test it out to see if my opinion changes.<br /><br />I was given a discount on this product in order to review the product.
Delivered fast. Good quality.
Just got mine. Slim and looks very much Part of the phone. Very happy with this case
4 of them didn't even work or plug into the phone. The rest seem fine.
"The clear case fits very well on my iPhone 6. It has a very smooth finish to it and it’s not so big in size where it’s bulky and adds extra weight. I like how it is clear and can match with everything you’re wearing. When it comes to easy access, this case does the job. I can easily take it out of my pocket versus others where I have a hard time taking it out. The scratch free design is pretty impressive and highly recommended especially it being resistant bumper case. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
"So i researched a lot about this phoned before I purchased it and I'm sure that most people interested in this phone who are not from China, Taiwan, India, or any other country where it is sold in store, you may have done your research too.  Most of what I read about the phone is true<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Lightweight<br />-Unique Color (if you get the bright yellow, I hate yellow but this phone is cute)<br />-Large Phone, but not too wide (if you like watching videos or playing games, this is a good thing and it easier to hold)<br />-Good camera quality for the price (frontal, and rear camera)<br />-Great screen resolution<br />-Good speed<br />-TONS of space for the average user (but there is a con associated with this)<br />-Decent amount of ram (most cheap smart phones on have 1gb ram. This has 2)<br />-Cute ringtone (i just really enjoyed that)<br />-LED lights for notifications (very convenient IMO)<br />-Has its own CWM recovery mode<br /><br />CONS:<br />-NO OPTION TO MOVE SPACE TO SD CARD (in some devices, I swill further elaborate)<br />-Too much bloatware (pre-installed apps)<br />-does lag once in while but it goes back to normal immediately (gets better if you fix bloatware issue)<br />-app for storing contacts sucks (just download a new app)<br />-No app drawer (not a problem if you are used to phones without one though)<br />-No download manager (you can download that too)<br />-Not 4g LTE capable AT ALL. (this phone is not capable of running on 4g LTE networks in the U.S. Although it may say you are running on normal 4g networks, it's not actually 4g. It's an upgraded form of 3g. Still fast though)<br /><br />So im not sure why some phone has this issue and some don't, but my device was one that had absolutely no option for me to force apps onto my sd card. Even when i changed the setting to pre-install my apps onto my external storage, it would still be stored onto my internal storage. Its so frustration to not be able to utilize all the space thatthis phone comes with (i purchased the one with a 32gb sd card). I was not able to find any other way to fix this issue without having to root my phone. I'm SOOOO not a technical geek, so i had to do a fair share of research to learn how to do this correctly (i was really afraid of bricking my phone). So if you happen to get the phone with the same issue that had, your only options are to deal with a limited amount of space, wait until lenovo releases the update to fix this bug, or root your phone. To root your phone, I would follow the steps i found on the youtube channel, RootJunkies"
I love this case!  It fits well with a large cutout for the camera lens unlike some other cases. The price is another benefit!  I would highly recommend this!
"This item is not as good as the previous versions<br />The worst problem is that the devices switches off suddenly as if the battery is low, even if it is not<br />On freeways you must constantly drive much above the speed limits to maintain the expected time of arrival (which is totally unacceptable!)<br />The display is cluttered by the graphic information on the bottom<br />The iQ feature is not as accurate as in previous versions"
"Worked great, but eventually cracked.  The first one I had for several months and it worked great.  The second also lasted for a few months, but the 3rd and current one cracked after a little over 1 week..  Edit. Their customer support contacted me and suggested that I submit a warranty claim, which I did.  Their customer rep was very helpful and Tech Armor shipped me a replacement screen protector within a week."
Haven't used them because phone came with a screen protector already on it.<br />price was not bad and its good to have them when i need them
It's okay but not exactly what I was hoping for; I use it until I find something I like better;
I was very excited to this and had high hopes. It did everything it says it does and I was very happy with it. I owned this adapter about 6 months rarely using it up until I injured myself recently and have been bedridden my internet is not yet hooked up at my new place so I thought this would be a life saver! And it was for the first 4 days. It then just stopped working for no apparent reason I've tested my hdmi cords and swapped them and the adapter just simply crapped out on me.  I hope this is just a rare occurrence it's a great idea and worked perfect up until yesterday I am very disappointed. :(
I had wasted money on a clip that broke the second day. This made me very happy and works great.
Perfect!! It hold 4 cards securely and its perfect!!
"Did not work at all, vendor willing to exchange, but not paying for return ($10). Very disappointing!!!"
"Best lightning cable out there!  The cord is sturdy and holds up well while traveling.  I purchased 3 cables within the last 6 months.  All 3 cables are still working great.  Even with one cable used as the traveling cable, it has withstood constant rolling and moving when packed and unpacked.  Absolutely no signs of wear.  It seems like it even charges faster than the Apple supplied cords.  Highly recommend!"
Product just as advertised. Great merchant
This is a great value!  I really like the look of this band.  It's a great everyday look. The shipping was quick
"They work!!!  i tried all 4 ports in my car with my cell phone, they all work just fine"
There is a whining noise and I will be listening to music and all of a sudden it will disconnect and stop going through my speakers!
"This is a Great product!  I don't have an iPhone I have an android with a smart watch.  But it still fit perfectly.  I have it sitting on my desk next to my computer.  The most impressive thing was the quality of the product.  It is like a brushed metal. Not plastic or cheap material.  For the price and the function, this is DEFINITELY a 5 star product.  I was fortunate enough to receive this during a promotion.  In no way was my opinion influenced by the promotion and this review is my own."
"Charges my phone really fast, if I am using the correct cable. As far as the battery reader part I honestly don't pay that much attention to it to say if it accurate or not.."
I purchased this phone as an upgrade to a Nokia 520 i was using and in my opinion it wasn't much of an upgrade in fact it has been a downgrade.Although this phone has features and specs that the 520 does not have in my opinion the 520 is the better phone.I have had a few issues with this phone..The Battery drains quick (without having the display at the brightest setting) it has also shutdown on me for no apparent reason.it has dialed numbers on its own and while searching for something on the net it has closed the browser on its own several times ..In ending this review i will say that if anyone is on the fence about whether to purchase the Nokia 520 or the 635 in my opinion you should go with the 520.
"Fits well, and easy to holster and extract.  Lasted several months now."
Love the sounds. I have this working with a MW-1075 10&#34; woofer and either (2) 8&#34; or 1 10&#34; passive for the H8 1.8&#34;. I will up date with my finished set up.
"This is an awesome power pack. I tested it a lot, and it's very close to the full 14000 mAh. A lot of power packs are only 1/2 or 1/3rd of what they're rated at, but this one is very close to 14000 mAh. It charges my phone about seven full times when my phone is about 1/3rd full, which is awesome.<br /><br />It has a 2A input, which means that it charges extremely fast, and will fully charge from empty in about 6 hours. Most battery packs only have 1A inputs, and this size usually takes over 24 hours to charge, but this one is super fast to charge. Also, both of the outputs are 2A outputs, so you don't have to keep fumbling around in the dark for the fast port, because they're both fast. But, if you charge two devices at the same time, then it throttles the total to 3.5A. I usually don't charge two devices at the same time on any battery pack, unless its an emergency, because it seems like all battery packs discharge exponentially faster if there are two devices connected. It doesn't start charging other devices as soon as you plug a device in. You have to plug in a device, and then press the button for it to start charging. Also, the four lights don't exactly correspond to how full it is. At 2 lights, it's almost empty, when I would expect to still have 3 phone charges left.<br /><br />I like the design a lot. It's long and sleek, and it's very thin. It's a nice black color, so it will fit in a backpack or a purse nicely, and looks stylish, too. Overall, this is great, and I highly recommend it!<br /><br />*Swees gave me this battery to review*"
"By god, i thought i was ordering a pencil sharpener but, it was even better than i expected. It only charged my pens and pencils, its also been great to my wife and children...we love plugging our electronics into this, its got some many outlets, its made our one room desolate apartment life so much better."
"the rubber and plastic case fits the phone well and the belt clip holds  phone firmly, I use ii 4 days a week and work outside walking in all different terrains and belt clip has  never lost the phone. It arrived  in 3 days from time of order. Its now 1 month old and still holding up well. So far its worth the inexpensive price I paid for it compared to higher priced models that look exactly alike,"
Clip wasn't the one shown in photos. Not otterbox brand. Cheap plastic. Was broken within a week. Not worth the money.
"Debated between this product and Fitbit. I love this item!!! I'm able to check steps, distance, calories burnt, and time at the touch of a button. Highly recommend it. I bought a light blue band to go with the navy one it came with."
"Once i got this, it seems like everything uses a micro usb. I should have bought 2 packs! I might do just that..."
Charges battery slowly so you have to plug it in the night before but works great & it is nice to have a spare battery for my LG G4 which eats batteries up like I eat cookies.
"Charges your phone up pretty fast.  Fun while it lasted, but then died after just 3 months.  I will be contacting Samsung for a refund or replacement."
Great case great price with no need to buy a screen protector....at least for me.
"Let me start by saying that this phone is phenomenal. Price to value ratio is excellent. Beautiful screen, snappy performance with excellent audio quality. Very very impressive. We need more phones like these in the US market to compete with the big boys as I am tired of paying $900+ for a phone. Honestly this phone should be the flagship killer instead of Oneplus 2.<br /><br />Screen<br />5.5” Gorilla Glass 3 screen with a resolution of 2560x1440<br />It is extremely bright with Vivid colors. This screen is pleasure to look at.<br />Another thing about this beautiful display is that there is some type of coating that prevents finger prints and I love it. Every phone in the market should be like Axon!!<br /><br />Performance<br />What can I say; 4gb ram paired up with Snapdragon 810. Everything is fluid, multi tasking is a breeze. The only thing I realized is that Geekbench was showing the CPU speed as 1.56ghz instead of the advertised 2.0ghz. I am not sure if this is a fluke or Geekbench needs to be updated to support the latest CPUs.<br /><br />Audio<br />Well, well, well what do we here. Hi-Fi sound was one of the main features that really made me try this phone and I am glad I did. I have a pair of Shure 535s and they sound beautiful with this phone. Loud, very crisp and extremely detailed when compared to other phones such as Galaxy S6, Nexus 6 and Oneplus 2. Bravo ZTE! You guys knocked it out of the park!<br />Unfortunately, external speakers do not live up to its name. There is only one speaker and  in my opinion it is the weakest part of this phone. Speakers can be loud however do not expect Boom sound quality.<br /><br />Camera<br />I didn’t use the camera enough to write an educated review. However, it captures pictures very quick unlike Oneplus 2 which takes forever to snap a picture.<br /><br />Bottomline<br />ZTE Axon offers an exceptional value bundled in a metal unibody. For $449 with JBL headphones, this phone is a steal. It feels very premium inhand and its 3000mah battery is large enough to get anyone through an entire day. ZTE AXON is one of the greatest phones I have ever used including Oneplus2. ZTE blows Oneplus out of water by offering an excellent build quality, longer warranty, beautiful QHD display, and amazing Hi-Fi chip."
Amazing<br />Works great<br />inexpensive<br />Like new
"UPDATE: Props to the manufacturer/retailer for reaching out to me to resolve. Could have been a 1-off thing. For 10 bucks it's really no big deal. It does the most important thing, which is protect the phone.UPDATE<br />It's ok. Scratches way too easily. You can see a rainbow effect where it touches the new glass back of the galaxy s6 edge. Does protect it well though."
"Would work great if I didn't have a case that doesn't allow the phone to sit all the way down in the cradle to make enough contact to charge and such.  As such, I had to send it back as I want the case more than the dock."
"My phone fell, onto the street, out of a golf cart moving 20mph.  Have a couple scratches on the case and the phone is typing this message.  Highly recommend!"
"I built a cooler-stereo with these speakers and a head unit and the sound is awesome for the price.  Obviously when you turn the bass all the way up and the volume really really loud it's gonna get distorted but that's expected.  Overall I'm very pleased with these speakers and what I use them for.  And they have survived through 2 float trips (sand, water, craziness, etc)"
"After months of research, looking at Android and I Phone, I am very pleased with the Lumia 635. The Windows 8 (updated to 8.1 yesterday) has familiar features, helpful new apps, performs super fast and works with my WiFi at home. I am waiting on Consumer Cellular to send sim card for service and I will update after setup. Dec.18 2015 Update: Received sim card and still cannot send or receive pictures with text. Researched Windows online and called CC, no luck to date. Jan. 5 2016 Update: Solved send or receive pics with text problem. 8.1 update erased my MMS APN settings. I searched online and after several tries found the correct ones for this phone. APN is att.mvno  WAP gateway (URL) is proxy.mvno.ccmobileweb.com  WAP gateway port is 80  MMSC (URL) is http://mmsc.cingular.com/ MMSC port is 80 and IP type is IPv4."
No stars.... Very poor quality. It does not work!
For just a fraction of iPhone's and top Samsung models' price it is great!!!
Beautiful case. Looks exactly like the picture. Would do business again.
"I have two of these, and they sound great and hit hard for the money. Never had a problem with them on rms power. The guy comparing the EV8 is also comparing a $150 sub rated at 500rms, compared to a $25 sub rated at 250rms. They saying its weak and for a weak amp is right... Because that's what it's designed for. He most likely was clipping too bad and fried them."
"Delivered faster than expected. The quality of the case is OK, but for the price, I'd say its excellent value for money."
It takes two hands to read the time on this watch. The time is not displayed until you depress the button on the watch.
"I had one before and I returned it. I fretted forever over that decision and now I'm on my second. I love my Misfit! I'll never go without it again! I'm a Nike brand ambassador through and through, which is why I thought I'd rather have the Apple Watch to link with all my Nike Fuel and other Apple products. Turns out I really love Misfit."
"Worked well with my Galaxy S5 even with it's Otter Box case, but it was close to not fitting.  Found I had to tilt it and the tripod platform which was unexpected and initially daunting but did what I had hoped it would."
"Not a whole lot of options out there for the S6 active.  The phone is already very durable I just wanted a case that would protect the phone from scuffs, and scratches.  This case fits the phone perfectly and is not overly bulky.  I am confident this case will protect my phone quite nicely."
"Great Extended charger, my only compliant is that you have to be careful for sometimes the cap will loosen while your walking, same applies if its attached to your book bag, etc, all in all it can charge my phone for at least 3/4 hours nonstop, sure will be getting the newer version of Pebble when this one breaks/gets lost"
"The size is nice and easy to carry, the flashlight was def a great addition. It was very convenient to charge my phone for the two months that I had it."
"Was for my granddaughter's (age 12) birthday, gave her my iPhone 4s along with these cases $ accessories. She loved them!"
"This charger was only good for about five to six weeks, then it will no charge. I gad to purchased another one."
"The product did not work correctly when I received it, could not get a blue tooth connection with multiple devices and could not get SD card to read. However, when I contacted seller they were very quick to refund my money and extremely nice and easy to deal with."
"Perfectly adequate case.  Some silicone cases are too stretchy and too loose a fit to be useful, this one is soft plastic but stays on tight.  It is actually transparent, not white, and the return address label I put on the back of my phone (I'm always misplacing the thing) can be seen clearly through it.  My phone is white, and my real goal was to keep it white so I could find it black backpack pockets."
"Easy to apply. Standard process. Clean the phone screen, remove the first film on the screen protector, stick the screen protector on the phone, squeegee out the air bubbles, then remove the second film. Couldn't be simpler. These are smooth, responsive, quality protectors at an unbeatable price, and you can't even tell it's on my phone. Quite unobtrusive. I don't feel like there's anything between my finger and the screen. Glad to know my screen is safe from everyday nicks and scratches."
"Technology is solid and uber impressed with battery life, but the significant lacking of bass; made the Male siri sound like a tim can, I couldn’t take it any longer; had to return"
S6 plus  awesome  phone this case is perfect for the phone I highly recommend this case to protect your phone from drops
"This phone hangs a lot, even if the software is frequently updated this doesn't make any change in load of apps. Mainly while closing the camera it gives a worst hang."
"The reviews are the reason I bought these and didn't like them as soon as I tried them. They, as a guy, the cord is short and made of some rubber coating that sticks to everything. Every time I moved they came out. I could only imagine trying to workout in them. I don't believe all of the reviews on this."
These sound so much better than the stock speakers that came in my 2011 Ford Ranger. Just buy the correct speaker adapter for your vehicle and screw these in. Probably one of the most simple upgrades you can do to a factory vehicle audio system.
"everything mentioned about it was true.. its protected my iphone and i was able to recharge it and use it for a longer time.. the only thing that it is difficult to open it and take my iphone, it broke my nail many times!"
Great Android but my screen broke after 5 months.  Really worth the money.
"Great product and protects the cell unit very well. A bit more bulky than anticipated, but easy to deal with and does a great job when dropped. Color choice is very good as it catches the eye when left on a dark table or counter so you don't forget to pick it up which is all too easy with black. Highly recommended..."
"Perfect,  no complain. My husband really loves it, it's my gift to my husband. It holds the fone stands so stable on his car .thanks so much for your special offer and particular goods on Amazone.."
The in coming sound is excellent but people on the other end complain about the sound quality of my voice. For the price they are good for listening to music.
"Great cover, I would recommend this, not to bulky and looks great, very sturdy, I was riding my bike and got hit by a car and the case saved my phone"
Super fun and cute cover. I got a lot of compliments on it and I loved that it has a few card slots on the inside. The magnetic closure tab started to break down within a few months of regular use.
Cool case at a fair price
"Hi, I ordered for this item because I use my Sony xperia z2 mobile phone a lot, so I always need to charge it in order to continue using it. These normal chargers, charge slowly, hence I came up with an idea of looking for a quick charge.<br />That is when, I stumbled on this quick charge 2.0. I received it on time. At this time, by coincidence, the juice that was left in my phone was 27 %. So I tested it at this time.<br />Tell you what, I wouldn't believe it could charge my phone to 97%after one and a half hours time.<br />It's a good quick charger, I take this opportunity to recommended it to all my friends and colleagues."
"I only received 1 cover, I was led to believe it would be a pack of 5 covers.Also a small piece of microfiber would be nice for the installation.Thank You."
"Although it did take a while to arrive as it was sent from China (which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5), my daughter really likes it. It is not hard plastic but a semi flexible rubber. Colors are nice and vivid. Easy to put on and does a decent job protecting the phone. I will order more in different designs as the price is very reasonable."
"This case is awesome, feels great in your hands too. Super durable, I've already dropped my phone a few times and nothing has happened!"
"I bought this to use in our family room to replace the 4 or 5 chargers that are always in use for our phones, tablets, etc. So far work great and eliminated the clutter.  I wish it had a power indicator showing it is on, but other than that working daily fine for the few weeks I have had it."
Just what I was looking for and you can't beat the price.
"As a Trucker,and heavy equipment operator. I Wouldn't go without it. Most of my co-workers are also switching to the blueParrott. we have even tested it out standing right next to the motor running at high speed and the person on the other end could hear us perfect. very very low engine noise, just what we need, I would recommend this blueparrott to anyone"
"We have a several solar refreshed power bank batteries, and this is one of the larger capacity ones that we have tested. It is ruggedly stylish and has a functional design, and its 10000mAh capacity provides the juice needed for most situations.<br /><br />This unit's size (5.25 inches long x 2.75 inches wide and just 1/2 inch thick, weighing only 4.5 ounces) is perfect for stowing in your pack. I like this battery very much, but you have to have realistic expectations on the solar capabilities.<br /><br />The solar powered recharging capability is outstanding, though the manufacturer recommends that you reserve the use of solar recharging only for those times when you really need it and that you do not let the battery completely drain and try to recharge it with solar power.  Here's the deal though... the input rate for solar charging is just 200mAh (and that is assuming 100% efficiency). At 10000mAh, the math tells us that it will take, at a minimum, 50 hours of direct sunlight to charge this battery via the solar panel. 50 hours -- we probably average 5 or 6 hours of direct sunlight per day, so that would be 9 or 10 days of sun.<br /><br />Since the efficiency of solar charging could be 50%, the number of sunny days needed to charge this battery just from the solar panel could top 20 days.  BOTTOM LINE: Solar panel charging is not meant to be used as the primary charging source; it is meant to help you in an emergency, or to keep your unit topped off while out in the wild.<br /><br />The best thing to do is charge the power bank up in the traditional way, and them let it top off in the sun when you can.<br /><br />Upon receiving the battery, we plugged the unit into our Samsung S3's wall adapter and two of its four blue LED lights came on indicating that charging was taking place and that it arrived about 50% pre-charged. This unit's micro-USB port limits in-flow to 1A, so it took about 6 hours to finish charging the battery before all four lights were lit up.<br /><br />Operating this battery is simple -- the two ports sit at one end; one 1A and one 2A port. All you do is connect your device's USB cable to the battery and let it work. We found that the 2A port produced a charge rate of about 45% per hour (3/4% per minutes) while the 1A port had a charge rate of almost half that. These rates were in line with expectations from the specifications.  In addition, the retail materials note that the power bank is covered by a 1 year warranty.<br /><br />The only knock is that the rugged look is just that... a look; this power bank is made of hard, tough plastic, though it looks like it is made from sealed, rubberized material. We did not find an IP water resistance rating in the listing or the retail documentation.<br /><br />Solar charging capability, affordable, portable, and it does the job as described by the manufacturer.

"This charger performs like a champ and has saved me from many phone deaths over the course of my time with it.<br /><br />Charges my quick charge devices just as quickly as a wall charging port. My primary device, a Samsung Galaxy S6, has a 2600mA battery and will charge from 0% - 100% in just over an hour. All other devices charge well also, but will not charge as quickly. For example, an iPhone 6 1810mA battery will typically charge from 0% - 100% in 2 1/2 hours.<br /><br />Being that this charger is 10500mA, I get roughly 3 charges on my phone, which is amazing. I end up charging the charger itself every three days or so, seeing as the power does not drain from it over time.<br /><br />Extremely portable and easy to access, it now has a permanent place in one of the wallet holders in my backpack. I would recommend this product to anyone."
Really like this case!!! Thin but sturdy love the color & the feel of  the case buttons work great!  Covers the front edges of the  iPhone really well!!
"Kit is good, process is really really not easy, got done. Display was crystal clear messed up the speakers somehow though. Make sure you're more careful than I was."
Very high quality for the price. Would highly recommend it.
"Cheap, arrived fast, and it's been on my phone for two months now with no problems, aside from one random scuff on it when I got it in the mail."
"I'm updating my review. looks pretty but its very bulky. the size didnt bother me, what did is that the blue color started turning black from puting it in my pocket. after like two days. the case does seem to protect my phone well though. it also came with a stylus and screen protector. I would not recommend this to anybody though"
Very good product. Contains everything we need to work on my iphone 3.
The item is very sensitive the case broke within 2 days I will have to choose better next time.
Worked great for 2 weeks.  The ball joint is completely slippery and will not stay in position and just dangles down now.  there is no more friction in the ball joint.
I like this charger because it works MOST of the time. But sometimes when I plug it into my phone it doesn't charge.
"Ear buds dont stay in the ears, they are uncomfortable and eventually fall out, I have no idea how to use those two &#34;locking&#34; things as they are very soft/flimsy and dont seem to have any meaningful function(maybe I am using it wrong?)"
When I got the cases in they were great. As time went on the picture started to fade and the color started to come off. I don't know if it's because it was printed on or what the case might have been. I wish it had a glossy finish to it to where it didnt wear off so easily.
"This product is awesome, exactly what I expect, I haven't got my subs in to test it out yet, but it seems to be put together very we'll and I was really surprised to see it at my door step in 2 days instead of a weeks like I thought"
Great looking and exactly what I was looking for a case with a wallet. Carries cash drives license and about 4 credit cards.
"Great product, fast shipping."
"Good case but the back protector it came with was folded and didn't sit flat on the phone, I took off my zagg to replace it, wasn't a good idea."
for my set-up its the best thing since thing since sliced bread for playing my ipod and charging or keeping it charged at the same time
"The phone fits snugly in the case, there's absolutely no chance of slippage. I love the colour and so does my daughter. All the ports and sensors are easily available. My cards can fit easily into the slots - but I don't leave them there in case I lose my phone. I couldn't get the screen saver to line up properly so I discarded it (I was probably doing something wrong). Otherwise, I'm completely happy with the case and I've experienced no major difficulties"
The case and the pen it self are beautiful love it. Only downisde is the actual pen it doesnt write most if the time but i dont like gel pens anways so im just going to change the cartridge.
"I have had this phone just over three months, and it will no longer .  This is the second phone I have bought from Amazon within one year and both broke."
Did not pair with my Bowers & Wilkins bluetooth speaker but it works nicely with my headphones.
"Belkin is a good accessory maker and I have had good luck with their lightning cables in the past.  These are a bit more unique in that you can get them as a flat cable (instead of a round cable like the original cables are), or you can get a round cable with a 90 degree tip on it.  The cables themselves are an extra foot on the original 3 foot cables.  They also come in very bright and unique colors, which are fun."
"Amazing Product, Life saver! Super easy to use, light, great as protection case, I already dropped the phone a couple times and still intact! No more cables, or worries while using the GPS and running out of battery in the middle of the day."
Best USB cable i have  owned<br />Heavy duty and strong. Does not break at the USB port. Excellent buy.
"I purchased 4- 5packs of these screen protectors, 20 in all.  Out of the 20, 11 are defective.  There are &#34;tabs&#34; that instruct you to peel off an outer plastic sheet to expose the clean screen protector that goes face down on your phone.  I have 11 that have the tabs, but when you go to pull off the outer plastic sheet, there isn't one.  Instead there is only one piece of plastic that will not adhere to the phone.  Buyer beware!  This product is a rip off!!"
"a bit steep in price, but the sound is good for how small they are and they match my CM STORM mouse and keyboard perfectly!"
"Unit seemed to work OK with my Sansa Clip-Zip MP3 player. That is, until I plugged the USB charger in to charge it. When I do, it cuts the audio output from the MP3 player! It seems to charge OK, I just can't listen to music while I do.  I don't know if it is defective or not, but I am going to return it for something that will enable me to charge while playing.  UPDATE:  I bought a similar unit (Souldio™ With Micro USB Connector) and it does exactly the same thing with my Sansa Clip Zip. I also noticed if I had the USB connected to the MP3 player and touched the outside metal portion of the USB connector to a grounded metal part of the car, it would also cut the audio output. Apparently my two Sansa Clip Zips are grounded differently than most other electronic devices. But I can still use the unit, just can't charge while listening.  UPDATE: Merchant gave me a complete refund without having to return the unit. Excellent customer support, so I have upgraded the review based on that."
"yaaassssssssss fit my 2004 mazda 3 prefectly, be careful when mounting the crossover as it may be in the way of the door panel."
LOVE IT
"As an owner of multiple &#34;smart&#34; devices, I am not a fan of using my finger to scroll/navigate.  I LOVE styluses and own over 40 of them,  The Cambond 5-pack 2 in 1 click styluses are by far among the BEST that I've purchased.  I especially love the writing quality of the ink pen. A close 2nd is the vivid color of each stylus; gives them individuality and sets them apart from standard styluses. The size is perfect for my purse and lifestyle, not bulking or overbearing.  Very happy with my purchase, the speed of delivery (Prime), and the quality of the actual stylus.  It does what its meant to--eliminate fingerprints on my devices! Thank-you;-)"
Not fast and does not charge to 100%<br />It's just between 85% to 89%.<br />Sometimes shows its charging the phone but it's not.
First time NFC user and i am loving it... no issues whit the product...out of the box and working... the stickers are good quality and looks elegant... very happy with the product and the delivery time.. thanks..
"I wrote a feeback after I received 2 of a kind, saying they did not answer my questions on the shipping fees.  Actually, I am wrong.  I believe that I tended to comment on the other object.  I am very sorry.<br />In fact, this product is of very high quality,  my kids like them a lot.  The &#34;Money Pocket&#34; in the back is a good place for them to carry the student ID and some cash with.  Thanks lot!"
I really like the sleekness of this case but too scared to try the waterproof test because it does let dust in from my job. And headphone attachment only works if I tork it down really tight then I need a pair of needlenose plyers to get it off
"Good fit, but I can't charge my phone while the case is on. I have to take off my case everytime I need to plug it in."
Fit well.  Arrived as sold.  Good product.  Will do business with this vendor again.
"The protector &#34;glass&#34; was too inflexible to completely adhere to screen.  The protector did not adhere closely enough to seal edges, allowing it to be accidentally knocked off if something caught an edge.  Large voids were visible under the surface.  Product was returned for a refund."
Great otterbox . I've had it on my phone since I got it. Seen the same one in a t-mobile store  fr 20$ more.  Always buy  online
"The display works and looks great, I can't tell any difference from the original and it was fairly easy to replace.<br /><br />The only drawback is that I don't think it's exactly the same size as the original.<br />For the most part it fits fine, but it's started separating from the outside plastic and the screen rises to where there's a small gap that i can see between the lcd and the side of the body of the phone. It's most noticeable when the screen is on. I usually have my phone in a case, but if you carry it without, it might become an eyesore.<br /><br />Since the iPhone 5 is already a little old, I probably won't order another one to fix it."
"Smart watches are not a worthwhile purchase at this point and this is one of the 1st generation watches. It has bad screen resolution, bad battery life, a heart rate sensor that rarely works 1st time. The OS (Android Wear 1.3) janky and not very full featured. I would recommend spending a bit more on getting a newer generation snartwatch or waiting for smartwatch technology to improve before considering buying."
Very good screen protector. Can feel very little resistance compared to the actual screen. Very smooth. Only downside for me was that I couldn't get my bottom left corner to stick so I will probably be trying another one if it ends up becoming any worse.
"Does the job, but not exactly thrilled with the how the product was packaged.  It arrived in taped up cardboard.  I was expecting it have it's own personal product box, but was surprised to see that it was just a piece of cardboard folded up and taped up to carry it."
"the clarity is really nice and they work very well with music and other media. They are comfortable in the ears, you can actually wear them three different ways. with the ear curve under or over, or hanging in front up next to your next [they would be a bit more comfortable here if they had that little extra length on them]<br />the only complaint the I have is that the arms could be about a half inch longer and the colored silicone has been lifting out of it since day one! [lose 1 star]"
It's way to thick and I can knock the screen on also the plugs for headphones and charger have ripped off
"Exactly what I wanted. Light, thin case to give the phone more grip yet not take away from the look of the phone. The pink is very cute!"
"I give them 5 stars as these are a pretty solid set of buds. Now I sweat a lot and I have been trying to find a set that actually hold up to the water resistant/proof statements all of these companies make. I have tried numerous buds and found NONE to be what they say and NONE have held up at all. So now to find a set that actually work well, sound pretty good, don't fall out I have been pretty happy. I wear them 4-6 days a week for 2-3 hours and have had no issues.<br /><br />Well after a little over 2 months of wearing these units the battery crapped out and will only hold about an hour. I have attempted to contact Photive directly twice now and have received NO response. Too bad, still can't find a decent set of Bluetooth ear buds that last! If Photive gets back to me I will update this review.<br /><br />******UPDATE*******<br />Received an RGA from Photive, shipped the defective unit back to them on 9.19.15, for a replacement, nice of them to offer a no hassle way to replace the defective unit."
The product doesn't work. It will cost me more to return them than to throw them out and cut my losses.
"Halo effect...crazy. Third attempt with three different vendors...I thought this one would be different, as it advertised, but it is clear, that the phone is the issue!"
"Works great! It is mounted on the windshield of a 33,000lb single axle dump truck and even though it can be a rough ride at times, i have never had any issues with it staying in place. Its fully adjustable and stays tight. I would highly recommend it to someone else."
Perfect for iPhone 6.
"I truly loved the case, I was very pleased with it. The case fits really good on the phone, soft touch and for sure will protect my phone.  No problems on the following:  pressing my off-  botton, plugging my headphones and plugging the charger. Some cases are nice, but have issues on the stuff I mentioned. Excellent! I highly recommend."
This works really well in my car. I use it with an iPhone 6 with a thin case on it. My only wish is that I had bought a longer cord but 3ft works fine.
"Great charger, except the phone is hard to remove with one hand. You can't remove the phone with one hand or the whole dock will move."
Does not fit my phone..very very  disapointed..it is to wide and just slips out😪...Do not recommend😪and will probably cost more to return it so I will donate it...not the way I like to do business!!
Fast shipping and the battery last me from 7a.m. - 7p.m. with heavy use. Anker has some of the best customer service around as well. Thank you
Like many other respondents the find your friends feature is useless. We live in Utah and the mountains limit this feature to less than a quarter mile. Buy yourself a cheap light weight garmin and forget about finding your friends or talking to them. You can probably do this with a satellite device but plan on paying a monthly fee just like your cell phone. Someone from Colorado wrote in and said it worked in the mountains there. That was the sole reason I purchased it. They were either lying or perhaps they lived in far eastern Colorado. I am mostly angry because a company like Garmin has lied to everyone.
I like the buttons to forward or reverse to a song. I like how it looks pleasing to the eye even though its something sticking out of your dashboard. only con is that the music doesn't always play clean and crisp. you sometimes hear noises and the music is low. but for the price and the fact I don't have the money to purchase a 500.00 plus dollar setup than this Stream but is well worth it.
Nice as expected
"I recently bought this case, I've been looking everywhere for it since I could only find it for 5S or 6, so I was really excited when I found it for the 5C. The color is great and it's beautiful, but just after 3 days of having it, it started to become dirty from where I held it. I'm a little disappointed it became dirty so fast, especially because I clean my phone every day. I take care of my things really well, like I have Ugg Boots that people think are still brand new when I've actually had them for 7 years now. My phone still looks brand new, no cracks or anything like my other friends. So again, a little disappointed it became dirty so fast."
"I honestly cannot decide if I like this or not.<br />I like the idea of it, I think that if when I received it and it was more like this picture; hence, everything wireless, I would have liked it that way - it would have given more freedom. they do play well and it connects to your cell phone.<br />You also have the ability to rewind and forward media, this might work on Voice mail as well I don't know."
Bought two of these cases in army green for myself and my daughter.  We both love it!  Very attractive and provides good protection with a nice lip and non-slip surface on the back.  Looks great on both the black and white iPhones.  Very happy with our purchases!
"Great fit, great look, great grip/feel. Smooth material and arrived in 4 days. Highly recommend if u have this phone. I hope to get another type of phone soon, but this case gets the job done!"
"PRO's  : Product looks very stylish and fits phone perfectly.  Credit card tray does hold two cards and case is very well designed and looks like it would protect the phone if I dropped it.<br /><br />CON's : With this Case on, my phone will not wireless charge with the Laniakea wireless charger I purchased.  A buddy at work has another charger at work and I will see if his works with this this case."
Red light does not turn to blue  when fully charged like it says in the owners manual.  But it did recharge my phone.
"Great cover, really affords me a lot more grip. I can feel all the buttons easily without having to look at the player and it looks really good in black!"
I have two styluses that have replaceable tips and this is the brand they use.
Best iphone case I have ever bought. I have dropped my phone 100's of times and it remains safe and secure. Very well built case and worth your buck.
"I love owls. This owl design was so cute, I just had to have it."
Garmin discontinued cellular service program and leaves this device useless. No alternative made by Garmin to track the device.Garmin used to be known for good products and customer service. It appears as though they threw in the towel when it comes to backing up their products.
I absolutely loved this case. My only problem is it turned a brown-ish color after a few months of use. Now it looks incredibly dirty even when I try to clean it.
Surprisingly efficient screen covers for the low cost. Nice.
Phone case arrived on time and was delivered in good condition. The phone case provided excellent coverage. The phone case is slim enough to fit in my back pocket without being bulky.
"The batteries are great and give me a day and a half on a regular basis and I play a lot of music and check the web regularly. The charger is rather useless if you want your battery charged fast. It's much faster to charge on my S5. It takes a good seven or eight hours for the charger to fully charge and only an hour on my phone. So, I recommend the batteries very highly."
"Excellent product. Easy to set up and connect. It's compact, light and easy to store in my bag with my phone. Only thing is you need your own USB cable to connect to your phone. I'm using this with my iPhone 5 and haven't had a problem yet."
"I was really excited about this product, but as soon as I put my hands on it, I got frustrated. Well, it is well build, cushions are nice, sound ok.<br />But this headphones puts to much pressure on my ears, and I got headaches in 10 min, that was the major problem for me. The sound is ok, I missed a little treble and the bass has distortions. I couldn't pair this with my ps4, it says it couldn't find a profile for it. EVEN IF YOU PLUG THE AUX CABLE IN THE PS4 CONTROLLER IT WONT WORK THE MIC.<br />Returning the unit."
Unfortunately I could not get this phone holder to stay on the dashboard and have returned it. I like the way it was designed but it didn't work for me.
Horrible absolutely horrible. I dropped my phone from a short distance and all around the edges it broke right away and then shattered the edges OF MY PHONE. IT DID NOT PROTECT IT AT ALL. so now I have a shattered phone.
I received a discount for an unbiased honest review.<br />This auxiliary cord does its job.<br />I mainly use it for my vehicle with my stock stereo system.<br />I love the length of the cord so the passengers in the back seat can play their music as well.<br />The cord is made with high quality materials and does not feel like it will get into tangles.<br />That's a huge plus.<br />I highly recommend this cord for those in the market for it.
"I wish it covered the entire phone so it wouldn't crack but it falls, the case doesn't cover the top and bottom of the phone, just the sides. But it is a very cute case."
"Good product for the price, the blackened overlay is peeling off, leaving the white design. Could use a better coating process."
"Bought this because the bag that I'm using for my pro gear is too small, and I was tired of crushing my headset. The bag is well made, and is perfect for carrying a headset. I now clip it to my backpack with a carabiner, and it fits my needs perfectly."
"This a great product as it fluctuates from 3G to 4G LTE automatically. The 10 device limit is fine for most people. Unfortunately I bought this after talking to Verizon about remaining on my plan, they lied as I was unable to keep my present unlimited plan, even though I was told at the Verizon store my plan was still unlimited. So be careful, If you have an unlimited 3G plan, keep it. This is the wrong device then. I am however keeping the device, as the price of data goes down, who knows maybe I can use it."
After about 1 month of using this the whole gold paint pealed off now the case looks all old ald used not a good case if you want it to last looking good. Overall the case protects your phone real well which is what counts in the long run.
"I met a seller who offered me this device as for a promotional item in exchange of my honest review, all the statements here are mine alone and never was affected by the seller. The product is great if you, like listening to the radio during road trips, the volume is decent not to loud and not too soft. It works great on both of my iphone and Samsung."
"Fit as expected and it seems quite durable, especially for a 13 year old. I liked the price and it seemed appropriate with the quality. I bought this phone cover for my stepdaughter who loves Dr Who and she LOVES IT! :)"
"i use the Joto case anytime I go on vacation to the beach, or when I visit the lake. I have dropped the case in the water when loading the boat and retrieved it with no damage/water in the case.<br /><br />This product comes with a lanyard for additional protection.<br /><br />You can also use your smart touch phone with this case!! Even if I didn't have a touch phone, I would put anything I need to protect in it. Documents, cards, ID.. Ect."
It works for Sandisk 8GB Clip Jam MP3 Player.
Exactly as described.  Good quality and it fit perfectly.
"Took a long time to arrive, but that was not unexpected. My granddaughter liked it for a friend. Cute. Fit the Apple phone. Definitely pink. Strap is a bit chintzy, but the price was very low, so no surprises here."
I had dropped my galaxy s5 and charging port broke so this was best way to charge.can take it's time charging depending on everything that you have on phone but got the job done
"The [[ASIN:B013WE0ZPA Lightning/Micro USB Charging Cable by Masasei]] is a two in one solution for those like me who work with devices that charge via Lightning and Micro-USB. The cable looks pink on screen, but in person it's more red.<br /><br />Love the flat design of this cable, it's not just a cool design feature, it also functions to help keep the cable tangle resistant, and it really works. As mentioned, the cable has both Lightning and Micro-USB connectivity on the end. The primary adapter is Lightning and by sliding it down I then have access to the Micro-USB connector. Worked for charging and data transfer on my iPod 5, Android Phone and Kindles (both fires and readers).<br /><br />Overall, excellent solution for those who use different charging devices to keep a single streamlined cord. It's working great for me.<br /><br />[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]"
"I am giving this two stars, because when it worked...it was awesome. I had it about three weeks, and it just stopped working. I replaced the batteries (it requires two $6 batteries), and it still didn't work. The return policy is a joke. It quit working right after the return window closed, so now I have a useless item."
"- Clear & loud<br />- decent distant (within 1 mile for sure - neighborhood, camp ground)<br />- reasonable price<br />- Keeps charge well<br />(come with ear piece but have not used)"
"I like this case except for one thing.  The clip goes on the front of the iPod only.  As a result you have to take the clip off everytime you use your iPod.  I would like to see the clip go on the back of the ipod instead, that way you could just leave the clip on."
This is the 5th cover in two months different company par. Good thing they r cheap to buy!
This is a nice thin armor case and I really do love it. I got it as a gift for my sister and she loves it as well. She doesn't like anything bulky on her phone that would cause extra weight. This case is very lightweight but does the job of protection. The corners curve a little more so you have that extra protection should your phone drop. It's so easy to install. There's nothing to it. Just snap on your phone. Secure the corners by going all the way around and you are all set. The gray is a pretty gray also. It has a sleek shiny look to it. Real fancy I must say. This is a very well made protective case despite it's thin. I was given this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and would gladly recommend it. I would definitely buy at full price. I am very pleased with and I'm sure you would too. Great product. Great choice!!!!
Great case. Fits great on my nokia 925.  Stand works perfect when I want to stand up my phone. Excellent product.  I would buy it as again.  The closer is magnetic and will stay in place.
I Purchased this battery charger a few months ago ..and I must say it has done a great job so fare I work for the postal service as a mail handler and I need my phone for music because it can get a little overwhelming some days until all the trucks are In ..once that happens I can watch movies that is when I need the extra boost ..it keeps my phone charged without any problems at all ..and the good thing is I can share with someone else as well because of the dual charging port ..funny thing is I have a problem holding onto things so.I.have dropped this a few times and it shows and it still works just like it did when I first received it ..so would I recommend this ..100 precent I would with no problem ..One thing I didn't care for was the size of  it ..it reminds me of a note4 cell phone in size but other then that its really nice ..This is my honest review ..I work hard for my money I'm sure you people do as well Trust me if you can get past the size you will get a great charger...by the way my kids had it in a read trip a month ago they used it to charge there phones amd ipods there and back without charging it ..so that should tell you something about how good it is ..later .
Great!!! Thank you!!!
It's great.  Slim case and the purple color is somewhat see through which I like.
"I do not have big biceps, and the band ripped after only a few days of use. Due to the lifetime warranty and other positive reviews, I am giving it another chance and will update this review in time."
When my case arrived it was exactly like the picture I w as very satisfied with my purchase got many compliments would buy from this seller again
So far so good. I use this to charge my s5 and my wife can also use it to charge her s4 when we trade cars.
Very  good  product and I got it delivered in a short time.
"This car mount phone holder is easily to assemble and attach. Phone is secure, and you're driving without putting other's in harm's way. I would definitely recommend this product."
"If you travel around and have two devices, this is for you. My phone and tablet always need charging at the end of the day and they both use USB. This includes headsets, keyboards, phones, and tablets. 2 ports at 2.4 amps are perfect for my needs. The smart ports charge my phone and tablet fairly quickly. I don't have a volt measure but it does charge 2x faster than my OEM charger. I also use this at home where I feel I need charging ports all over the place. iPhones have the worst battery ever.<br /><br />Charger was provided for review by RAVPower"
"I agree with the user that said unless there is a way to get different gels these are worthless. I have a 20 year old Walkman headset with 10 times the sound.These have NO bass at all unless you can hold them in with your hands all day. I find it discouraging that Motorola would put these on the market as tinny as they are, everything else about them is fine but sound sucks. Apps do nothing but kill your phone output in order to make it sound like it did something, All the bass apps are garbage, they do nothing to compensate for this headsets total lack of performance."
"I was offered this Selfie Stick as part of a special promotion and didn't expect much, just a stick to attach your phone to and take pictures. But this product surprised me! The Bluetooth connection makes it super easy to snap photos and even if you stretch out the pole all the way, the stick is still sturdy. I have an iPhone with a big case, so I wasn't expecting the fit to be that great, but again I was proven wrong. My phone slid right into place and fit securely. Definitely bringing this product on our next family vacation!"
lighter plug pivots which means I can move the receptacles at almost any angle.  This proved very useful for me because my lighter receptacle is near the shift lever.  I rotated the plugs at a right angle and everything clears just fine.
Great product
"Had upgraded from another stand alone GPS to Garmin. Pros/Cons: 1. Good interface once understood -vs- as I said once understood. 2. HD traffic worth the price -vs- though just yesterday (8/29/2015, 1:04am) waited 30 minutes at the entrance of Lincoln tunnel with no mention on the traffic bar, faced the same problem several times, though the HD traffic is supposed to update quite frequently.  3. Acquires Satellites to begin with -vs- does lose it randomly in midtown Manhattan. (Waze & CoPilot running on iPhone do not lose the signal). 4. Good routing -vs- though rerouting of Waze/CoPilot app are much faster. 5. Junction view looks nice -vs- but when the junction view is 'on' the other left half visual loses relevance.  6. Map updates are really not up-to-date. Reed road in Hillsborough, NJ and the surrounding area of gated community still not on the map though the area must have been developed a couple of years before. (Waze app shows all the inside roads). Desirable upgrades: Would give 5 star with these desirables. 1. Junction view should not divide the screen, as it becomes difficult to focus while driving and trying to pin point the exit in a multi exit area. 2. There are score of streets in Manhattan, NYC that have permanent no entry/turn with reference to time between 10am to 6pm, such information would be worth its value in dollars for thousands of commercial drivers on the move in Manhattan, NYC. And a majority uses Garmin, let it be a FIRST by GARMIN. Most will be willing to pay extra for this very important information, wherein Garmin GPS navigates taking no turn/entry into consideration. 3. The Dash Board must have provision to accommodate at least one more relevant information of choice (like Speed/ETA/Distance together) 4. Bluetooth headset should be able to pair directly with the gps without the need to connect it through a smartphone, this would give the advantage of getting the direction in earpiece in stead on the gps speaker, which can be annoyingat times."
"Works great in my 2012 Toyota Highlander with my Samsung S4.  Doesn't seem to work as well in my 2013 Ford F-150, but I attribute that more so  to vent design of the truck, but would be nice if it did work better.  The grippers could be just a little but longer."
What a good deal. The S11-Flex HD Wireless Headset are all they are cracked up to be. Fine for listening to your favorite music while running.
"Safe and secure. I've had other iPhone mounts for my bike, but this one is the best so far. I like the secure mount for the phone that doesn't interfere with the display or the use of the touchscreen."
"Great tool for travel, airports and planes, I don't leave home with out it, I know I made a great buy."
"This case is going on a few years of use and still looks great. It's holding up the same as the day it arrived. Fits some additional documents in the front, not really big enough for anything more than a charging cable."
I got this case because there weren't many wallet style cases for the s6 edge. When I ordered it I wasn't that excited about it. Now that I've had it for about a month I really like it. My only issue is trying to get the phone out of the case if you want to switch it up.
"This battery worked great for about 3 months. Then, out of nowhere, I received a yellow triangle with a question mark when plugging in the charger. No problem, I thought, I'll just email ZeroLemon because there's a 6 month warranty! Got a replacement, CS was great, but it too displayed this error.<br /><br />Now let me add in that the OEM battery works fine with the phone. This battery shows the error with and without the case. Nonetheless...<br /><br />Emailed them again, got another replacement, same issue. It's too late for a refund, but regardless, I'd like a working battery!"
Didn't fit right in my ear. Also wasn't the best sound quality
Terrible product. I thought I'd try an alternate to the Spiegen case that I had. Bad idea. The biggest problem is how loose it fits over the iPhone 6. The material feels cheap and plastic. Why is there a clear window in the wallet side? It doesn't allow you to see the entire ID if that's the purpose.  This just isn't a good product.
Excellent product!  Wonderfully packed and directions were great!  It really enhances the screen on my phone!
Awesome phone with nice big everything and all the must have for a cell phone.
Great screen protector.  Follow the easy directions and you'll have no bubbles!  No problems with the order and everything was packaged well.
"Lost my charger, so happy to have a replacement!  Thanks#"
Love Speck cases. As usual they don't disappoint. My last case lasted over 3 years. I just wanted a new one for looks. Great protection for my iPhone. Thank goodness since I've dropped it too many times to count. Including down concrete stairs.
This came looking just like the picture. The case feels durable and the picture of Jon Bon Jovi was very clear. Love having this case on the phone and showing off my favorite member of the band. :)
"I do love these for the length and the cute colors but why do they disconnect so readily? There must be some techie reason. I need someone to tell me! [Update: apparently there is NO reason for the easy disconnect, it's not a deliberate design element, haha.]<br /><br />Update: The ones I got were pink, blue, purple. They still disconnect really easily, but they do function. I'm keeping the 4 star rating bc their customer service is excellent. They got in touch w me right away and offered a refund. I see they offer a similar product that's red black white. I wonder why they didn't just substitute that set? Regardless, my current ones are working for me and they were basically free, so no complaints. I would definitely purchase from this company again, w no reservations, just based on their customer service alone."
"This Iron Armor Clear phone case fits my iphone 6 phone like a glove! It actually allows me to grip my phone easier because it squares the edges a bit more than the rounded edges of the iphone 6. It has protective covers for the charging port and the port you plug your headphones into, so you don't have to worry about dirt, sand or any little pieces getting in them. Plus, I LOVE how it's clear and you can see the gold on the back of my iphone 6. I got it because it was gold and this case allows me to see it instead of covering up the gold I love so much. I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review."
Plastic screen covering is destorted
"Works very well. I have seen other &#34;selfie sticks&#34; that have not worked very well, this one is flawless. It works every time you press the button and it's quick too (meaning there isn't a delay between when you press the button and picture actually takes). Overall great product."
Protector fit screen well.  After about two weeks protector began to peel away from one corner and is slowly getting worse.
Easiest application yet and I didn't get a single bubble/pocket. I've ordered several different brands from Amazon and this one far surpassed my expectations. (I go through the temp glass covers like candy) burbs rather the screen protector than the actual screen! Comes with actually good assistance dust remover and cloth and went on SO EASY and stuck right away. I have had several glass installed myself with the other ones previously bought and ALWAYZ get a air bubble in the corner. And if you don't get it right the first time you are just SOL or at least I have been in my previous. I just got the m9 and am ordering this brand again. I was that impressed :D
This is exactly what we needed and it works perfectly with the IPhone 6 plus. It is very durable and easy to use. The case hooks to your belt or waist of your pants and then the phone just snaps right in. No hassles.
"Tight fit but it fits!  My Note 4 has a Verus Case and it is snug...the case is quite bulkier then if without it.  The 2 snap closures and top plastic seem flimsy so unsure and untested yet if truly waterproof.  Till then, 3 stars."
"On time delivery, good service, product description very accurate. Thank you."
"This product says it is apple certified. After usung it for about 6 weeks, my iphone now has a message saying, using a non compatible component and the phone wont charge. It isnt a cheap wire. I dont get it. And now it is non returnable. I felt i was sold a non usuable item by this company. Beware before buying this charging wire."
"Product performs as described.  Great audio quality, long battery life, good interface with my iPhone and laptop for Skype and super comfortable to wear for long periods, much better than over the ear and the Apple ear buds.  When it looks too geeky it fits under my shirt collar and I don't have to put it in my pockets."
"Fits nicely. It may obscure a pixel or two around the edge of the screen, but it definitely makes me feel better about those moments where I bump or scrape my 360 against something. I haven't had any problems interacting with the touch screen with this on."
supper easy to install. the image is great day or night i don't know why others are complaining about the quality. i have this on my cargo van and it just perfect for my needs.
"While I appreciate being able to purchase the port cover and have it arrive timely, it frustrates me that the manufacturer doesn't fix the problem  and eliminate the need for replacement parts so early in the life of the phone."
The wallet/stand broke pretty early. Only a few weeks. But it came in handy a few kayaking trips to lanyard the phone.
"Case looks nothing like the picture.  Case is a cheap plastic case with a bad, faded sticker on the back.  DO NOT BUY FROOM THIS SELLER.  RIP OFF AND WILL NOT USE"
"This is a great case until the buttons for,power and volume  fall off.  I love the look of the cases, and it protects the phone very well without being bulky, but the buttons fall off if you drop it."
Got this to replace an ineffective tempered glass protector that did nothing to stop my phone from shattering except crack a little in sympathy. Seems decent quality for the price but you have to be a ninja to put this on properly aligned with no moisture underneath on the first try- maybe get it put on for you?
"Pros:  - Provide high protection - Looks nice, made from good materials  Cons:  - I don't like it, it seems very slim in the photo but in the reality it does add a notable weight to the phone. - The combined screen protecter affects the screen sensitivity badly and there is a distance between it and the phone screen. - The screen protector looks like it has been made of cheap plastic and any one could notice it. - The price is high when we considering these cons.  Overall, I don't like it,  and I would suggest for anyone who want buy it, to go for the one which made by &#34;New Trent&#34;, instead.  UPDATE (23/9/2015): I have to mention that Anker's customer service is really AMAZING! , they contact me and give me the choice of getting a full-Refund or another case for free. I got full refund, therefore I gave them another *star for the amazing After-Sale customer service."
"The Permachager works with everything you need to charge. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great way to keep your phone etc in working condition,"
"My first experience with solar.  Easy to operate and juice up phone, etc. for camping, biking, boating and such.  Small size makes it a cinch to carry anywhere.  Bought it at the same time as UNIFUN 10400mAh USB External Travel Battery.  Same review for that, too.  The flashlight is super handy and BRIGHT!"
The capacity of the battery is not good completely. I think it is used for a long period of time.
Best stereo  Ive listen  to in a long while. Easy to in stall also.
"The seller is great to work with, and this is a high quality product. The only problem is no wrist strap included. There is a place for one though."
"It's pretty neat, but the thing does tend to fall apart. I had to use electrical tape to fix it."
"Very nice phone. Everything works smoothly, Music and pictures are great. My only observations are that for some reason not all my google contacts are showing the contact picture. Could not figure it yet. Still deciding if using the HTC Gallery app to manage images or use photos from Google."
Great value! Exactly what I was looking for and expected.
"The items was to arrive in a week, bur actually arrive two days early.  It looks just as pictured and was easy to install.  I had to check uTube a couple of times to ensure i was taking out hte old system correctly, but other then that it was a smooth installation."
Can't beat this case for the money. Love the kickstand!
"Love it , kids say I'm hip"
"The Bonazza lightning-fast Universal dual USB port car charger is a rapid charging device that has a LED loop that displays voltage, current, and temperature. It turns in a complete circle which aids in being easy and convenient to use. The charger has a built-in self-healing fuse that prevents overcharging, overvoltage, undervoltage, short circuit, overcurrent, overload, and excetera. It can charge more than your phone like cameras, MP3 players, tablets, and even more. The LED displays a green light which makes it visible day and night. I have put it in my husband's truck because he has chargers that are finicky and don't always work. This charger is working well and very quickly charges his phone. I have used it to charge my camera and tablet. These were charged fast and could also be used while being charged. I received this charger in exchange for my review, however, my opinion is my own an unbiased.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Purchased this for my wife's new Galaxy Note and she really likes it.  Provides great protection for her phone and the clear screen cover that comes with it keeps the phone nice and clean.  If this is a bonus, it is EASY to find if she leaves it sitting around the house anywhere!  We just look for &#34;Pinky&#34; since it don't blend in with much!"
"I love this case! It fit perfectly and looks elegant; not bulky yet sturdy enough that it protects my S6. The cell phone tends to be too sleek and slippery for its own good, so the case makes it easier to handle it. At first it was hard to access the side slots to rise/lower the volume or turn the phone on/off, but I got used to simply using my nail or the tip of my finger. I'm glad"
"This is a great portable charger.  I didn't get an instruction booklet with mine, but most of its function is intuitive.  The one question I had about charging the unit was answered promptly by the manufacturer.  I would recommend this product.  Good quality."
My friend recommended this cover and swore by it. I realize that she was spot on. I love it!
"does the job, purchased 8 of these to wire the 8 passenger van so the kids had usb charging ports and audio jacks if they wanted to hear the movie that is playing on the five monitors throughout the van.  Great for traveling"
"Very tight to get phone in and out of, but that can be a good thing as well. I have found a way to get it in and out, but not without practice"
Ordered two chargers & one came in defected so they immediately sent me another one...FosPower went above & beyond to make sure their customers are satisfied!!!! The chargers are super compact & charge my cell phones quickly!!!!
"UPDATE:<br />I dropped this review down from 4 stars to 1 star. I had this case for about two weeks and my overall impression is that it is a NIGHTMARE to remove. A lot of force and scary pressure have to be applied in order to remove it--I absolutely hated that. A case should be at least SOMEWHAT easy to remove, you shouldn't have to mangle your phone and struggle in order to simply take it off.<br /><br />Another thing: if you want to use a screen protector, don't get this case. Because this case is so stupidly tight, what it does is it literally scrapes your protector off of the screen. I had a very nice Skinomi protector that worked flawlessly until I got this case.<br /><br />I got the blue version of the case (advertised as &#34;Electric Blue&#34;). It's not the same hue you see in the pictures, it's lighter and less saturated.<br /><br />One thing that I didn't like was the amount of time it took to ship, and the complete failure of tracking the shipment that occurred. I ordered this case on August 23rd, and I have received it via standard shipping on August 29. I suppose that's okay for standard shipping, but the tracking was awful. It said it was shipped via DHL Global Mail, despite the fact that Googling the provided tracking number revealed it was a USPS tracking number. When I looked on USPS, there was no information posted about the order for two whole days, then it suddenly said &#34;Arrived Shipping Partner Facility&#34; and over the next few days I only got vague updates on what was going on. I didn't have any idea of when it was to be delivered, and I was expecting it to be sometime next week, but it appeared on my doorstep this morning with no warning. As I am writing this review, Amazon still doesn't know I have the package and it's been delivered.<br /><br />I hope this company finds a better way to ship their packages, because this was kind of a stupid experience. The product they sold, however, wasn't bad at all despite the misleading hue in the picture. It's a decent case, but I was hoping for the color to more closely mimic the dark blue of the Black Sapphire S6 Edge+. It still looks alright, though, and it feels good, so I'm keeping it.ping for the color to more closely mimic the dark blue of the Black Sapphire S6 Edge+. It still looks alright, though, and it feels good, so I'm keeping it."
"I like the color of the of the danforce armband. It has two pockets, for your phone and for keys or money. The front is plastic so you can easily see if you have any notifications on your phone. One thing that needs improvement is the velcro of the strap. It needs to have a velcro that will stick really good. But overall it is a good product. I received this product in a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review."
"So far so good! Don't really need the digital information it gives but it's nice to have anyway. Dual ports are fantastic. Sturdy feeling, but although the swivel is supposed to be a plus, I find it harder to plug in - I would prefer a non-swivel. However, still recommended."
Item came in on time. Screen is up to its name. Be warned doesn't cover phone. Because it's suitable for cases.
These have to be the worst headphones I have ever heard. I received them today and are sending them back today. Headphones that ship with ipods are ten times better than these. I am shocked that anyone can say these have a good sound. You have to shove them so far down your ear canal to hear any base at all. Unbelievably poor! I have never in my life been so disappointed by a product more than this one.
One of the best things. I loved it when I started using it but now it turns off all of a sudden for no reason. I dont like that part.
"I'm happy with the quality of this case, but note that the color is more of a light blue than mint green as the photos suggest.  A little disappointed since mint green is my favorite color, but it's still very nice!"
"Poor screen sensitivity, and it made the screen blurry, after about 3 days it started to release from the phone."
Just a classic case!! It looks good and the quality is also awesome!
"Awesome 3.0 hub for supporting more drives and more devices, although it has its limitations that it specifies. I however have 4 flash drives, 1 external drive with another hot swap drive powered by 2 usb ports, a tablet and phone, and more things that may require a usb port. I could say things have been more convenient when it came to charing my tablet and phone at the same time without removing one of my many devices at night.<br />PS. you may not be able to connect a device that uses 2.4 Ghz wireless communications on it, but I plugged in a bluetooth adapter to it, and it worked. But I would still use a different usb port to fully utilize this hub and the bluetooth adapter."
"USB 3 works great.  Provided plenty of extra ports to use with external drives, etc.  Power ports change my Galaxy S5 the same as the normal wall charger would."
The design was all over the place so it doesn't look nice.
A necessary item to record heat rate with Garmin 500. Supplied one from bundle only worked for 6 months . The new one is working perfectly so far.
"Works great! My husband is a rancher, so he takes his phone everywhere and this case has helped protect his phone from everything. Definitely recommend!"
Great case but magnet not strong enough to use side card holder for no more than I'd and one cr fit card.
"I'm used to aviation headphones which the ones i have are kind of builky. After finding a free trial of these in the mail i tested them out. They sound great, like 360 degrees of surround sound. They do collaspe which is great for my flight bag in case i have a passenger."
Item is simple to use and has a very simple display which works great for me!
"Great feel and protection. Has the grip areas only where one needs it when holding phone. Easy to slip into pocket. Keeps phone pretty slim for such great corner protection. It's the slimmest, protective case I could find."
"Very nice looking case, slim and fit perfectly when it worked. This case is very slippery, not much protection which is expected. Case cracked and started falling apart on two different location after 2 months of moderate use. Move on to different case now."
"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
I used this with a car adapter. Well built and love that it rewind instead of having a long hanging cable.
Best case for my g3. Its perfect for watching...the kickstand is awesome so i dont have to hold it and worry that it will fall. Protects my phone well although i havent tested dropability.
"I tried the case that had a screen protector built into it and when I would work out, my sweat would get between the watch and the protector so I ordered these.  It was easy to install and worked great even during work outs.  I ended up replacing this with film based protectors so even the beveled area would be protected."
I bought my first one 1 1/2 years ago. Broke a piece the other day and immediately ordered a replacement. Yes it takes 2 hands to remove the phone for awhile. After it breaks in it can be removed with one hand. The cover that goes on the phone allows you to grip the phone securely.
"Bought the white one too, wife waned one also but could not remember what color she wanted.  Turn out I made a good pick, that was the color she wanted,  I would of use the white one if not. a Win Win !  Haven't used the extra port yet but it's there when I am ready."
"My case arrived with scratches on the outer edges, showing the light gray base material, but the case fit fine and has performed well. Pretty happy with my purchase, as it was very inexpensive. Worth the cost."
They shipped quickly and worked perfect! Would definitely purchase from Trusted Cables again...really like their customer service.
"Works well. Attached to dashboard, very sturdy.<br /><br />Case with two possible ways of making your phone attach to the magnet (1) a metal plate that goes under your phone cover and (2) a sticky insert that you can attach to your phone. This makes it so that you can use two phones with this magnet with the included supplies, which is really helpful."
"Worked perfect. I dropped my phone recently and the glass protector shattered but my phone screen was unharmed. I hate the tactile feel of most screen protectors, but the glass one you never even notice it's there."
"This is my first Alpatronix case, and I bought it knowing the case will add bulk to the slim s6 due to the extended battery. I wish the case is slimmer, but it is what it is.  I have 2 big issues with the case: 1) The product description says &#34;The automatic circuit protector deactivates the case when your phone is fully charged, saving the extra battery juice for later use&#34; ---- however, I've used it twice so far since my purchase and confirmed when my phone charges to 100%, the case battery does not deactivate and it continues to charge. The charge signal is still on my phone even at 100% until I manually turn it off, then it shuts off and go away. This is not working as advertised, and I am a bit annoyed at that.  2) I've read reviews stating using the fast charging cable that came with the S6 does not allow for the case and phone to be charged, so I've been using the cable that came with the case. After my first use where I've drained the case and the phone down to low battery, I left it plugged into the S6 wall charger (using the cable provided with the case) overnight. When I woke up, the phone was not charged at all, and the case was also just blinking with 1 LED indicator. It was almost 7 hours of being plugged in, but it didn't seem like anything charged. The reviews said it would charge the phone first then the case if I use the cable provided, but my phone's battery went down and my case battery didn't move. I disconnected the case from the phone and charged them separately - when I do this, the case will charge which is not working as advertised. I just plugged it in again right now after draining it - once I plug it in, it will say &#34;charging&#34; on my phone but then the charging sign quickly goes away. I see it plugged in with the phone case LED indicator at 1 light blinking for the past hour, so I'm not sure if the case is charging. However, as advertised, I believe the phone should be charging FIRST before the case and the fact that the phone is not charging at all doesn't give me much comfort. I will go ahead and leave it plugged in overnight to see if it actually charges.  Overall, not very impressed. I bought a trianium case for my sister's IPhone 6 and that appears to be much slimmer and works just as advertised (case shuts off after the phone is fully charged). This might be my last Alpatronix case if after tonight I still cannot get it to work correctly.  UPDATE: After leaving it plugged in with the cable provided with the case for almost10 hours (left it plugged in since 1:30AM and unplugged around 11AM), the case and phone was finally charged full. I woke up around 8:00AM and saw there were 3 LED lights solid and the last one blinking, but the phone was still not charged. I guess it takes almost 9 hours to charge the case and then the phone will charge after. This should be designed where the phone is charged FIRST, then the case. Secondly, I'm still not seeing the case shut off automatically when it fully charges my phone as advertised. Changing my review from the original 2 stars to 3 stars."
charges but does not keep device charges as you play it. not happy with this purchase.
Would be super awesome if there were a place to store the pencil - or is there?  If so someone let me know.
"[[VIDEOID:57fcb34a130ffb8ba09f6414219adda6]] The Pyle Bluetooth enabled touch screen radio is amazing!<br />It arrived on time and in perfect condition<br /><br />I am often leary about after market radios.<br />Many experience static and just do not sound as good as the factory radio.<br />This was easy to install after we ordered a harness kit for it.<br />My husband installed in his truck, took about 20 minutes tops.<br /><br />As you can see in the video it is so easy to use and has a user friendly interface.<br />The touch screen makes it easy to change channels and drive.<br />It's screen is bright and easy to read.<br />The touch screen responds well to touch, not to testy.<br /><br />Overall a great sounding radio.<br />Easy to use! Has bluetooth too so you can connect music or take calls!<br />I was lucky enough to receive this at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Good product, can easily get smudges but nothing too noticable, plus they give you a nice cleaning cloth to wipe the screen. Have had it for over a year now and its still in good condition."
The reason why I love this case is because it clear and let me tell you I've dropped this many times and so far u have no scratches or cracks. Also the price is crazy it's so CHEAP and I'm 100% satisfied!
"This are really nice earbuds. I listen to books on tape all day long. I'd rather sit and read but unfortunately my life doesn't allow that kind of commitment. Audio books are the next best thing. The problem with audio books is that you don't necessarily want to share ALL your books with your kids so you need earphones. My &#34;go to&#34; headset has been a behind/over the ears bluetooth style that are extremely comfortable because they aren't earbuds. But they are also big and bulky so it was nice to be able to try something a little different.<br /><br />The earbuds come with 3 different ear pieces and 4 different wings. That gives you a really nice variety of configurations to make them comfortable. I've worn them out and about and during farm chores, they've stayed in and been very comfortable. I'm on day 2 and I've not had to charge them again so I can say the battery life is really good too.  The buttons are easy to access, I did have difficulty at first manipulating the central button but now it's second nature.<br /><br />I do wish the range was a bit better on these. Normally I can leave the phone in a central location in the room and I can get a decent distance before it starts to cut out. With these earbuds normally I have to stay within eyesight of the phone and sometimes just having it in my back pocket was enough to make it cut out.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion."
Very good product. I recharged my Samsung phone 3 times. Still the 4 led are on. This is the best product I bought on amazon.
This set cam with everything as promised. Warning...the screws inside your phone are size of ants! Be very careful not to loose any.
"I've been buying flex tubing for years, and most of the time the measurement is ID not OD. This tubing is 3/8&#34; ID, 1/2&#34; OD and should be advertised as such."
you cant go.very far from your phone before the reception is affected. by very far i mean 3 ft.  and the sound quality varies from call to call..i work from home and  i have alot of conference calls for work and there is a bit of white noise on calls.
Excellent  I love how looks on my phone. .
"Great product.  I have used it in all conditions on the road.  So far, my phone is still secure on the bike.  The phone can breathe very well in the case.  However, this is not water proof. The plastic screen on the case is touchable which means you can use the phone without taking it out."
Got product great price got 3 screan protectors mirrored love em
I was happy with my product. It was exactly what I ordered.  The screen cover came with exact directions on how to put it on.
Great product that installed easily and looks great. Very happy with my purchase.
"this speaker is simply awesome - I'm amazed by how much sound, especially bass, it can produce.  And the battery lasts forever!!  15 hours playback time.  I also like that you can personalize the voices - the gangster one rocks.<br /><br />I do suggest that you do NOT go on their website for any help.  The installation instructions are flat out wrong, as the guy on the 1-800 number told me.  If you need to install the Jawbone updater (which you should for firmware updates), just call them and they'll walk you through it"
"I already purchase the Nozza for my iphones 5/6, but this one is for the Galaxy S6. I purchased this as a gift for my friend who recently got a new S6. Packaging was easy to maneuver around and easy to open. The screen protector wasn't broken when we received it, so that's a plus. It comes with the alchy wet and dry wipes (with numbers labeled) so you know what order to use them in. Also, there's tape for either side of the screen protector for you to apply it onto the phone so you don't get fingerprint smears on them. There's also a sticker that you can use to remove any dust that's on your phone screen.<br /><br />Super easy to apply on and fits the phone perfect. It's ends right before the edges so an otterbox case fits it perfectly and doesn't lift up the edges. The cutouts are good too and doesn't cover the camera and fits just right around the home button. It's thick, but transparent and does a great job at protecting the screen. It's worth the price and I hadn't had trouble with this screen protector or the ones for on my iphone!<br /><br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for providing an unbiased review."
"Great experience but my only complaint is that the Samsung Galaxy Blaze Flex Protective Cover doesn't allow for access to the phones SIM card slot.  There is literally NO OPEN/ACCESS SLOT!  For the price 'll just live with it, or maybe even modify it at a later time..."
It did not fit my phone and it does not look like the picture
"I used this on an iPhone 6, and it worked great. I was using it on a corroded phone, so I managed to strip one screw, but I think that was unavoidable. Here's the bonus: I jammed the plastic tray into a truly overstuffed suitcase and it came out looking just like it did when it went in. I am amazed."
"Great sound quality, great bass,but mic is a little low,had to speak louder and another thing I noticed battery life was a little short on stanby"
"Works great. Have a 1992 Toyota tercel. Hooked this up about two years ago and is still working great. The only problem I have is that the light blinking feature stopped working, I replaced the module, then the new module the lock feature stopped working, so I threw back in the old module and rewired the light blink to the lock trigger wire and the lights blink now when I lock the vehicle. I also threw in a relay that makes the lights blink and the horn sound when locking. Can't beat the price, fairly simple to set up and works for me."
As described Had it for a few days fits perfect touch screen works as if it belong to phone very happy thanks
PERFECT and so easy to use. follow instructions and use the handy alcohol wipes they have enclosed. Worth every penny.
"It's a great charging case. It's really light weight and slim which is great! But, the thing that drives me crazy most of the time is taking the case apart. It's hard to take the front part off to put ur phone in. I feel like everytime I take it off it feels like the front part would snap and break. So you gotta be gentle with taking it apart to charge ur phone."
"This case looks really nice, the wood grain is beautiful and the plastic sides have a matte finish so it doesn't look cheap. My only complaint on the looks is that my cover had a bit of the glue they used to secure the wood piece to the plastic coming out the side and it is hard to scrape off, but unless you are looking closely you don't notice it. Overall it's a nice case and fits well, it just doesn't offer a ton of protection, it's mostly for looks but I figured that would be the case when I ordered it so I'm not disappointed.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  Update: after about a week on my phone it is already showing a lot of wear without any hard use. It scratches on the back very easily and has a chip out of the front of the case. Very disappointed in the quality once I started using it."
This is so fun to use to get the macro shots. It is sometimes difficult though to get the image focused even though I am 1-2 inches away (which is also a little too close to get to something).
"Super disappointed in the product! I'll be exchanging or returning it. I spent a lot of time researching selfie sticks for our upcoming honeymoon & within 2 uses the charger cord fell apart. I was just pulling it out of the stick & heard a snap & now the charger just falls out of the slot & doesnt charge. I wasn't forcefully pulling it out either. The other complaint is how often you have to repair it. I would take a pic & then 2 minutes later try to take another & I'd have to hold the power button for a full 30 sec to get it to come back on & pair up. This happened every time! I feel like I shouldn't have to do that every other minute, but maybe that's standard with selfie sticks? I love everything else about the actual design of it."
"A little flimsy but does the job.  Using on my road bike while on the trainer.  It's better than setting the iPad on the make shift shelf I created to hold the iPad while using trainerroad. Update I have had two of pieces break while using the holder.  Maybe I used to much strength but when I first try to make it tight enough to not move on my road bike handle bars I pulled the strap too hard and it broke,  Recently I was just trying to get it off my bike and it would release so I pushed the release button a little more and then it broke."
"I've only had the case for 24h.<br />So far it is promising but has 2 limitations.<br />#1, as noted in other reviews, there is not a great deal of screen protection and I am concerned about that. My husband bought a Mophie yesterday and that has much greater protection but at more than 10x the price of this case.<br />#2 I can't charge the case via my cars USB port (Prius V 2012) because it pulls too much power according to the car. My son's phone also uses a micro usb and he has the same problem.<br />The charger is a standard micro usb and I was able to use my existing micro charger to charge the phone and case overnight.<br /><br />I like the weight and feel of the charger in my hand.<br /><br />A great value over all."
These cables look pretty sturdy. Hope they work for a very long time. I wish they were a little longer though. But the price is great!!! And the email follow up is very cool and professional.
"I was looking to switch up my phone cases and this case caught my eye.  When it arrived I was happy to see how flexible the material was.  It was very easy to get my phone in the case and I had no struggle getting it out again.  I like the bright pink color and how the material is transparent in the back so the apple logo shows through.  The cut outs are in the exact right places and I have had no problem using my camera or plug ins.  There is a small raised edge around the front of the phone, and thicker bumpers on the back, so it provides some protection without being bulky.<br />  I did notice that my fingerprints show up pretty easily on the back of the case and it already has a very small scratch, but it isn't very noticeable.<br />  Overall, I think this is an attractive, affordable case.<br />  I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
+<br />+Not as vibrant as pictured but still brightly colored (camouflage/real tree)<br />+Fits phone perfectly<br />+Easy to put on<br />+Feels good in my hand<br /><br />-<br />-Started to get scratched off a little after a couple of months<br />-The rubber part at the bottom gets stretched out and caught under the plastic<br />-Too thick at the top for headphones that have a horizontal plug; it'll keep popping out<br />-Pulling down anything from the top of your screen requires a stubby thumb or using the side of your thumb because case comes down so low onto the screen...not thumb nail friendly
"very easy to use and high quality, packaging is very basic though and one of my rubbers had a lil dig on it"
this is a .99 cent cheap cheap get it at a flee market case.
"I've been using this case for my iphone for almost two years now, and it's still going strong. There are no rigid corners that crack over time, and it has successfully protected my phone from a few drops. It looks good, even though there is now a lot of scuffing on the back."
Good case durable and like the color just a little tough to get into holder but other then that very good
Works well for a few months but then the left ear channel stops producing sound.  I bought two of these and the same thing occurred.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Not worth it if you are looking for a long term investment.
"Just got my case yesterday and I love it.  Now I don't feel like my phone is gonna slip out of my hand.  The sliding door for the cards is a little hard to open, but I guess that's better than my cards falling out.  And I've already dropped my phone once (yes, I do that quite often) and it kept it nice and safe."
"Felt flimsier/cheaper than my store bought Otterbox, which says &#34;Made In USA&#34; and was bought at the Verizon store, this one says &#34;Made in China&#34;. Still covered the phone and works as expected though and would purchase again."
I bought this case for my boyfriend and he loves it. He needed a rugged case and this does the trick. It's made of a very nice quality material. I would definitely buy again.
"Good product and good quality,, fits perfectly in the cd slot and holds well. And very compact.<br />The cd slot is at a perfect place in my car, so reaching the phone is easy."
Love the phone. Upgraded from a Galaxy S3 with Cyanogenmod ROM. Battery life is much better. Camera is wonderful with a nice f1.8 lens. Battery is removable and you can add storage with a micro SD card.
Perfect case for iPhone6plus!  It doesn't hide the back of your iphone and it looks like there is no case because its clear and light. I am happy customer!
"It was a great case at first but it stop functioning. Perhaps a malfunction because I have purchased this brand before. Anyways, refund was without hassle. Good service"
"While bulky, it's tremendously protective and I can use all the buttons and inputs easily. Headphone input is for slim headphones. I adapt when necessary which is fine by me. Love it."
"I purchased this package primarily for the case and I'm quite pleased with it.  It reminds me of the Spigen cases I often see on iPhones.  It's very minimalist while still providing solid protection on the back and corners.  The case itself doesn't add much bulk to the device and I feel like it's a good balance between protection and maintaining the slim dimensions of the Walkman.<br /><br />The case is made of a fairly stiff material that allows it to slip easily into a pocket.  The material isn't 'sticky' or 'stretchy' like some of the silicone cases.  I purchased the clear case and I hope it will not yellow over time.  I don't use the belt clip or holster so this was a chief concern for me when shopping for the product.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented about the 'bump' on the back of the case meant for the belt clip.  It doesn't bother me in the least.  It looks more prominent in the pictures than it actually is.  It's nice to have the flexibility to use the holster if I wanted though I should note that the holster itself seems *very* cheap and I doubt how long it would last before breaking.  In fact I'm not sure I would trust the holster to retain the device.  I'm okay with this because, as I mentioned earlier, I purchased this package for the case.  I already have an armband to use for exercise.<br /><br />I'm not real impressed with the screen protector.  It's a good thickness, but I feel like it's sized too small for the device.  Overall, I think this package is a good purchase and would recommend it."
"In a while word, Simple. Very straightforward to install and use. I have tried others but this one works best. I have a large phablet (Nexus 6), and most of the others I've tried can't hold it security. With the two options of magnetic backs this one worked well. I utilised larger of the two for my phone, and placed the smaller one on my wife's S5. Both held well.<br /><br />Installation was a snap in the car. My wife has a Mini Cooper with round vents. This units universal clips made securing it to the car a breeze. Unlike others, it's as easy to remove as it is to install. If you travel & are looking for a unit you can put in a rental car, this is the one. The solid construction with no flimsy parts to snap off makes it ideal to just toss into your bag and use in whatever car you are driving in. This is very handy if your in an unfamiliar city & use your phone for directions."
it is impossible to charge at the same time. waste of money. i tried 6 difference charging cables with usb
Yooo<br />Some nice ass decals<br />Great shipping<br />Got a consumer for life<br />Highly recommended!!!!
Will the Zera Navigation system RZ8420KK operate SiriusXM?
This broke within a month.  Garbage.
Forgot how long the battery on my Note 4 was supposed to last before I put this in. Even with heavy use my phone easily lasts all day again .
"Charges iPad Air 2 at 1AMP but that is to be expected without Power IQ.   Anker Direct reached out to me in less than 24 hours to clarify and help me out with a 10W iPad ready charger instead. I declined since I already have 3 OEM Apple 12 and 14W chargers.   The main reason I bought this charger was to recharge my new Anker PowerCore+ 10050 power bank with QC2.0 speeds. I can tell you that it definitely works for that. I ran the PowerCore+ down and recharged it to full in less than 3 hours!  Now that's fast!  It got warm but never hot.   If you have a QC2.0 compatible device, this is the charger for you."
"I love the power bank, great capacity. I lost my the instruction manual that came with the bank, can anyone help me out with a copy or instructions in regards to charging the bank please? Thanks"
Does what it says. Nice display.
these usb cables work pretty well. one of them seems like it developed a short in the cable or something.
"Good protection, colors are bright (easy to find in my mess of a purse).  I had a little trouble at first with the volume buttons but I figured out that it wasn't snapped completely tight so use firm pressure all the way around to make sure it's all snapped together.  It seems a little bulky, but then I was using a slim Speck cover prior to this, but I'm getting used to it."
I just bought 4 tiles and am very disappointed.  The sound is inaudible in my purse so almost useless.  I can hear the tile on my keys only when standing next to them.  According to the video advertising the sound is loud and distinctive but not true at all! ! I was planning to give some to friends but I really can't promote this product.
"I have owned several smartphone mount cradles in the past. I have had some successes and failures. I was excited to put the Aukey Universal Smartphone windshield to test. I tested it in our minivan and station wagon. The experience is great in both. It is sturdy. It sticks to the windshield stronger than I expected.  What do I like about it? First and foremost, it is versatile. It requires a little assembly. Following the assembly, you can fit your phone and even your GPS in there. I used an iPhone, iPod, Samsung Galaxy S6, and two different Garmin GPS. Also, it is secure. You simply pull down the locking lever to secure the mount. It has an extra strong-cup with sticky gel. It has resisted the summer months so far. The gel has not lost its stickiness. The suction cup adheres securely to the windshield. Since I have had the holder set up, I have not had any issues with it. I have even changed devices in the holder. All the devices remained attached firmly.  Also, it is padded to protect your phone from scratches. This is also another feature that set this cradle apart from the others. Lastly, it has a Full 360-Degree rotation for the perfect viewing angle.  What don't I like about it? I cannot think of anything besides it takes a great effort to remove it from the windshield.  I would strongly recommend this product.  [A Review Sample Was Provided For Evaluation and Review]"
"This is the best case I've tried. Very grippy with the side ribs, and especially with the extended corners - which, by the way provide great protection for drops (from experience). It is slim indeed, not slippery like many other cases I've tried including a Spigen protective case.<br />I would give it 4.5 stars if I could - the drawback for me is it's semi-transparent. My phone is work-issued with a bar code strip they place on the back, so it shows through. I wish they made this in an opaque version but I haven't seen it. The color is sort of a root beer brown, which looks quite nice. Highly recommended overall."
"I have had this for about a week now, and it functions perfectly.  I carry these in my backpack always and on flights when it's difficult to get to charging hubs in the airport.  This one completely charged a iPad mini from 2%, a full size iPad from 50% and charged my iPhone twice and it still had some juice left in it.  It is a little larger than the other charger I have but not a problem and it's certainly worth it. This will be my new daily carry.  It comes with a charging cable for itself and a carry bag.  It has a 4 light indicator that lets you know how much juice it has left and there are two ports to allow for charging two items at once.  Great item!"
I really like this case because it was my second one. The only problem is the id pouch will come off after much use.
"My phone  had a protective  cover the didn't fit, had to remove  the cover and was now o"
"great sound,but,the manual and the prompts are in chinese,can't figure out how to change to englich,i may have to return them"
"The bottom part of the design is lopsided/slanted, it doesn't bother me all that much I still do wish it was straight. I really do like this case, I get compliments on it, and it fits great on my phone."
I really like this cover and I got one for my Samsung phone. The problem with this one is it causes a shadow from the flash with the Sony xperia Z3.
If Scotty Kilmer likes something it must be good.
"I have bought and/or reviewed many, many &#34;power bank&#34; devices. Most are pretty basic, but some have the extra touches that stand out from the crowd. The OLALA models, of which I've tested several, are uniformly above average and the new C2-i reviewed here is no exception. OLALA sent me a C2-i at no charge and asked for a review.<br /><br />Appearance-wise, the C2-i has a shape that resembles an iPhone, with a width and length just a bit smaller than the iPhone 6. The front and back of the case are white and the accent strip around the edge is gold. The C2i can charge two devices. A built-in Apple Lightning connector on a short cord tucks into the case and can be easily pulled out when needed. The placement of this makes it easy to just put the charger back to back with your phone. There is also a regular USB jack for other devices. The integrated Lightning cord is good for 2A, while the USB port is good for 2.4A. I charged an iPhone 6 and an Android phone at the same time. The total output appears to be 2.4A across two devices, however.<br /><br />There is a power button on the side which you must press to activate power to the devices. I found that if enough time had passed since I plugged one device in, I needed to press it again to activate power to a second device. A series of four LEDs indicates battery status when you charge the power bank (a short USB to MicroUSB cable is provided for this) or during use when you press the button.<br /><br />I tested the output using a Legion Meter and it delivered close to 2A when charging the Android phone. (I can't test the Lightning output but it charged the phone at a normal rate for a high-power charger.)<br /><br />I have a larger and heavier, 1000mAh charger but this OLALA may become my travel favorite."
"Not able to use all lightening chargers, case restricts plug from inserting into charging interface.  My 11 year old ended up ditching it after 2-3 weeks."
"Not bad, thick cable but the end housing and cable housing separated a couple week after purchase. It still functions, but I wish it would stay together"
"Overall I like the Nubia Z9. Sure, it’s thicker and heavier than other flagship smartphones, but not so much that I couldn’t get used to it. It is solid and has a quality feel to it. The display and the camera are both impressive and the few things I could actually do with the device make it seem like the performance would be pretty awesome if it were running a US version of Android with all of the expected Google integrations.<br /><br />The Nubia Z9 is expected to be available in the United States soon. The Nubia Z9 Classis will cost $564, and then the price goes up for the Elite ($645) and Exclusive ($725) models. Those are definitely flagship smartphone prices and put the Nubia Z9 head-to-head with Samsung and Apple—a tough market to play in.<br /><br />Take a look at the complete review on TechSpective.net: http://techspective.net/2015/08/29/review-zte-nubia-z9-smartphone/"
"I bought the white slim armor, and it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I have neuropathy in my fingers, so I drop things a lot, including this phone. I used this case for the phone and a sheet of tempered glass for the screen, and it doesn't have a scratch. Amazing protection. It has the added benefit of looking cool as all get out when I take it out to take a photo. I always get questions and compliments on it. And with the white version of the phone, it just looks incredibly professional. I just wish I'd known about these when I was using a Note 2."
Great for what is is. Nicer materials used then many adapters. Only thing I would ask is for suggestions for securing the sim card to hold it in place within the adapter when trying to insert it in the phone.
"Shell fits well on moto X2. Has excellent features as, flushed - Volume and raised on/off button making it easy to locate. Belt holder is made small it was impossible to slide the shell in and out. If you don't plan to use the belt holder it's fine. I also happen to order a iBalson set for my Moto X2. What a great surprise! The Celljoy protective shell fits perfectly into the iBalson holder. It slide perfectly in and out as made for the other. It might cost a few extra change but it's worth it."
"really good screen protector for my ipad, I got it for really good price and until now it works good protecting my iPad from scratches!!!"
Well I'll just start by saying that the product is cheap made and a soon as I put it on my phone it broke so I won't buy this product again. And 2 stars are more than enough trust me
I like this a lot. It has a nice size screen and it takes great pictures. Unfortunately it is not Sprint compatible so I am unable to activate it with my current contracted plan. It does have a lot of storage and comes pre-loaded with some apps (some that can't be removed just like any other smartphone does--why do they do that anyway?) It's a nice phone and a decent price.
Reasonable priced perfect solution for the job
"Works great with Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. I use the cord that came with the cell to power the charger, so it charges cell in almost the same amount of time."
"At first, this was a pain in the neck trying to find out how to apply this, because it came with no instructions. Even though it looks like one piece of plastic, it actually has a piece to peel off. smh One thing I could say it that it hasn't scratch since I bought it about 2 months now. It does get fingerprints on it, but I wipe it with a microfiber cloth, & it looks just as new."
"Great Speed and Cadence sensors. Firstly these are ANT+ so you either need a Ant+ Receiving device like a Garmin Watch (only some models work with separate speed and cadence monitors)  or an ANT+ ready phone with an App that can see separate Speed and Cadence devices. I have a  Samsung Galaxy S4 phone with Android 5.0.1 Lollipop installed.  My phone is ANT+ ready and I've updated the ANT+ radio services and Ant+ plugin service at the Google Play store. After that I had to find an App that worked best with these devices. I tried IPBike which works great but is a little confusing. I then tried the Wahoo App which is going to be my go to app. All my Ant+ devices connected perfectly using the Wahoo app. I have my Garmin Ant+ heart rate monitor, my garmin Ant+ food pod, and both the garmin ant+ cadence and speed sensors that I am writing this review about. The Wahoo app layout is very easy to read and the best part is I can choose weather I want gps to display my speed when outdoors or I can chose to use the speed sensor. Most apps if you are outside using gps automatically use gps for speed even if you have the speed sensor. Finally the Wahoo app will upload my data to Strava<br /><br />Strava is in the works to develop their app to work with Ant+ devices but that are dragging their feet. There may be other apps that work with this set up but as of now I'm very happy with Wahoo app supporting these Ant+ speed and cadence sensors.<br /><br />I have a very small issue and its not with this product, my bike rear hub is thicker on one side than the other. It puts the speed sensor on a slight angle but I don't think is having any effect. I can put the speed sensor on the front hub with is skinny and the same thickness across, but indoor training I need to put it on the back wheel.ng I need to put it on the back wheel."
"This does not work on a Samsung S5 with a case. I have a new S5 with a thin leather wrap around case. Its the type that folds back to use it and then folds over the front and has a small magnetic strap that keeps it closed, excellent case. This holder is not deep enough on the side mounts to grab the case and the phone, it only grabs the case. The phone falls out and is only hung on by the case.<br />The case only adds about 3/8&#34; to the total depth."
Works just fine with my Note Edge.
"It lasted about 20 days before the phone holder ripped away from the armband.  The picture shows a wider tab holding the phone on the armband than the one I received.  I think the wider tab would prevent ripping.  Otherwise, it is very comfortable and doesn't fog over with sweat on the inside."
It  works great..but it looked silver online and is clear plastic but has a nice design.
$25 for two batt.  What a deal...love Anker...buy their product for everything electronic
"This is junk. I've owned my jawbone for 9 weeks, and I've experienced numerous problems with syncing, power, and overall use. I've been on the phone with customer support countless times in order to find a solution. This thing is more trouble than it's worth and good luck getting jawbone to honor their warranty by sending a replacement.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly regret this purchase."
Perfect to replace single car charger
"Powermat needs to change this design. I have an iPhone 4S with a Powermat case and it works well to this day - of which, one of the undeniable features is that the case itself is rugged and solid. You can toss it, let it fall and your phone is safe and it doesn't affect the charging ability of the case. SO when I got my iPhone 5S, I bought the Powermat case, because I already have the mat. Although I noticed that the 5 design was totally different, I had faith in my previous experience. However, the case if cumbersome (very sharp edges) unlike it predecessor. Also, after it took one fall (ONE FALL!!) it stopped charging via the mat. So ok, I started using the cable to charge it - HOWEVER for you to use the cable, you need to remove the bottom piece/attached (EVERYTIME YOU CHARGE!) and then replace it. The previous case DID NOT have this issue. So after a couple weeks of doing this, the bottom piece snaps into 2 pieces in my hand!! End of case."
"I thought the replacement didn't work until I read the Samsung Galaxy S5 can require an extra good push of the plug into the jack until it is fully inserted, which it did and worked. I realized there was still debris in the bottom of the original and after more cleaning it feels snug with a good push, maybe not needing replacement after all!"
"The case fit perfectly, came promptly, and I am very pleased with it."
"Great case for the price, it's a slim fit that doesn't make the phone too bulky"
"This thing is amazing. I am buying another as a back-up. I would still buy it if it was 3x the price. The ability to very discreetly listen to music while living in NYC is absolutely amazing, and the bystander thinks it's a hearing aid, with which I am fine. Truth, I have not used the phone function yet, but, for background discreet music alone, it is worth the price."
"This phone mirrors W8 that I use(d - now on W10) so it was easy for me to understand. I really don't have anything bad to say about the phone but I am a little disappointed that it only has one camera - no forward facing camera - I'm not big into selfies anyway! But performance is everything expected and battery life is great - I can go 2 or 3 days without having to charge, but I'm not a heavy user. If you want a cheap, easy to use Windows phone and are not into 'selfies' then this could work for you."
It's a pretty neat charger which I got for a pretty good deal. Hopefully it will last for a long time
Good headphones however we go through multiple pairs a month as they don't last when you start to sweat. The headphone part works but the microphone the person on the other end cannot hear you.
Nice thicker plastic! Hugs the phone on all edges and offers a bit of support and protection!
"No issues with product compatibility or anything, super sturdy and works great"
"These are great-performance portable and cheap walkie-talkies! We use them when travelling together with a couple of cars, camping, when skiing and hiking!<br /><br />Pros: Great battery life (20-30h with good AAA batteries), very very durable (survive multiple rains / snowfalls being outside of my jacket, so we can talk. Multiple drops in the snow).<br />Cons: None really! Except the included rechargeable batteries - they are worthless (last for 3-4 hours) - get some 900mAh Eneloops to last ~2 full days with average talking.<br /><br />Performance (Range): Don't get confused by the small size - those radios perform just like any other FRS/GMRS radios that would promise 5W power with big antennas and stuff - it's all the standard (i.e. frequencies) they are on:<br />- In clear line of sight - they can really do maybe 10 miles - never tried it really, but friends have used them for paragliding and they said they work;<br />- Mountains (hiking/skiing) - 500m-2km (depends on the thickness of the forest and other obstacles) and you HAVE to be on the same side of the hill - it is not possible to reach anyone on the other side of a hill - the radio waves can't go through.<br />- City (250m) /Indoors in a building (100m) - depends again on the obstacles, but the signal won't go through many walls. Absolutely no problem in a several buildings venues - like ski resorts, all-inclusive hotels, big ships, etc.<br /><br />They are practically eternal, the only reason we buy new ones is that friends/kids easily lose them. Me and friends are using more than 15 pairs (!) of those - none ever broke! Excellent quality!<br /><br />Tip: Get couple of those conference badge straps and buckle them up at the back of the radio, so you can easily carry them around on your neck - you will never lose them, you will always hear them and be able to answer quickly - very useful when skiing for example - you can talk with your gloves on from the chair lift, without being afraid that you might drop them - and actually that's the time we usually chat &#34;who's where in the valley&#34;.<br /><br />Bottom line: Those radios are great for friends & family - they do a great job, smallest, cheapest and toughest on the market! You can easily convince your friends to get a pair :) If those would be your first radios, buy them without hesitation! You don't need the security features other offer, no one really uses those and they would also decrease the range! If you need higher power and higher penetration in a city environment - go get a VHF/UHF radio like Baofeng 5 series, but it is a completely different story & price (as well as complexity to config & operate). These Unidens are even wife/grandma user friendly :)"
"Screen protector is of reasonable quality. However, directions for its use lacked clarity. I also experienced some difficulty aligning the protector onto the screen."
Another quality Anker product. I've used their stuff for a couple years and it is well-made and works great.
"Love Spigen slim armor series, Had it for my LGG3 and protected it from all, even has enough lip to protect screen, same with this one. Perect"
"So far I am very impressed with the quality, features and workmanship of this item. It's worth the investment. I should have just got this before I got the other two cheaper models.<br />At time of review, I have had this item for 1 day."
"I bought this cable recently as a gift. It was installed and used regularly but gently in one location. Within a couple of months, the cable started failing. Although the product advertises a 1 year warranty, the vendor will not honor that warranty. I contacted the vendor, whose website indicates they're in &#34;Ontario, CA, USA&#34;, but by their broken English, they're clearly in China.<br /><br />The indicated a replacement was not available because the product is &#34;out of stock&#34;, even though it's the newest item on their product website. They first offerred me an alternative - an iPhone/iPad docking station with a 30-pin connector (a laughably dated and useless substitute). I refused and asked them if I could wait for it to become in stock. Again they refused with &#34;Sorry for our this item was out of stock and will not produce it since the order qtys, but we have a lightning cable can work your phone as attached for study, hope it is ok for you.&#34; The replacement they're offering is a simple lightning cable (retail value substantially less than the Visible Green).<br /><br />The cable is a fun gimmick, but if you want a reliable charging solution or anything more than a fun time for a few charges, stay far away from Dexim."
It does the job. I was hoping for more up time but for the price I think it is a very good deal.
bought two and after less than a week one blew and item isnt eligible for return. Wouldn't recommend for purchase not worth the price.
Great quality for the price. Very easy to install.
Bought this to replace battery that would not hold charge anymore. It fits radio as it is suppose to.
"Super cute! It did take a little while to get here, but so worth the wait! I've dropped my phone a few times and it just bounced - super protective!"
"has a thin green line that runs from the top to the bottom in the very center.... but I really don't have time to send it back.... kind of upset about it, but it is mounted and it gets a great picture other than that from the blue ray in the 15 passenger van..... it is only one of 5 monitors the van has.... so if the kids want to they can watch the other monitors if they want to be picky....still blows about spending the money and mounting it....then finding out it had the green line....problem is when you purchase things that are not prime...people expect you to pay to ship things back to them... when it is their product that is bad.......I just don't have time for it....it does ok as it is otherwise."
"Well, it is a fun to use this small device. It works perfectly fine with any devices having a 3.5 mm Audio output. I have tested it with my Desktop, Laptop, Android Phones and IPod Classic and every time, it worked perfectly. It is better to read the setup document or manual which comes with it, especially if you want to pair two different speakers with it. Once configured, both the speakers will work without any loss of Audio quality. I have tested it with my Jabra Solemate and EC Technology 6W BT speaker. There are some occasional sound drop and the range performance isn't great while controlling two speakers."
"It's black, it comes in a black velvet bag with a USB-Mini-USB connector. It's charges the iOS devices I use multiple times. Did I say it came in a black velvet back?? A heavier material for the bag would have ben better."
Works great!! Make sure it's closed all the way and it works perfect... my one complaint is that my microphone is blocked when I use this case so talking one my phone was annoying constantly yelling to whoever I'm talking to.. or having to take the case off for every call
"I was expecting this phone to not be anything fancy like those high-end phones. But I am very satisfied with this phone. The only con I would say this phone has, is low quality resolution in taking pictures."
It was a really good value and a very good product
Reasonable priced perfect solution for the job
It's a good tough case. My only complaint is the design on the back of the case fades a lot after going in and out of my pocket all the time. But it's to be expected from a knock off brand. Besides that it protects the phone really well.
"These cases are great.  I bought it again for my new phone because my last one held up so well. My phone has been beaten up by my small children and never a scratch with this case. Thrown down stairs, out of the car while parked ;) and dropped hundreds of times. I'll never use a different case."
The quality is somewhat poor. The inner soft/silicon layer is too bad. Significant portions (specially top and bottom sides) of this layer/material are exposed to dust/dirt. It attracts and holds all sorts of dirt and dust particles. This causes the phone (screen and all other sides) to be full of dust all the time. The dust particles cannot be removed easily. So the dust layer increases cumulatively. This soft layer may not also last long. This case may provide more protection on the back than on the front/screen side. Only good thing about the case is that it fits the phone well.
As soon as you get up to highway speed the corner start to fold in on it self so you can't see the screen anymore.
"The picture doesn´t match the item they shipped.<br />The aluminum Skoda badges aren´t exactly the same but they are well made (Just like the originals), so I had to take off the logos from the cheap caps they shipped (They don´t fit tight on the wheels). Finally I paste them back with super industrial glue on the original caps. They now look just the same on the wheels."
"This is a great little bluetooth keyboard. I use it with my apple tv so the backlighting is great for a darker room. I mistakenly thought it would be able to pair with multiple devices so that I could also use it with my tablet and phone, but it will only pair with one device.<br />If your looking for a small keyboard that has long battery life and also lights up for dark spaces, this is it. The cool thing is that you can pick from several different colors."
"Life saver! Such a great value, works great, and no issues."
"This charger worked good charging my phone while I was in Europe, but some reason, it did not want to charge my tablet.  I thought the problem was the tablet, and it could be, because once I returned to the US the charging problems disappeared.  Take this review with a grain or two of salt as the problem my have been the tablet."
Works great on tablet...pen does not write well but might be due to ink needing to settle down to the point. Nice stylus that can be clipp3d to shirt pocket. I like that.
"The selling point for this power bank is its portability; it can easily be kept in your pocket, purse or backpack to be carried with you: 5.5 inches long, 2.75 inches wide, about 1/4 of an inch thick, and it weighs in at about 5.3 ounces per our postal scale.<br /><br />Operating this battery is a breeze -- just charge it up and then connect it to your device with the built-in, very short micro-USB cable.<br /><br />This unit is priced at the top of the range for a power bank with 3200mAh capacity, especially since it's output flow is under 2A (1.6A rated), and it can only be used to charge devices that use a micro-USB connection. Would recommended it if you are looking for a portable power bank like this, just to have in case of an emergency.<br /><br />Extremely portable; if you are looking for a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then give this thin micro-USB power bank a try.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
"I'm very pleased with how well this case protects my iPod, all the buttons work.  The clip is not great, kind of loose.  After using it for awhile I've figured out what I can and can't do with the clip.  I would order it again."
Case does not fit securely around the phone.  I don't believe this product will protect the phone as well as it claims.  I'll be looking for another product.
I bought two watches and one of them surprisingly was not fixed to its band.<br />screan has low resolution and not response easley to my touch.
"the cable is super stiff, no flex.  The male tab end broke/snapped after just 1 month of light use."
"The Baofeng UV-82 is a substantial improvement over the earlier UV-5R series of radios.  The UV-82 includes new electronics and software, is more ergonomic, and offers improved performace - especially in the receiver.  There are limitations - a slow scan rate, a modest number of memory channels (128), and limited selectivity are examples - but for the price, this is an excellent radio.  Reception is clear (assuming reasonable conditions and signal quality) and transmit audio is also clear.  The speaker, which was a weak point in previous Baofeng designs, now delivers clear audio with plenty of volume.  The radio produces rated power easily and the battery life is OK, though not exceptional.<br /><br />The UV-82C is US FCC Part 90 certified so it is legal for use in commercial and public safety applications in the US.  (Note that it's only legal to transmit on frequencies for which you or your organization hold a valid FCC license.)  The UV-82C does require a computer, programming cable and free software for initial setup, but that's a minor inconvenience when compared to the cost and setup hassle associated with other Part 90-certified radios.  Programming via computer is relatively simple and painless if you're reasonably familiar with computers and radio programming but it is a required part of setting up the radio initially. If you're expecting a radio that's as easy to use out of the box as a CB or FRS radio, this isn't the radio for you.<br /><br />Please note: this radio is designed for commercial applications.  With the VFO mode enabled (which requires a computer, cable and software as noted above) it performs fairly well as an amateur(&#34;ham&#34;) transceiver.  Switching between memory mode and VFO mode does require switching the radio off and then back on, however, so it's nowhere near as convenient as on radios designed specifically for amateur use.<br /><br />This radio is NOT designed for use as a scanning receiver (&#34;police scanner&#34;).  It doesoffer basic scanning capability but anyone who wants a radio for listening to their local public safety agencies would be much better served by a scanner designed for that purpose.  In fact, in many areas, unless you're specifically authorized by the agencies whose frequencies you have programmed, having a radio that's capable of transmitting programmed with police or public safety frequencies is illegal."
I love my Speck case. I purchased this one to replace my previous one that was damaged after dropping my phone multiple times. I want the protection of a case without my phone felling like it has a case on it. Speck fits that description wonderfully.<br /><br />The back and front are usually sold separately so this was a super price for the set.
"I love it fits the s3 perfect the screen is super simple to put on and looks great, it's essentially an otterbox but a fraction of the cost"
"Great case, nicely fits two cards. Not too heavy but appears to be sturdy and well-protected. Thought the access to the cards was initially difficult but after a few times it slides well and is easy to manage. Love it!"
DO NOT BUY. THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST SPEAKERS. my kappa's that were half the price and can get the older models for like$60 and those were better than these! I didnt think it was possible for 200 dollar speakers to sound so bad. My friends Sony explodes sound better than these!!! Do yrself a favor and get the kicker ks speakers. The components are $150. They sound great
"I don't get all the 5 star reviews -- they have to be bogus -- This case is a piece of junk.  Kickstand is so cheap, it almost broke while installing phone, it is held in by 2 little plastic tabs (they are the width of a needle) -- pic added.  Case itself is very flimsy plastic, the &#34;rubberized TPU&#34; is actually plastic, not at all like rubber, no grip. -- the &#34;ARMOR&#34; in its name is a joke.  Other brand cases I have have had a real rubber feel.  Most (not all) plugs won't fit in to charge it, they are a little too fat for the opening, it has to be a slim plug not the square ended ones.  It also is not like a typical case in which you fit the rubber case on followed by slipping it into the plastic, this one the phone just slips into the whole thing.  As far as durability from dropping it I would not risk it.  My last case for my M8 was an IBlasen for like 3$ more, I'm ordering it for this and returning this junk.  It just was not avail for next day (sat) delivery.  Don't be fooled by the nice looks of this, it's going back"
"I had used this charger for a week. Then, while driving I smelt a burning smell and noticed that it was no longer working."
"Nice case, perfect fit, good quality. Work as expected: audio/charging port, volume/power buttons."
"Dropped my Edge this morning down some steps, and even though they weren't hard hits, my screen is completely shattered. I put this screen protector on as soon as I took my phone out of the box. Not sure if it's because tempered glass literally fuses with the phone's glass or what. But the the whole purpose of buying a screen protector is for protection. Might as well not have even had this screen protector on my phone!! My screen was damaged and doesn't work anymore, so now i'm getting a new phone. Not happy."
"Hard to apply and does not stay in place. Get the Galaxy S6 Edge Screen Protector by JETech from amFilm, it's made with tempered glass and takes less thgan a minute to install with NO Drama."
it did not work on her phone at all and it was an unreturnable product which amazon ended up refunding my money.
It's very nice watch  band. Fits excellent makes the watch look great!!!
"A protective case that is very easy to remove. For me, that is a bonus.<br />Instead of plugging my phone in to charge it, I bought (through Amazon) a couple of wall chargers and a few extra batteries. When my battery gets low, I simply swap out batteries. I have to take the back cover off of the phone to do this. It takes only seconds, but if I had my phone encased in one of the phone armors, it would be a pain. This case serves the purpose very well."
1200 hifonics brutus on 2 of these are perfect at a 2 ohm mono for the price. Recommended if money tight and want great music
The cables work to connect to USB ports but I can not get them to work with a charging unit to charge my phone.  They serve to transfer data but don't charge.
I'm giving this phone two stars because it looked really awesome and sleek but I really didn't get to use it because after maybe a week the power button stopped working and so I thought if I took out the battery to restart it that it would change something but silly me the power button didn't work so it never came back on and I have it just sitting on top of my refrigerator.
This is a great case. It is a perfect copy of the Griffin Survivor case. The fit is exact with no looseness or off-center cut-outs. I can't speak to the waterproof-ness/water resistance of it yet but definitely protects well against drops.
got water damaged two minutes it got into the water the whole phone is gone not recommended
Excellent case. My iPhone with pong case fits perfectly.
"I was very pleased with this purchase. It fits my Note 4 perfectly and I really like the soft leather-like feel of the back. It does add some bulk to the phone but it's not too bad, I can still manage the phone easily with it...I have a  gold Note for and the red and gold case just compliments it perfectly... I highly recommend this...You will be pleased.."
"i just got it and for the price , it would be five star because it was easy to connect. to pair use FN + C together to turn on the pairing. then when your device ask you to enter the number to connect. once it is connected it stay on pretty much without issue. sometimes it would disconnect but when you press enter again it would connect.<br /><br />this is great since it has a mouse connection also<br />the rechargeable lithium battery is great so i don't have to buy alkaline batteries<br /><br />i just bought another one for another android device"
"Cords could be longer considering the numerous designs of multiple automakers. Location of AUX plug vs. location of 12V plug have to be close to each other. If AUX is on head unit/radio, shouldn't be a problem. If AUX plug is located in glovebox like mine, some issues might arise. The length of the cord(s) made it, barely however. I do like the car charger it comes with. Stays put. Doesn't eventually work it's way out like truck stop chargers have a tendency to do. Works fine. Plug into car charger and into AUX. Light flashes. Search for it with your device. Done."
"The product was mailed in a timely manner. I love this tempered glass, it went on easy. I would love one for my iPad 2 air."
Can't use the case. After trying to secure it as tight as possible the edges of the case bend and the screen of the case pushes forwards. Please avoid this. Not worth the frustration
"UPDATE: Anker Direct sent me a replacement battery for the dud I received, and it works great!! There are a lot of companies that will just say &#34;Sorry about your luck&#34;, but the customer service at Anker Direct was outstanding!! They kept me informed at every step of the way and contacted me again to ensure that the replacement was satisfactory. It's customer service like this that would keep me coming back!!"
Works perfectly. My only issue is that I can not tell how much charge the battery has left. It hasn't run out on me yet and I have used it for quite a while to recharge my phone at certain times when I was not near a wall charger. Does exactly what I need it to.
"I remember the days when first generation cellphones came out when people used to hold them like bricks to their head and then there were days when teeny tiny clam-shell cellphones came out which were small but had dismal battery life. Then very soon following that not too long ago when first generation touch screen tablets came out. Soon followed by a new breed of hybrids.. which were called Smartphones! these were actually Cellphones with touch screens which just kept on growing and becoming bigger and bigger in 'screen size' while getting thinner and lighter while at the same time getting smarter by adding more and more capabilities.<br /><br />In that category of smartphones, In the year 2015 Blu's Studio 7.0 II is the biggest I've seen yet in the smartphones category to an extent it even has a new official name - Phablet! It's a phone as big as tablet hence called (P)hablet. History lessons aside, let me tell you, After playing around with this massive phone for past few days I find that 'BLU Studio 7.0 II' unlocked device is very capable smartphone which performs like most other manufacturers like Samsung or Apple. I wish most other major manufacturers gets bold ideas like BLU, for example inclusion of 'FM radio' and reducing overall weight then the next generation of smartphones will get better and better as years goes by.<br /><br />Having said, The primary reason one would buy 'BLU' Brand versus any other 'Samsung' or 'Apple' device is PRICE. You cannot beat the price of this unlocked smartphone Period. The features and functionalities are similar if not better! when compared to Samsung or Apple and costs you way cheaper. The second reason is for someone looking to get the full functionality of both a tablet and a phone in an all-in-one package that is lightweight. This phone does offers features to users on a budget that they may not be able to otherwise afford not to mention the freedom to choose any cellphone carrier you wish which to me is a huge freedom.<br /><br />Also, At this price point you have to keep your expectations low and you will be pleasantly awarded with total satisfaction!<br /><br />PROS<br />[+] Very low price of ownership<br />[+] Excellent Battery life!<br />[+] Unlocked Smartphone, No contracts, accepts SIM from AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Cricket, MetroPCS, Straight Talk (SPRINT does not work)<br />[+] 1.3 GHz Quad Core Processor with dedicated Mali 400 GPU 1 GB RAM<br />[+] Android 5.0 Lollipop (Latest Android Operating System)<br />[+] Expandable with Micro-SD card slot (up-to 64GB)<br />[+] Capable Apps can be moved to Micro-SD card to free up Internal storage<br />[+] FM Stereo RADIO with Recording capabilities<br />[+] Bluetooth, GPS, Accelerometer, GSM Quad Band 3G HSPA+ (850/1700/1900)<br />[+] Front facing camera for SKYPE or Google Hangouts<br />[+] Very little bloat-ware (Very less junk software pre-installed)<br />[+] Stereo Earphones included, Stereo standard headphone jack<br />[+] Uses good old full size SIM (I call this a plus because you can always buy an [[ASIN:B00G26XWDI SIM Card Adapter Kit]])<br />[+] YouTube works great!<br />[+] Netflix works great!<br />[+] Get all apps from Google Play store!<br />[+] Get all the apps from Amazon using Amazon Underground<br />[+] Lightweight design only 294 grams!<br />[+] Power adapter included and USB data/charge cable included.<br /><br />CONS<br />[-] Included earphones are bad quality<br />[-] Need to be careful with a small screw for SD/SIM slot to keep it secure.<br />[-] Touch screen is slightly less responsive<br />[-] Screen same as Samsung Tab 3 7-inch '1024x600' 169ppi<br />[-] Poor quality photos from camera<br />[-] No LED flash available<br /><br />Despite these above mentioned minor cons this smartphone is still very snappy due to the Faster Quad core processor (CPU) with Dedicated Mali 400 GPU along with 1GB of RAM. The 8 GB internal memory (5.62 GB available) did not hamper for playing games most as most can be moved to external SD card. This smartphone works well for most internet browsing activities using Chrome or opera browser or watching videos locally from SD card or online. Cellphone quality was decent (I attempted AT&amp;T SIM card) and voice quality was just like any other cellphone.<br /><br />So in the end, You might ask then for which type of audience this device is really aimed for? - In my humble opinion, if someone is already looking for the largest phone possible and doesn't want to spend a lot of money or get into lengthy contracts with cellphone providers who charges arms and legs every month to give you a teeny tiny name brand device which you need a magnifying glass to see the screen. Or a person who uses 7-inch form factor tablet a lot but rarely makes phone calls and want conveniences of a phone whenever needed then this device is perfect for them.<br /><br />Overall, based on the few minor quibbles I am rating this with 4 ½ stars, But, since Amazon's rating system does not allow ½ stars so, for being fair I am rating this with Five stars.<br /><br />Cheers!

the material is cheap . I had it for about 2 months now & having a lots of problem on it..for instance..the volume is low...disconnect by itself many times while the battery is full
As advertised ... a lot of information in a small package. Even does a powered antenna which I don't have. This was installed in an RV and connected to all of the speakers so we have music throughout.
I want to love it but the case doesn't allow me to use the s pen. The opening is at the wrong angle and the s pen will not pop out. The only way to use it is to remove the case. That is ridiculous and overly time consuming. The look of the case is beautiful. Just not functional
Terrific.  Easy to install.  I can listen to sound tracks on YouTube and not bother anyone.
I drop my phone all the time and this case has really protected my phone. The price was amazing.
loved  them  and i  would have  put  5  stars  but  recently  one  side  stopped working  i  dont know  what  to do  im not in the  economic position to  waste  almost  40 dollars  what t o do?
"Took a month to receive. Didn't have all the colors in the picture, came with 2 black and 2 lime green. Didn't come with the blue, or the grey watches"
"One of my favorite cases i have ever bought. Great protection, and i loved the kick stand."
"This case is exactly what I was looking for (basic clear case) to prevent my phone from slipping out of my hand and putting my id and credit card into the back of my phone so I can forgo using a wallet. However, the clear plastic yellows very quickly which is okay if you have a gold iPhone but would look atrocious if you phone is not gold."
Waste of money. Does not work at all for any of my Apple electronics.
Works well and arrived on time. Easy to use
Was perfect for my caveman husband who doesn't want a smartphone! Hooked up to our verizon acct without a hitch
This case works and looks nice. My only complaint is there are small cracks in the red rubber sections. They don't appear to affect the function of the case but I'm afraid they will get worse in the future.
Fast shipping! Great case!
This is a great leather color (brown) and smooth feeling leather wallet. I love it..... It is perfect!
"Finally, a product worthy of it's name. Cellphone Holder. Solid construction, been under heavy use for 3 months now on construction sites for all my guys. No issues."
Best headphones ive ever owned. But a fat air waitress broke them and now i cant buy them from here again. Well there great...
"This is the closest thing to a perfect phone for someone using Microsoft at work and uses the phone as a tool to help productivity and not for entertainment.  (It may well be great for entertainment, but I don't use it for that.)  Battery life is exceptional.  In the time that it has taken to recharge my Samsung Galaxy 4S four times, the 640 is at 76% battery and reducing by 1.16% an hour.  It does not have some of my favorite apps yet, but it does have several, like Evernote, Mint, Wikipedia, Amazon, Dropbox, LastPass, Pandora, Spotify, TeamViewer, TuneIn Radio, and a great Maps app that I like even better than Google.  Phones like these will just ensure the developers create apps that work across all platforms.  The import of contacts, pictures, files, music, etc., from the Android phone was a breeze.  And importantly, Google does not have access to all my contact data.  You can clearly see which apps are using contact information and you can shut them all of if you choose.  Bye, bye, Google."
"I would give this 5 stars if I could figure out why it has suddenly stopped recharging quickly. I have had it plugged in for a couple days now and the 2nd bar is still flashing charging. I am using an iPad charger to plug the supplied USB into it.<br /><br />Outside of that frustration, this is amazing. I don't think my issue above is typical, and I would certainly buy another. I recommended to my dad, and he love sit as well.<br /><br />I do not have an outlet near my bedside, so I use this to charge my phone and watch every night with plenty of charge left over to take it with me the next morning. I have a plug in my Jeep and will charge it back up on my way to work, or on my way home. Just really nice to have around with all these devices we have. Between phones, iPads, watches and now vaporizers, there are many devices to keep charged up throughout the day. This works on all of them.<br /><br />Now, I am off to research my above issue. I'll update my review once I discover my issue."
"the battery may not last the full day,<br />Otherwise good design, fit and finish and quality."
i ordered this for myself but i was gifted one before receiving this one in the mail so i decided to give it away to my co worker it lasted about 3/4 months and while she was out on a hot day it melted so she said. idk how that happened but it is very hot here in texas so... three stars
This phone case protected the phone from a 50 foot drop which included hitting a steel roller coaster frame before crashing to the ground leaving the phone and case with only a tiny scuff mark on the corner!!!
I absolutely love the case. Perfect fit and everything… but when it's on my phone I get no service whatsoever. It loses wifi connection && my provider bar says no service. I've tried it in two different states (IL && NC) but nothing gives. So sad because it's really pretty! Now it's collecting dust in a drawer on my desk.
Beautiful case for Iphone 6+. Well made with top quality materials. Beautiful color scheme with accented stitching. I bought this one because I had one for my Nexus 5 in cognac also great case.
"A little tight with the outterbox case but works perfectly fine.  I took off one star due the water restraint, would mean that u could run in a light rain and not worry about your phone your wrong"
"Takes forever to charge with solar. If you were stranded this is definitely not going to help you if solar is the only charge you can get. The manual says it can charge a laptop,that's pure nonsense.  It can charge my Samsung tab 12.2 , androids,smartphones but not laptops. and that's it. One charge and battery juice is down to 25 %."
"With so many terrific reviews here and on other websites, I was excited to receive this. As promised, easy to install. The phone does sit several inches above the bar which I didn't particularly like. BUT, worst, when I road over a speed bump, the mount separated from the base and the mount and phone went FLYING! So much for the seller's statement that your phone will 'never' come out. Disappointed, and unable to trust the product, sent it back."
"Excellent cables.  Works on all my lightning devices without problems.  Very strong and well made.  The cables are quite stiff compared with the standard Apple cables, making them a little more difficult to roll up and store. But the stiffness is a function of the strength and quality, and also keeps the cables from tangling.  Will definitely buy these again when I need additional cables."
Good one for my money. Needed a factory unlocked phone and I like Samsung over Apple. It is 3G enabled.
"These are really really nice. Some of the best cases I've come across. I like that you can change the colors of your case like you actually have 3 different cases in one. Very nice. They are thin but very very sturdy. They're durable. The colors are nice and sleek, having this expensive look. I think it's able to put on without instructions. I was able to slip it right on. The black case also had the extra screen protector on it. That one is also nice. I really can't find anything I don't like about this case. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. You get so much in one package for the price of one item. This product is a great investment. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review but would gladly purchase at full price. I love the sleekness and this durable look to it. It's not bulky like the otterbox but will give you the same protection. This is a good investment if you're thinking about it!!"
Waste of money. Have to press hard to type or click apps on sides of the screen. Messes up texting way to much.  Cannot keep protector on I had to take it off and hope for a refund.
Great comfortable wireless headphones! Works great in bed if you're trying not disturb others! Has lots of great features! Definitely my favorite so far and can't beat the low price!
Love it!  Recharges our Samsung Galaxy s5 phones (with wireless charging backs) just perfectly!
"This was extremely easy to set up and easy to use! I'm still learning how to use it and figuring out what exactly it does, but it was so simple. I've already suggested it to many friends. I spent years talking on the phone while driving, but various &#34;accidents&#34; I have heard about made me commit to never using my phone in the same way while driving. I'm trying to limit my use in the car, but for those times when it is extremely helpful, this little bluetooth hookup is perfect."
Arrived super fast! Ordered on a Friday night received on Sunday morning and payed for regular shipping. Screen looks great on phone and was easy to put on.
Worked for one month and then it stopped charging the Apple devices.  The green light illuminates showing the Apple device is fully charged but it isn't charging at all.  I'd like a replacement but the item is already outside of the return window timeframe.  Looking for a resolution.
Great.  I had a Mophie on my 4S and that was good.  But Lenmar Meridian 2300 just as good if not better and less than half the price.
"Let's be clear about this. This stand is only for Apple Watches.  I got this stand for my husband, who has the Samsung watch, because it was offered to me at a discount for an unbiased review. My mistake. This stand only works for Apple. In order for it to work for Samsung, my husband had to jigger it to get the wire up the neck to the watch. It works fine, but it's not an elegant solution. If I were to rate this product for use with Samsung, I would give it 3 stars.  I subsequently gave the stand to my sister for use with her Apple Watch. She gives it a 5 stars. Use the product the way it was designed and it's great!  So averaging the 3 and 5, I've given it 4 stars.  *** I received this product at a promotional discount in exchange for an unbiased review. ***"
They were good for a few weeks than I went to plug one into a phone and it started to smoke. A week later I came into the office and one of the cords was smoking and began melting. I would not recommend.
"Great for listening to music all day, gym or home, but the mic sux."
"Item not as advertised and defective upon delivery. 1. This is not a 30000mah battery, stated specs are a lie.  2. No instructions as advertised.  3. Item was defective upon arrival.  The box was in great shape but one of the paternity pouches inside had shorted out swelling it up like a Ballon. Case was distorted and broken, also distortion cracked solar panel rendering it useless.  I tried to contact seller a week before writing this review, still no comunication from seller. Do not trust this seller. Product is a scam."
The metal part broke that connects the ear bud to the plastic earhook. This happened shortly after I purchased them. The ear buds do not stay in my ear and the earhook is useless (especially when it's broken). I wouldn't recommend this product.
The product arrived quickly and appeared as described but within a week the rubber case started breaking off as if it was old and brittle. Not worth having.
"Shipped fast to the door and the packaging looks great so my juices started flowing ounce it arrived. Charged it and down loaded the limitted apps and wha-la .....Maybe I expected something close to the apple watch functionality which it clearly was NOT. Worth the money I spent? Yes, If you go the cheap route you get a cheap watch spin-off. Just don't expect many compliments...Enjoy"
This a great cable and works without any issues. I actually feel like this is better quality than the one from Apple.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest review .
Ordered on Friday evening arrived before lunch time Sunday. Had it mounted on my sportster in about 5 minutes and works great.
"I have trusted OtterBox for as long as I can remember; however, I have become addicted to LifeProof over this last six months. I guess I liked the clear case and slick look. Nonetheless, when I put this case on my Galaxy (work-phone), I remembered why I LOVE OtterBox. The pattern here might not be appropriate for all work-places ... but it's still pretty cool! And, if this case WILL hold up to a serious drop, it will (obviously) protect your phone from scratches and scuffs.  LifeProof is PRICY. And, when I put this on, I realized that OtterBox is slightly better for everyday use than LifeProof (unless you are a devout hiker or outdoors person ... then, LifeProof might be the way to go).  So highly recommended!"
"didnt stick in one of the edges and its little bit smaller than the screen, i had Orzly® it was perfect"
This is a very good product.  My vehicle is and older model and the fit in the CD player is a little loose but it stays in and works flawlessly.  This make handling the phone much safer.
"I am in love with this phone! I bought it in gold...shipping was right time. Battery life is great if you are a light user. If you are a heavy user like myself, you will have to charge at least once for the day."
Been using this detector for a couple of months now and it does very good job of alerting me of police presence. Definitely use the app with this detector because it helps me monitor my speed and it's a nice tool to report false positives as well as real police presence. I never expected such a good detector that is also a budget detector and I have owned some expensive ones over the years.
"Using as a transmitter, worked as expected for a couple of days, 2 hours or so each day.  Always recharged, before use. Then, it began to cut off, not stop transmitting, completely shut off.  First time this happened, it had been working for 5 minutes before shutting off.  Next time I used it, it lasted for 2 minutes.  Currently, it will transmit for about 15 seconds before dropping out.  1 or 2 devices paired, it does not matter.  Update: Contacted Keedox support within a couple days of the original review and explained the issue.  They indicated that it was likely a battery issue and quickly sent a replacement unit.  Charged it and, to date, it is working without issue.  High praise for customer service."
"Everyone loves my case. Its such a loverly color and make the gold on the phone really stand out. The only thing I would probably change is the way we are to assemble the case because every time I take my phone out of my pocket, The pieces separate, Leaving my phone exposed. I still Love the case though and wouldn't mind another."
"These are theee absolute worst speakers DO NOT GET THESE and make the biggest mistake I did and blow a bunch of money on these s***ty things.  They distort like crazy and one already sounds blown and just got them professionally installed yesterday!!!! I could tell it was gonna happen by the way they sounded turned up. This is crazy. My infinity kappas sounded waaaayy better than these and were half the price!!! Do yourself a favor and buy the kicker ks speakers. They sound amazing. They have amazing midbass and great highs without being harsh. But it all depends on what yu like.. My stereoshops owner like the infinity kappas better, but I like the kickers waaay better. Kappas are very crisp clean sounding speakers and don't distort like these. These sound cheap compared to kappas. And I had the kappas with and without an amp. Haven't hooked up the amp to these yet though. I'm going to switch to the kickers cuz I hate these so much. Make sure yu get amp for kicker ks. Haven't heard them without one so yu need to get amp if yu wanna hear what those babies really can do. And they're $50 cheaper than these"
These were just what my Girlfriend needed. Great price and fast shipping.
Product failed about 10 months after it was installed. Good while it lasted. Would recommend to find a higher quality product.
"As noted in another review, I now have three mophies and love them.  They sure help out when you are out on the town and your phone runs out of charge.  Love it!"
Got it in the mail and the back cover was all ready falling off. I had to glue it back on.
Useless product. It doesn't charge my phone correctly. LG G3 needs 2 A charger and the item description says it supplies 2 A for Lg G3 phones. However what I see is that the charger is outputting only 0.98A with 14.2V input in my car. Stay away from this product
I really like this product. I ran a 10K in the rain shortly after buying it in the beginning of July and my phone was fine. This past weekend (end of October) I ran a 10 miler and it has never given me any blisters or even rubbing marks. It is starting to show wear but only where you insert the phone. When I run in my neighborhood I put my front door key in the key slot and it fits securely but I leave a small ring on the key to help pull it out. When I wear this one out I'll definitely buy another one!
Great concept but does NOT protect phone - the day after i began using this i dropped my phone and the screen cracked! Also it's not entirely functional as you can only fit a couple cards inside or else it won't close.
I have bought Garmin in the past just not the model with voice command I like this product !
While i received the product for a free trial i had no trouble with the battery life. The battery life lasted well over 3 hours which was expected since it is supposed to last about 5. The sound quality was amazing even after the 3 hours of walking around my town.
Great inexpensive case
This case is absolutley amazing. For our vacation we went to Panama City beach and this case worked great. It first was extremely thin. It case easily slip into a pocket or handbag without taking a ton of space or making your pockets look bulky. The beach is perfect for putting this case to the test. Between the sand and ocean water nothing got in the case. All our clothes and bags were covered in sand but none made its way into the case. There's so many benefits to it. The only con I could think of was that there's no color choice. Overall though this case is absolutley great.
"Have had only a day, but can tell already that this is the first case of many I will enjoy holding my phone in, and not regretful I covered up the beautiful Galaxy Edge too much. It is a classy, well engineered case."
Bought this for my 16 year old son so he could track his activity.  He uses it everyday and it is keeping him on track in terms of getting into shape for hockey season.  Bright screen and easy to use.  Perfect product to push and motivate yourself.  Highly recommend.
Just as all of these things...flops around...loose...and honestly just dangerous.  I am happy with the magnet setup.
"PRO:<br />Charges our iPhones (lightning connector), and does not overheat and melt the cables.<br />CON:<br />None so far.<br />NOTE:<br />AVOID: the [[ASIN:B00622AG6S PowerGen 2.4Amps / 12W Dual USB Car charger Designed for Apple and Android Devices - White]]<br />This mode will Melted iPhone lightning cables."
"Fast delivery, product quality is great. Have used it twice in a run and it is working out perfect."
"Charges both my Samsung Galaxy Note 4's at the same time. Quickly!<br />The rate of charge needs to overcome the rate of discharge- which is exactly what this does for 2 devices.<br />It charges fast for 2 devices. Both charging ports are over 2 amps.<br />Quality good. Feels sturdy.<br />Has a small led light.<br />It's not a bright LED light, that's distracting.<br />It's not blinding.<br />Smaller profile- does not stick out too far.<br />It looks nice too.<br />Bought 2, one for each car.<br />So someone I know, will stop taking the &#34;good charger&#34;"
"Very disappointed. Was not the right size. Even though it was only $1.00, it was a waste of money."
Okay normally persons would buy the phone first and then the case. Well not me. I decided that someone will give me an iphone 6 for Christmas so why not think positive and grab the opportunity to review the case. I must tell you that this product did not disappoint. The quality was superb and I did not realise that there were bonus items such as the protector and stylus pen. It is a very durable product and it fits well on my son's iphone 6 so I know it will work. My only problem is how do I get my husband to play Santa Claus and get me the iphone 6 for Christmas????. I think I will keep leaving the case around the house with messages in it. &#34;For your wife's new iphone 6 just because you love her!!  You can message me if you have any other ideas :-(
Love love love! It's a rubber case which I prefer! The actual case is gold with the white polka dots!
Delivered in 2 days as per norm. The metal belt clip had come UNGLUED sometime between manufacturing and delivery. Junk
"I rarely ever leave product reviews, but this really is a great case! It's super thin and provides protection from scratches without adding bulk to the phone like most other cases. Someone recommended it to me, and I was skeptical at first, but I'm glad I bought it. I even bought two different cases at the time and will be returning the other one."
"loved that I got this screen protector and an awesome promo code just for a review, Cant get this kind of deal anywhere else"
"Aukey 10400 mAh external battery with a quick charger QC2.0 port is a great product to consider if your phone supports QC2.0 technology.  Consistent with other products, it arrived in environmentally safe packaging, but I was surprised they included a generic usb charging cable.  Considering both of their car charger and usb wall charger came with high quality 20AWG cable, I was expecting to see one bundled in this package too.  At the same time, packaging is very compact without too much extra room around battery (size 3.8&#34; x 3.2&#34; x 1&#34;), perhaps the reason why they didn't include a thicker cable.<br /><br />Battery itself is very slick with an aluminum alloy surface, and nice flush mounted power button on one of the side-ends.  Next to it you get 4 bright blue leds indicating charging capacity in 25% increments.  Input micro-usb port supports fast 5V @2.1A charging of the battery which is an improvement in comparison to most other external batteries with 1A charging speed.  It's about time companies start to implement fast input charging considering high capacities of these batteries.  10400 mAh is not a joke and considering a typical 90% efficiency - you still get a nice capacity, and a noticeable weight of about 365g.<br /><br />There is a single charging output, but with a support of QC2.0 quick charging you get either 5V @2.1A, or 9V @2A, or 12V @1.5A, depending on your device QC2.0 implementation.  I was a little surprised that for this larger size and high capacity battery only one output charging port was included.  At the same time, the design decision was to leave top of the battery clean, while moving all the power and led controls to the side-end of the battery, thus leaving no room for a second output port.  It's a small trade off, but you do get a very cool looking slick battery.<br /><br />For under $30 this is already a great value for 10400 mAh battery, but if you factor in a slick aluminum housing, clean controls, fast input charging, and support of fast QC2.0 output charging - the value definitely goes up.  Also don't forget Aukey's 18 months warranty.  Definitely another good external battery QC2.0 source to consider.nd support of fast QC2.0 output charging - the value definitely goes up.  Also don't forget Aukey's 18 months warranty.  Definitely another good external battery QC2.0 source to consider."
after a few months of use it doesn't fit quite as tightly but still does the job.  Phone has only fallen on a hard surface 1 time and the case protected the phone - not a scratch
Very limited range. Sketchy connection at only 8 ft. Feels like a waste.
This watch is great check the youtube unboxing for more details specs feature the whole nine see what you get before you buy .<br /><br />Pineapplepat1 on youtube http://bit.ly/1ehlN0T
"Looks washed out and really cheap, like a very cheap fake copy. Never again. I expected a licensed product..."
Rig works good.  English instructions are bare minimum.  They should be expanded.  I had to use YouTube to find out how to really manually program the radio.
"This is a great phone mount. It fits snugly in my Mini, and is easy to see and manipulate."
"It was exactly what I was looking for in a smart band before I started experiencing problems.The screen will eventually go out and stop working. Garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit with a 90 day warranty. Woke up this morning to find that the refurb will not power up and when you attempt to reset it by connecting it with the charger, the unit starts to rapidly heat up, potential fire hazard had I not noticed. 2 fellow coworkers that each bought 1 of these under my recommendation are going thorough the process of warranty claims right now as well.<br /><br />It really was a 5 star device out of the box, but unfortunately its just a flawed device. I surmise that if reviews went back and updated their shinning 4 and 5 star reviews, you would see more evidence of how flawed the Vivosmart band truly is.<br /><br />Thank you for your time."
"I've had this case for about 7 months now. Still looks and acts perfect. It's a bit bulky, but I never have to worry when I drop my phone or when my two year old grandson gives it a sling across the room, which he does, often....lol Real ease to keep clean and looking good as new too. I'm about to buy another one just like it only I'm gonna change up my color."
I have had this case for 2 years and still love it. It is durable and has protected my iPhone from multiple high drops.
Many never worked and some worked for a bit. I bought them for work and a few of the cubes blew out in a matter of hours. 2 produced smoke!
"Got my charger yesterday and immediately opened it, plugged it in, and plugged my devices to it. I love that it automatically detects how much power is needed to charge your device and releases a charge accordingly. I don't have to look and see if I'm plugging my iPhone and iPad into the correct cables since they both use a lightning cable. So it's convenient and it saves you space. I need a power strip by my bedside just to charge my phone, iPad, plug for my lamp and whatever else but with this charger, you can plug up to 5 USB cables all while using just 1 wall plug. I timed the charging time and it works just as we'll as the regular wall plug. Just take caution in not overloading it. I know 1 iPhone uses 5W and I think the iPad is 10W. So combined you get up to 40W at a time with this charger. As long as you don't go over 40W, you shouldn't have a problem with charge times. Deliver was fast in the 2 days that it was guaranteed and I definitely will be buying more of these maybe as a gift for friends and family that have multiple phones and devices.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange of an unbiased review. IT REALLY IS AWESOME!"
Seriously disappointed I got this case for the note 4 and it was perfect but this one for the note 5 does not fit properly and you cannot charge the phone. Would give less than 1 star if u could. Really upset
"My Tile is on my key ring.  No more lost keys . . . or lost phone. Tile (Gen 2) can be activated from my phone to sound off and help me locate lost keys - or - pressing the hidden button on Tile will cause my phone (in Bluetooth range) to sound off.  As simple as that.  Works the same for a wallet, purse, wandering favorite stuffed animal, remote control, etc.  The Tile has a hole for putting it on a key ring.  I suppose you could attach it to about anything else using a small zip-tie.  For a remote, you could use double-sided tape.  The double-sided tape method would also work on a can of beer.<br /><br />Set up is easy:  Download the App on your iPhone (or Android) and follow the step-by-step.  Non-replaceable battery is guaranteed for one year.  Internal speaker is loud enough to hear from within the same room.  Acceptably compact at 1 7/16&#34; x 1 7/16&#34; x 7/16&#34;.  Water resistant.<br /><br />I'll probably buy a couple of more of these as a creative gift idea that is useful to about anyone.  I haven't misplaced my keys yet since hooking on the Tile, but I can't wait!"
I love it  but very hard to get phone in case in closed in wallet case . doesnt seem to fit perfectly over my s5 active phone .
Nice case!  My husband really likes it says it is just what he wanted!
"I use this all the time. Bought it for a concert, a paint rave, and it lasted through being dropped and blasts of paint. It's quick to charge too."
Alright case the bottom gold piece doesn't connect right so when I take my phone off the charger it slides off easy.
"Doesn't allow you to reach any of your phone's buttons, and the screen cover is so rubbery that you can't slide finger OR stylus on it. This is for DIVING, only and I doubt it would work well for that, either since you cannot get at the video controls easily enough."
"Fairly good case for the price, but the plastic is a lot flimsier than it looks in the picture. If you don't keep enough in the back wallet area, like only one card, it'll bounce around quite a bit. The stand works pretty good and sits at a good angle. Within a few months, it was getting worn and I was worried it'd eventually break on me in some fashion. As a result, I bought a different one not long after then. Still, for the price, this is a good wallet case that works fine for what it is."
"My problem is sweat gets between the cover and the watch, and then the watch does not respond.  I have to remove the cover and wipe after each use."
backlight is dark. LCD color is not good. the critical matter is battery drain is too much.
I've had the pile stereo on my bike for a little over a week and it has stopped working will be sending it back
great service - nice case
This little gadget is so clever. First I downloaded the free app called BT Shutter. Then I installed the battery that came with the device and turned it on. It has a wristlet strap too but I was too excited to attach it next and waited until after I played with the remote and then attached it. Then I paired the remote with my bluetooth on my phone. No sooner than it was paired I was taking pictures. I propped my camera up on my dresser and took photos of my kids running through. It was easy start up and easy to use. Just a lot of fun!!<br /><br />I was given a discount on this product in exchange for my unbiased review.
"Really good device, so easy to work with any phone definitely I will get in other one is really good price..."
"Works just as advertised. Reads volts, temperature and USB current and adds two USB outlets. The only drawback is it continuously cycles through volts, temperature, and current draw on the USB ports so you can't freeze it on one quantity."
"Wall charger did not work straight out of the box. Batteries of bad quality, only held charge for an hour abd they got deformed. Do not buy it. Dropped in the mail today to return."
"I got tired of fighting the cord a few years ago and have been on a quest to find the best Bluetooth headphones. I have bought at least 10 pair in the last 3 years.<br /><br />It seems like there is always something I don't like about everyone of them. They don't fit right, the sound quality isn't great, phone functions don't work properly, battery life is horrible and the list goes on.<br /><br />I have had these for almost a week now and love everything about them. After reading other reviews, I did order a pair of Yurbud tips to add to them and that was a good decision. The fit, with the addition of the Yurbud tips, is exceptional. I love the fact that there are no wires or cables. The band is wonderful. It doesn't hang on your neck and you don't have that stupid inline control tugging on your right ear.<br /><br />Battery life is advertised at 8 hours and I have found that to be accurate. Sound quality is above average. There is good separation and distinction in the sound and just the right amount of bass for me. The audio quality on phone calls is very good as well and all of the control functions are handy and easy to use.<br /><br />The only negative I have is about the case/armband that is included. It is a very nice case and probably a $20 value on its own but there is no 6+ option and the armband component makes it less functional as a case. But that is just petty, nit picky stuff because fit & function are phenomenal and that's what you buy headphones for anyway.<br /><br />I also have a pair of BackBeat Pros and the addition of the Fits have made me a devotee of Plantronics. Great sound, great quality and reasonable prices."
"the quality of the image is way worth than the photo its self, but i mean it really does protect from a fall!!!!"
"Bought it for my IPhone 5s and it fits perfectly. It has helped protect my phone from several falls that would have ended up in scratches and scuffs. It looks nice and sleek and provides adequate protection for the average person.<br /><br />Only issue I have is that it is a dust magnet. It seems to trap dust really easily and I do have to take the phone out of the case every couple of months to clean it out, but other than that, a great case for the IPhone 5s."
Worked perfect.  No complaints.  Long cord a plus.  Obviously good quality.
"The sound does not synchronize well with the motion of the car ... If one is supposed to turn to the right at an intersection, the sound will not give the prompt until one is exactly at the intersection. I expect the prompting 20 to 25 yards before I get to the intersection..<br />I expected it to come with a package for the kit ... this never happened. I will appreciate if it can be replaced."
"It fell out of the magnet carrier, while I was wearing it - after referring to the user manual for proper use - and it's gone! Sam's Club (where I bought it) wouldn't refund me my money or exchange it. Contacted Misfit, and they won't refund or exchange it either. They will offer me a discount if I buy a new one, and they brag about their new, stronger magnet technology! They obviously know their old one was/is defective."
It's an ok cover for the money but it is VERY HARD to remove from holster when you have to so rubber outer shell is stretching wont buy again
"bought this to use on a disney trip while in the parks, excellent!"
The case fits my phone like a glove. Looks great and not bulky at all. Even dropped my phone a few times and still works great. The initial screen protector I got came with a few cracks but I got a replacement from the seller a few days later. Works great. Touchscreen still very responsive.
This worked really well for about a month then it started going downhill.  I could hear people but they couldn't hear me and then it wouldn't hold a charge and would be signalling low battery after 30 minutes.  When it alerts you to low battery it disconnects the call.  Buy something better.
"Reading the number of reviews should tell you how good this dash cam is.  Easy to setup and get started and also has a downloadable software (FREE). Wonderful for taking SHOTS Pictures as you drive as well as more than 4 hours of video. The chip will loop over old created video. With the GIRO it will stop recording and start recording when the vehicle stops. Investigators will enjoy the hands free recording while placed about anywhere inside the vehicle. With everyone not being so truthful, this will help with what was happing inside as well as outside the vehicle before an accident. With the software you can map out everything. Outstanding for reading plates as well as decals, So YES, I like it, and fully recommend it to anyone interested in DASH CAMS with a wide view of the road ahead or add another for the rear window."
Terrible phone. Screen breaks after a 4 inch drop. Don't buy this phone! It has terrible software and it costs 229 dollars to fix the screen.
"This case was sent to me for review.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Def. does what it's supposed to. Case comes with instructions on how to turn on flash feature for your phone.<br />2) Glow in the dark inner frame.<br />3) Tactile buttons. ULAK has done a VERY good job creating this tactile feel.<br />4) Comes in many different colors.<br />5) Covers all sides. Protective case.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Sort of hard to put on. From a scale of 1-5 (5 being VERY difficult to put on) I'd rate this a solid 3.5.<br />2)Back plastic leaves fingerprints.<br />3)The flash lid(?) isn't attractive<br /><br />Great case for the price. Functions work well, good protection for your phone."
"Looks just like the photo and worked beautifully but one month in the cord split from the head on the part that plugs into the phone and began to unravel from the inside.  Maybe a fluke, but disappointing nonetheless."
"I’m a huge fan of TaoTronics products in which Sunvalleytek sells on Amazon.  I’ve have purchased a plethora of items from them.  Now the time came for me to order a CAR DVR.<br /><br />I wanted a Car DVR for extra protection when I’m driving.  If somehow I was involved in a car accident, I could prove that it wasn’t my fault.  It wouldn’t be my words verses the other drivers, I would have a full recording to prove my innocence.<br /><br />Also, with the violence in this world escalating, God forbid if I had a person who had road rage or if someone decided to jump out of their car at a stop light (for whatever reason), I would then have recorded evidence that whatever I did was in self-defense of my family and I.<br /><br />Also police vehicles have DVR’s in them as a burden of proof that someone committed a crime or violation.

"Feels pretty solid while being slim, haven't had any problems yet.<br /><br />Cable keepers are made of paper, so it can be recycled along with the box."
Plenty of screen covers. The little card to apply them with is too easy to bend and there is only one.
This headset is light weight and easy to use. It sounds great too. Excellent deal for the price.
"A compact charging plate, this device does its job just fine.  I always wondered why the Nokia plates were oblong but after using this device it's pretty clear.  If you have a long or large phone or a phone with charging coils that are off-center, then this plate may be a challenge to get charging properly.  It works just fine, but on devices like those described you end up with more of the phone hanging off the plate than on it - and that presents a challenge even if you get the alignment just right.  If you use tiny phones iPhone in size (not iPhones since they don't offer wireless charging), then you'll be fine.  One thing that may be considered a caveat or weakness, the LED.  The LED is BRIGHT. It is BRIGHT. So, if you bought this to put on your side table, or something so guest can use (like me), then don't plan on watching movies in a dark room. :D  You can color over it with a nice marker and that should work. Tape would too, but then you won't know if your phone is optimally aligned. (I apologize for the photo quality)"
This is a replacement to my previous Bluetooth earphone. Package arrived seems OPENED and there is no manual.<br /><br />I am pretty pissed about this purchase given the fact this unit probably a second-hand unit they sent me just by looking at the package.<br /><br />Item comes with some battery and hooked on my ear fine. But it seemed to me that the sound isn't very loud.<br /><br />If it's not because the sloppy packing and missing manual. I would give it a 4 star.
After one month of using the cell phone the touch screen stop to work!!!<br />The phone do not suffer any knock... just stop to work.<br />I made a hard reset but the result is the same
"Works great so far! Cable is almost twice the thickness as the OEM version, lightning connector is very solid and fits snug in my iPhone 6 Plus. USB end also fits very snug in my wall charger and Macbook Pro. I have yet to have Skiva product fail on me so my guess this will offer plenty of uses. I will be sure to update my review if needed."
Bought this for my wife for Tracfone BYOP. Works great. No complaints so far.
"Daughter likes it, only thing I am not super fond of, is that her iPod seems hot sometimes, like the case isn't letting it &#34;vent&#34; properly?"
"Ordered wrong size, needed 6plus. Nancy shop was nice and re-sent the size I needed. Nice cases though"
Feels cheaply made. Doesn't feel like it will last more than a few day. :/ not even going to bother using it.
I've been using it only for some days but it works perfectly fine for me.
It's was an excellent product I have already used it on my go pro and iPhone it come with a monopod and a iPhone holder
"Is not satisfied after a month of use, one of them went out and caught no more and no one gives me solution ; only claim to be the motherboard which do not understand the new, not recommended."
Not sure if it's truly waterproof. dropped it once in the shower - never submerged the device. It fully dried out but I'm doubting it's waterproof claim. The range is rather short - like it gets static from the closet to the bathroom. Overall OK but I wouldn't purchase again.
"Kickstand works Great, I use it often. Protects phone back and edges and actually makes it easier to hold. Have purchased the same case for all the phones like this in our family. Does NOT have the protection of the Otter Box or Life Proof, if you need that kind of protection, invest in one. This is well worth the money for basic everyday protection."
Easy to install.  Very clear and clean looking. It is like it wasn't installed.  I gave to look close to see or feel like a proyector is installed. Very happy
"It hasn't even been a month and the microphone already stopped working. Also, the design of the earphones makes them easy to fall out of your ear. Lastly, there is no volume control on the remote, only to pause and skip songs."
Case is not waterproof even though it claims to be. Brand new iPhone stopped working due to water damage with this case on
I must say I made the right choice for getting this case for my new Samsung Note 4 white.  The transparent case provides necessary protection and shows the natural color of my phone. Great idea for UAG to come up with a transparent case!
Helped protect my s5 when I dropped it into the river!<br /><br />Very happy with the quality and design of the product overall.
"Well made, good set of cables."
Slightly difficult to put together. I did the waterproof test and it said to let it sit in water for an hour. I fell asleep and let it sit for 2 hours and only a tiny bit of water got inside the case.
"I was hoping that because this was noted to be smaller than the screen, it would be a good gap for a particular bumper case, but it was pretty badly undersized. Still works, anyhow, but with something this chunky the lack of coverage is noticeable and drastically changes the way the phone handles."
"I've had my Sphero for almost a year now. Its honestly a great buy. I got it on sale on a whim as a christmas present to myself, and it has been really great so far. I keep it in my car when I go places and I pass the time playing around with it on the different apps you can get on both Android and iOS.<br /><br />My only concern is that after about the 10 month mark it started to act a little weird. From time to time it starts spinning after its done moving. It will also stop moving all together as if its gears are stripped inside, turn off, and then turn back on. All of these things are temporary however. It will kick back on and start working fine again. It was suggested to me to let the battery completely die out and then recharge it. I did that and while it doesn't happen as often, it still does from time to time.<br /><br />I don't regret this purchase though. I've gotten my values worth of entertainment out of it.<br /><br />Hope this helps!"
"A good, sturdy charger for my Samsung S3.  The price was very reasonable, and I am happy with the purchase."
"Great case, but I wish it was easier to clean the white rubber trim. I bought the white one because I like the idea of being able to see when it gets dirty, so that I can clean it as needed, but mine is stained a slightly dingy off white color. I tried soaking it in bleach water with oxi clean, but it did not seem to help much. Perhaps I need to research a better way to clean rubber or else order a different color. Something for your consideration. I hate to live disposably.<br /><br />It's a nice case, though, for the price. Adequate protection for myself and occasionally my one year old daughter who sometimes gets ahold of my phone."
These work just as they should.
"I really like how slim the case is and makes my phone lightweight.  I do not know yet how well it will protect if dropped.  Even though there's texture on the case, it still feels a little slippery, so I need to be careful when handling. But I think the slimness and lightweight makes up for that.  Definitely worth the money!"
"Seller: 5 Stars<br />Product Quality: 3 Stars<br /><br />A bit difficult to install, I even cut myself. But not a bad case, you don't have too many options for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge anyway."
Just received mine in the mail yesterday afternoon and it looks like it's years old already facing very disappointed.already fading to a white color on edges Wanted it to match my wallet and it's completely different color
This is the best case I have ever owned for any phone. The leather feels great and the overall design is exactly what I needed.
"8/28/2015-<br />I'm receiving this in the mail tomorrow. A lot of people say they will update and then don't…I WILL. This is my b4 review, because I'm really looking forward to having a fitness tracker. This is my first. I thoroughly read reviews before I buy something and there are many one star reviews who have also said the same thing and were severely let down and disappointed. Which brings me to why I am writing a review before I receive the watch… I'm TERRIFIED that this watch will perform as the one star ratings have said and waste my money. I cannot afford to waste money on this. If this watch breaks, pops out or comes off & I lose it or stops working after the warranty/month to return…it will be the equivalent of me driving down the street and throwing $140 out the window with nothing to show for it because I WILL NOT have the $ to purchase another one.<br />Update: 8/30/15<br />Received my Garman Vivofit2, so far everything's fine. It paired easily and I am not tech savvy. I'm still scared that I'm going to be one of the people that it quits on after a month or two. In that case I think I'm going to get up a class-action lawsuit, because you just can't sell stuff, especially for this price, where you know it frequently craps out on people after a month or two. I'm tempted to send it back now, but I like it, as did many people who didn't find out they wasted their money until after a month or two.<br />I can definitely address some of the issues people have had. First of all pushing the button was difficult at first because you're under the impression that you have to push in the blank space next to the screen. That's not where you push. You push on that bar next to that space. Also you have to make sure you have it snapped in the right way, so that when you push the bar you're pushing the button. Button push is fine.<br />As far as I can see it counts steps accurately. Some people claim while sitting at their desk it counted steps. I've tried sitting in one place and wildly moving my arm and it just doesn't count steps. And some people have gotten upset because if you don't move your arm, like on a treadmill then it's not going to count your step. I think this is because of GPS, which is how I would rather something count my steps, otherwise every time you move your arm it's going to count a step. That's not a step counter that's a movement counter, if that even exists. I believe it does count calories like this. I haven't been in a car yet so I can't comment on that yet. And as far as I can tell all of the other reviews people are having are all settings within the app and the computer website that you sync it to. Another problem people encountered is the watch coming out of the plastic holder it's in. That is simply because it's not snapped in securely. It is a seamless snap in, both left and right sides have to be secured correctly underneath and into the band. Unless you specifically check this it's not secured in there. The top as well has to be seamlessly secured in. I'm a pretty active person so I will be updating this regularly. I got mine with the premium heart rate monitor and that works as well and it paired easily. I just checked my app on my iPhone 5s and it automatically synced my sleep since I woke up 30 minutes ago. It would be really really really fantastic if this thing does not perform as all the one stars have experienced.🙏🏻<br />UPDATE 9/3/2015- So far everything is fantastic, except for the one thing I bought it for… Swimming in my endless pool. It doesn't give me my heart rate while I'm swimming. 😟 Under the water & waterproof yes. Even when I stop for a minute to see if maybe the heart rate monitor is just moving around because of the current, my heart rate is way below what it should be. I tested this with my polar FT for heart rate monitor and watch. I were both of them at the same time, the Vivofit 2 failed every time. I really wish the Fitbit Charge HR was waterproof, because that's the only thing that kept me from getting that one. This is going to have to be returned because it just doesn't perform like I needed to for swimming.I even tried stopping swimming for a minute and maybe letting it log my true heart rate real quick, this doesn't work either.<br />I sync it manually with my iPhone 5S many times a day & it works fine. I find both the Garmin app and the Garmin website flawless & and loaded with information about your activities.<br />I think I'm going to try the polar M400, since my polar heart rate monitor works so well.<br />I like the way the activity trackers remind you that you need to move. I find Vivo2 works well with this. I can say that even though I know I have moved sometimes quite a bit in the last hour, it beeps at me anyway to move. This is fine with me, because it makes me move even more. I always walk in order to get rid of the red line even if I know I have walked in the last hour. I know in my case that's what I bought it for… to track and engage me to be more active and that it does 100%.<br />The only difference with the polar m400 that I'm going to get to replace it is that it has GPS tracking. Both the polar m400 and the Vivofit2 have a lot of one star complaints, Fitbit Charge HR has a lot of good reviews. I really wish that was waterproof, because that's the one I want.<br />I haven't had any issues with the Vivofit 2 band popping off or losing the activity tracker that snaps into the band. So if you're not worried about swimming with that Garmin heart rate monitor I think this thing is fantastic. I like the sleep tracking too. The graph is very detailed. From what I understand the polar one is not as detailed, it just tracks time. That I'm going to miss, because I like to see the visual detail on when and how much I was restless or not sleeping deeply.  Also, polar requires $ to get the most detailed info out of there app. 👎🏻<br />Some people had complaints that it counted steps while they were in a car, I have not had this issue either.at kept me from getting that one.

"I love this thing!! Mountain biking, put 2 straps on and that thing didnt move. I could pull up music and bike app all while on my bike. Oh, even wiped out on some loose gravel and just my ear buds popped out of my ears; that thing stayed strong. Love love love"
Love them. Best stylus I have used. Great product. Have to put another order in because my family loves them also. Price great especially coming with changeable tips. Would recommend these to everyone!
"This case would have been cool but it didn't turn out the color i expected and i received it broken so like yea, other than that its alright, not the best quality but you get what you pay for."
It was for my child who unfortunately even with protection from the glass cover it still has hairline breakage on the actual glass-so this cover is protecting her phone from further damage
"Initial impression was good. However, the band that wraps around the upper arm was short in length. I have avg. sized upper arms so if you have relatively large biceps the band will be too small."
"This device has some positive and negative aspects for the LG G4.  My LG G4 has a case (SUPCASE - Unicorn Beetle) and (while the holder grabs it) it easily falls off the mount in certain situations.  I use it in landscape mode.  The bottom of the phone (on the right in landscape mode) does not stay situated and when you push a button at the left side the phone will come off.  I am considering trying a magnet of some kind.  The other major issue with this device is that the phone bounces while on the mount...and it bounces quite a bit.  I am used to a Garmin bean bag mount.  This causes eye strain and reduced readability.  I actually switched to using this phone holder on my bean bag mount and it worked well; however, the LG G4 had a heat issue.  So, this brings me to the 5 star aspect of this mount for me.  The flexibility to stretch the arm and position this holder resulted in me being able to located my LG G4 in front of a vent and continue using it as a primary GPS device.  Thanks iOttie.  But, can you please fix these other issues or provide suggestions for resolution."
"I have searched high and low for a bumper that resembles the bumper that you could purchase for the iPhone 5.... this pretty much hit it spot on, the only problem is the buttons fall off.... really wish that could be corrected. I other than that, I'm a big fan."
Great case! Seems sturdy and looks great.
"I absolutely loved it, only flaw is the tab stickers. I peeled it off but some sticky stuff left over from the sticker residue is stuck to my screen, but it's alright; because I never really touch anything in that corner"
"The original product that I received had a dysfunctional photo capture button and failed to take pictures. However, JETech customer service reached out to me before I notified them of the problem to confirm that I had both received the product and that it was working properly. After informing them of them of the defect, JETech promptly sent me a functional replacement at no cost. I am rating this product 4/5 because I received a defective first product, but otherwise would rate it 5/5 due to its price point and the reasons stated below:<br /><br />The product itself is great and telescopes to an adequate length. I have noticed that it does not extend as long as other selfie sticks that I own, but it is far enough for practical use. I purchased this product to have a compact selfie-stick while traveling and vacationing. This product is superior to others in that it does not rely on Bluetooth, thus saving my iPhone 6's battery and requires no seperate charging. The mount securely and snuggly fits an iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. Attaching and detaching my phone is quick, secure, and easy (although it does require two hands). Most importantly, this design allows for compact storage and collapses easily whereby the mount folds down, flush against the pole. Other selfie sticks have its mount hanging freely in a bulky manner. This is the perfect selfie-stick to have stowed away in a small bag or backpocket when not in use. Additionally, the wrist-lanyard offers another degree of security. Lastly, the grip is made of high quality material and comfortable to hold."
"Shipped Fast!, Went on Easy, Looks Better than plastic screen protectors.<br />This is my first tempered glass screen protector, and I wish i had gotten one sooner, it feels like its the regular phones screen and looks as good or better with very high clarity.  The kit came with everything you need, a cleaning wipe and even a lint and dust remover to use after you cleaned it and just before you apply the tempered glass protector. It went on easy the first time, just take your time aligning and you'll get it on the first try. If not, i saw videos showing removal of glass screen protectors and being reapplied without issue. I highly recommend this screen protector."
"I was very skeptical to purchase such an elaborate product online prior to my purchase. The packaging protected the product so that no damage could occur during and after travelling. As well, every part of the phone appeared as if it was bought in an Apple store."
When we got the battery it was red from water damage and didn't even work
"Great case. Super fast shipping, thank u!!"
Best unit for the amount of money spent.  Very easy to use and update.
This case is great . Protects the phone and has a great price.
"I really love this case. Does not add any bulk to the phone. Very durable. Wasnt too sure if the finger print scanner would work with the protector, but it works fine. I recommend New Trent products to all my friends and family."
Keep In Mind: Under $60.00 This Phone &#34;Smartphone&#34;Is Awesome!!!  It Definitely Gets The Job Done (Everyday Use). Quit Complaining (Mr & Mrs.&#34;High Standard&#34;). You Guys Are Either Sick Or Cheap #GetOverYourselves
BEST backup charger we have purchased.  My husband's car outlet no longer works. . he can charge both his phone and tablet.  The two charging outlets have come in handy while on vacation and on business trips.  I HIGHLY recommend this portable charger.!!!!!
"I was surprised they delivered on Sunday's! I got my case the next day, so shipping I was really happy about. Unfortunately, now that I've had this case for a couple of months now, i can see how this case can work for some and not for others.<br /><br />1. After a good amount of usage, the case will start to have white scratch marks on it. Of course, it's doing its job by protecting ur phone, but having those marks, make it look cheap.<br /><br />2. The buttons on the side are intact. I've had no issues with them, but I've read others have.<br /><br />3. To describe the color, it is on the Coral side, but it's nothing close to neon. It's not super bright or obnoxious. It's very subtle IMO."
Both this case in black and purple and I really love it but didn't receive the stylus and screen protector for the cases.
"This product is very easy to use.  I was able to convert my standard sim card into a nano sim card without any difficulty.  I followed the directions on the box with success.  Insert the sim card as shown on the box.  Ensure that the sim is in all the way.  Place the cutter on a solid surface.  Once again make sure the sim card is in all the way, then with one firm motion, push down on the card and make the cut. Its that easy.  This cutter only makes nano sim cards.  It will convert either standard or micro sims into a nano.  With the included converter, I am able to use newly created nano card in a micro sim card phone.  I would recommend this product."
This case is unbelievable!  The built in stand is perfect for hands free use.....the lightweight and durable case fits perfectly.  I love the feel of the phone case in my hand.  The stylus is a terrific bonus.  Great job!
Excellent!
"I got the package this morning , but i didn't get the front cover , only the back. I thought there was two seperate pieces.  I'm pretty bummed if it's just the one piece because it looks weird"
"Great little camera and easy to install.  However, it is only a 135 degree camera."
It didn't hold my cards well in the pockets.  They have actually come apart.
Excellent case. Fits the phone perfectly. Doesn't add a ton of thickness to the phone like some other cases.
Item came defective it was not a new unit. Called sprint and they replaced with a new unit free of charge.m. Thank you sprint
Tooo small!!!! Gets more dirty with the srceen protector
This is the first verus case I have bought. I Usually go with spigen products.  I must say I was pleasantly suprised about how good it looked in person when it finally arrived. It came in a very attractive packaging. The fit and finish is very clean and I was expecting a cheap looking and feeling product but I was pleasantly suprised about how well this is put together. The card compartment can probably fit 3 cards with no issues and the case doesn't bulk up this skinny phone by much. This case gives the very slippery s6 edge plus a good grip which if you know how slippery and unwieldy the s6+ is is a definite plus. The rubber lip also goes over the top and bottom parts of the screen so should give the phone adequate protection if it falls face flat. This case is highly practical and attractive so I think it deserves the 5 stars.
Had it less than a month before the sound started getting crackley and people started complaining that it sounded like I was talking under water
"Overall, I'm fairly happy with the Limm band. The material is thin and very light. It's easy to get my iPhone 6 in and out of it (with a Pelican case on it) and hook up my earbuds. The material is pleasing to the touch and not as bulky as other bands I've used.<br /><br />2 drawbacks: 1) the material doesn't have a lot of grip, so it slides down my arm unless I have it very tight. And more than once, just trying to put it on the lack of friction on the band has almost caused it to fall off while trying to secure the velcro. 2) The metal loop the band passes through is not a good design choice. The band tends to bunch up in the corners of the loop, causing it to twist and turn. And while the metal has fairly beveled edges, they don't feel great pressing in your skin.<br /><br />I've found that wearing the band over a long sleeve workout shirt gives me the best and most consistent performance. The band stays in place and the metal loop doesn't press into my bicep. However, I don't enjoy wearing it with short sleeves, when it pokes my flesh and falls down much more readily."
Spraying a liquid solution on an electronic device is only asking for trouble that the manufacturer will not be responsible for - poorly thought out implementation. Also if anyone plans on using the fingerprint reader on the S6 edge+ it won't work with this shield.
"Lightweight, very durable and easy to attach to my new S6. Great price for a great product!"
"This is a nice case the fits the LG G3 well but the kickstand is perhaps the weakest part of case. It broke only after a month of this case being in my possession and it never properly supported my phone anyway. The hardness of the case has saved my phone several times though, so it is a pretty well made case in regards to actual protection. I just wish the kickstand placement and strength had been carefully considered when making this product."
"The last case I had for this phone was just like this but because the wrong clip on the side had a groove in it my phone would turn off every time I put it in the holster, I do not have that problem with this case. There is a hollowed out space for the power button so that nothing presses it, everything seems to fit nicely and my phone seems much more secure in this thing."
"I discovered my phone would not fit.  Because Amazon made it difficult and pretty pointless to return, I did surgery on the holder and use it as a simple lanyard minus case."
First day i used the clip broke
"Amazing product. It fits the phone perfectly and the color of the white is white instead of an off white. Which is great, they sent exactly what we ordered. The case has held up to a few drops and toddlers. I would recommend this product."
Poor camera and screen display
"When I first received this case, it had a terrible smell, but that dissipated after an hour.  I had purchased a similar case in the past, that I had problems with so I was hesitant, but I like this style.  This case is better quality than my prior one and it actually fits the credit cards or drivers license in the slots.  My other case was a tight fit and only one would fit even though it had 3 slots.  I like this case, I have only had it for a couple of days, but it is exactly what I am looking for I can carry my license, credit card and case with phone rather than carrying my purse at times. *****Update I have now had this case for a bit and it has been great,(the stitching has remained strong, last case I had purchased had fell apart) it conveniently holds my ID and credit card and/or bank card and is sleek enough that I can throw in back pocket when I don't want to carry a purse.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review, I always use reviews prior to my purchases and hope that this is helpful to others."
Nice sound for the money.
I think this is quite possibly the most badass looking phone case for the iphone 6.  It has your typical black tpu with a nice matte finish there is carbon fiber inlay in top and bottom and the entire thing has a reinforced gunmetal color bumper.  So the entire case offers very good drop protection for the phone while also making it just look plane cool.  I mean look at this you know you want to buy it.  I am a caseaholic and no exaggeration i have over 100 cases combined for the phones I have owned for over the years and this is hands down my favorite case.  If you are thinking about buying this case DONT THINK just BUY IT.  I was provided this case in return for my honest and true review.
The design is attached to the case via a sticker. It is not worth the price in my opinion.
"Great on time delivery. Had it hooked up professional to my system, no dimming hold enough power to supply and then some"
This strap is perfect replacement to my Apple Watch .It looks really nice and stylish . The material is soft and great quality . Will definitly buy more from this seller .
Excellent little camera. We bought is for my eight year old to learn in but we all use it!
Received for reduced price for honest revies.  I was scard that I would blow a fuse like my last charger did but it did not. I love the design I love how fast it charges my phone.It's cute not too heavy as not to strain your cigarette adapter. I will continue to use and update my review in a month.
My husband loves his case. Protects the phone and doesn't  make it too bulky. He loves the idea that it has a stand so he can watch videos.
"Great phone but ummm that gps made me return it. Battery life was at %20 at the end of day and that's with using it every hour , impressive I know. But to keep this review short, I was out on a road trip needed to use gps and yea it failed bad. On Google maps it failed to acquire signal, then when it got a signal it would have me in a different road, then it would update late. Also you can't use the waze app. Your location does not show up on waze at all so when you need those handy updates you can't get them. This sounds like a serious issue might need to bump the review down to 3 since gps plays important part in a lot of apps these days(yelp app). So sorry, if gps was on point this phone would be a beast with its cpu processor and battery."
I was enjoying this product a lot. Very good sound quality and the battery life is really good. But one of the year buds stopped working properly 2 weeks after using them. It's not a good quality product
"Very s***ty case, did not fit on my phone and came broken. I am extremely disappointed. However I contacted the seller, let's see what he/she says."
New features are really nice.  It shows which since of the road you'll be exiting and provides pics of the exits and off ramps.
Perfect OEM charger
Fit the phone great (s6 edge +) it also came with a protector for the back of the case to prevent scratches which is awesome.
USB cable broke the first day. Annoying. Does not bode well for the quality of the charger. We shall see how long it lasts.
I already had A nasty fall and my ride gripper kept  My phone from falling out and getting broke. it is an excellent device  to have while you're riding.
Phone was as advertised but was delivered Very late.. Needed it before traveling and I ended up having to ask a friend to ship it again.
Good sound. Ear bud was a bit big for my ear so had to cut it down but overall pleased with purchase. Works just fine with my Note 4. It does tend to pick up background noise for those on the receiving end so have to be careful to adjust volume.
"The phone looks nice. I bought it for my son. It looks almost like an iphone. The reason i bought it because it has new LTE 700Mhz band for Tmobile. I tested out on the road and Youtube works really good without buffering. For $70.00 phone, I dont think you can ask for more. However, home botton doesnt light up. The battery power is about average. I had to return mine because ear phone jack wasn't working. Other than that this phone is good."
Love this case.  Second one I've had!!!!
"Yes, these OnyxVolt cables are the only cables that last. I've only had these a few weeks or more and my daughters are the ones that use them but all the other brands that we've tried only work for a few days or more. We'll see how long they can take the abuse but so far so good. Thanks for a cable that looks as though it will go the distance, Thanks again..."
"I currently own the 42 mm black and gray Apple watch sport. This case offers amazing protection and looks great with my black sports band. As for the scratching that others have mentioned, Apple's stainless steel products have always been notorious for being susceptible to scratches (think back to the older iPod touch generations with the stainless steel plating on the back). It's just something you are going to have to deal with if you decide to go for the stainless steel version. I've inspected my aluminum Apple watch and have not seen a single scratch on it ever since putting this case on it. My only suggestion to Spigen is to perhaps come up with more available colors in the future, preferable those that match up with the sports bands that Apple sells through their websites. I plan to get the blue and green bands but don't think it would look very nice with a black case. Solid Apple watch cases are hard to come by but I promise Spigen will not let you down. They are absolutely fantastic cases. And if you do ever have a problem, their customer serviced is fantastic. Do not hesitate to contact them."
A little hard to get the latch into the holes when new but overall great product.
"Very nice product with what feels like a really good fit for the LG G4. I really like the smoked transparent effect, makes the phone shine :) They shipped me the new version where the hole on the back is one large area -- the fix to the old reviews on here about the demarcation affecting flash performance. Hopefully the pics attach this time, and you can see what i mean.<br /><br />The case is somewhat flexible, by the way -- the beauty of TPU material -- so this should be able to withstand the occasional drops and dings. If i had to nit on anything, it's that i don't fancy the port covers much. It's just one more thing to do when plugging/unplugging from the charger. Granted, i'm hoping the Qi charger works through the case, in which case those port covers will come in handy in the long run.<br /><br />Overall, good job with this Ringke!"
"Nice and tight. Doesn't move while running and the screen protector allows me to use my phone and change the tracks or take a call if needed. You'll need to take off any protective case before sliding your phone in, but that's the only &#34;issue&#34;. Ideal for running or any other physical activity!"
I have used it several times and it is sooooo handy.  It charges my android phone just as described.  I now have three mophies and love everyone of them.
Beautiful case!
It's an awesome case but the photos are deceiving. It's a glittery case. I guess I didn't read the fine print. Now I'm stuck with a case that looks like it's for little girls
"Wonderful rugged case! I have owned many different &#34;tough&#34; cases and this by far is the best value for your money! I even drop tested it with my phone from 5 feet several times without a hitch. The screen shield does leave a light rainbow effect on the display but certainly worth the added protection! The simple fact that this case comes with every color back piece along with the super protective abilities makes it a easy buy. Forget the over priced cases from otter box that the silicone wears out on, this is the one to own!"
"As Advertised delivery, quality! exceeded my expectation. Don't know how I found you while browsing and searching for a pure leather case but I'M glad I did!!!!"
Charges my galaxy note 3 in 45 minutes. Works perfect and very nice quality.
Great product!  This was recommended to me by my brother who has one.  It holds a charge several hours so you can recharge your phone or other device more than once on the same charge.  It also charges fast!
"Love this band! looks so much nicer than my white sport band. Took me a while to find a nice leather one, and this is it."
"Bought for the plug which is perfect however, when I tried to use one of the plugs, it does not fit my phone which it should. For the price, it suits my needs. Was hoping to have 2 spare cords but received just one that works."
I ordered an Iphone 5S case and received a 4 case
Without the protector my screen was the typical black hue. Once I added the protector it is now blue in color. Also for glass it feel like plastic and even bent like plastic.....I ordered the same thing for my wife's oneplus one and it was perfect I don't know what happened with this one.
Charger works and lightning fast shipping
This mount works on my Galaxy Note 4 and my Galaxy 4.  It has been on the windshield for 4 weeks during some pretty hot weather and it has not fallen off yet.  Every other mount would have by now.  I like that it holds and that it is adjustable for the two different phones.  Great product.  Shipped to me quickly and arrived in excellent shape.
The quality of theses speakers is awesome
"I purchased this product over a month ago. The case is beautiful and unique. I personally don't use cases because it takes away from the beauty of the phone. This case is much different, it fits perfectly and adds to the wow factor of the phone. The original case I ordered started peeling on the right side after a month. I contacted coverup and they responded to me within 3 hours and asked me if they could send me another. I proceeded to give them my address and questioned if I could receive the black ashewood instead of walnut. They delivered without hesitation.This is by far the best customer service I have received. They truly care about their customers and will ensure you are 100% satisfied (no, I do not work for them). I will definitely buy future products from them."
"Nice and durable. Th color is not gold, it is more of a coyote tan."
"The Pebble Steel still looks great it feels comfy, The screen looks great in daylight and at night it  silently buzzes when notifications arrive, and does it well. It works great with my iPhone 6"
Seems to do it's job!
Fit perfect. The sticky tape didn't stick very well so the screen is starting to pop off in certain areas
I'm so glad I purchased the tempered screen as soon as I put it on my phone I dropped my and it still looks new NO CRACKS!
"This is well worth ur money....  night vision is good enough....  i mean come on people,  stop comparing your night vision gizmos to a dash cam...  if u go out and spend hundreds on a dash cam with military grade night vision capabilities  and it gets stolen in a week.  What good is it...  i have a diesel pickup with 2 huge batteries and have it wired direct ... stays on day and night.  Little civic is not hooked up direct only  to key power.  because  the size of  the battery is ridiculously small... so Ofcourse there is posibility of draining the batteries there..  i hope this helps u guys decide and  the seller on all those drain my battery questions."
"This holster, though listed as fitting an LG Freedom II phone, was too wide and so didn't carry my phone snugly and instead allowed it to bounce around a little.  If I had a protective case for my phone, this holster may have been the right size.  I'm returning the item and trying to find one that is a better fit."
I love this thing. It has saved me from having to fumble around at night waking my wife up trying to plug my iPhone in. I just lay the phone on the pad and it charges it up perfectly. The power pack that comes with it is handy as well when I go out for the evening. Best buy ever.
"This protective shield is very good. It is made of plastic and covered with a rubber outer shell. The sides are raised above the surface of the phone for added protection. Rubber also covers the side buttons, but they are still usable through the ribber, but you have to press the buttons a little harder. Plenty of space is provided for the cameras and connections. The pop-out side stand is also nice.<br /><br />There weren't any instructions with it, but you peel the rubber down along the sides and then split the plastic seams along the sides of the case to insert the phone. It provides plenty of protection for the phone.<br /><br />Good protection for this phone."
They have decent sound but they cut out all the time. It is so freaking frustrating!<br />Not worth the money!
great phone case and super protective. Ive dropped my phone many many times in this case and not even a crack.
I really like this product very detailed and great protection for my new iPhone I enjoy and glad I brought this brand.
"These are by far, the best iPad pens any money can buy. I say this because I have purchased just about every other pen - including the &#34;high red&#34; Jot pen. They are silent like rubber tips and always stay smooth on ever stroke, unlike rubber tips that dry out.<br /><br />I carry this pen everywhere I my pants pockets, briefcase, shirt pockets, clipped into my iPad case.<br /><br />The Friendly Swede version provide many length and color options as well as replacement tips (which I have never had to use).<br /><br />I highly recommend the Good Notes 4 App for iPhone and iPad - it's the best writing app. Good Notes and the Friendly Swede are a powerful modern writing solution."
Fits my Samsung 3 mini very nice. I still have room in the holster to put a case around my phone. In office most of the time that it is used. So not put to heavey use. Very happy.
"It's not the same cable I got 6 months ago. This one is much thicker but feels cheaper meterial. Sometimes iPhone doesn't charge, I tried different plug and same wire, it's the wire that's acting up, even though it's brand new."
"Tools are not the right size. Tho very small torx screwdrivers come with the kit, they are a size or two too big. Will have to purchase my own. Hopefully things go well."
"The phone adaptor broke the second time I used it. I contacted the company but got no response. I'm glad that others have been happy with it but I'm very displeased. Update: I heard back from Solity and they went beyond expectation in replacing the faulty product. Four stars to you, Solity. Thanks for your support."
"This a very nice case. It is one of the rare cases that actually makes my M8 look better. Thin, sexy, simple to apply, and very nice fit. This is not the case for those who want great protection from drops and their extreme handling to their phones. This is for those who just want something to protect from minor scratches to back and edges and a little more grip when they hold the phone while keeping its slimness and natural curves on display. Texture on the back of case provides right amount of grip over the M8 naturally slick backside and feels just right.  Only complaints are the headphone hole for the case is a little too small for my thick headphone jack (same size as the ones on Beats headphones). Normal size earbuds jacks will fit fine though. Also, power button is a little concave into the case so you have to reach into a hole a little to power on. This is not a problem if you use the double tap (on Windows Phone) to wake up your phone, it is a little annoying at first when you want to turn off screen without waiting for timer.  EDIT: Another complaint; the little thin piece of the case, the piece that connects the case above the cut out for the volume button, has stretched. It is now sticking out about a 2 millimeter from the case. So be aware that it probably will have to you as well after a few months.  Overall great case for the minimalists."
"I loved this product when I first saw it. Great price and beautiful color. Shipping was rather quick and looked very nice and sleek on my iPhone 6 plus. The only downfall on this product is that is cracked very easily with in 2 weeks of having it. Mind you, I take very well care of my phone and never drop it, It must have cracked when I placed it on a table, Hard surface, etc. If your looking for something more reliable and sturdy, I would look for other options."
"You get what you pay for. The biggest issue with this case is that the flap does not stay closed. The placement of the magnet is such that the flap is too high on the case and easily opens. Also, the belt loops are flimsily sewn and will pull out soon."
"They're resending me headphones.  I can't do better than 3 stars for now.  need to see if the replacements get here timely and when they come, see if they work properly."
Fantastic case. It is very smooth and charges the battery from 50% to fill in about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Only con: You need Micro USB charger.
"Got my Juicy Case in today and I love it! It would have given it 5 stars, had it not been for one thing. The circle cut out fits perfectly on the front; However, it is not perfect for the back, where the camera lens is located. Taking photos, with it open and folded back could have been awesome, being they designed the case with double magnets that keeps it open or closed. Unfortunately though, the circle sits too low on the top edge of the camera lens, so when taking photos with it open and folded back, you get a circular shadow that blocks the top of your viewing area.<br /><br />So, unless you feel like cropping all your photos until you crop the shadow out, I suggest leaving the folio cover open like a book, but not folded back to take any photos. Other than that one set back, the case is beautiful. They thought of everything to make this case rank high above the flimsy LG slim case that I had to pay 50 bucks for.<br /><br />While the LG G4 slim case is nicely curved for sliding in and out my pocket, I never felt it was enough protection, nor can I stand it up in landscape view. Its too slick and between the material, curve, and design, it's impossible to do. I'm still expecting it to eventually tear at the fold. With the Juicy Lucy case, I feel protected, it doesn't slip and slide when the case is open and folded back. It remains intact and is much more comfortable to handle, and I CAN USE MY PHONE IN LANDSCAPE VIEW WITH THE BUILT IN STAND DESIGN.<br /><br />So.... Would I buy another one? ABSOLUTELY! It's actually the best case I've come across thus far. If only they could work on that shadow issue, the case would be absolutely perfect! Keep us updated if you guys fix that. Until then, I'm sticking with this case and I would highly recommend it! I got the blue and it's a bright beautiful blue! The leather is soft to the touch and looks very classy."
"Well  this case looks nice, i ordered it not realizing it wasnt for my phone. Overall checking it out though, its a little hard to open but has a nice compartment to hold your belongings."
"INITIALLY, I HAD CHALLENGES WITH THESE HEADPHONES<br />CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT - SUPER HELPFUL  AND<br />I RATE THE HEADPHONES ALMOST TO THE 'LOVE' CATEGORY<br />MY PROBLEM IS A SMALL HEAD AND THEY WOULD FIT BETTER IF<br />ADJUSTMENT WAS TO SLIGHTLY TIGHTER FIT.  AGAIN CUSTOMER<br />SERVICE WAS SUPER."
"I love this case because it is durable and represents my love for Starbucks! Took a bit to arrive, but the case is great overall."
"Ok can someone direct me to some real instructions? I feel like a complete idiot so I'm going to ask some perhaps idiotically simple questions here. To give you an idea of my electronic savvy-ness, or lack there of, for my own phone, I have an iPhone 4 and I don't even remember how I set it up. I have Virgin Mobile as my provider at $30 month plan for unlimited data and 300 phone mins/month. I never go over.<br /><br />Ok, so now,  In my hand I have the watch (the TBS3203, without the lights and keypad) and SIM card from H2O still in its package. Do I sign up with a plan or services with the SIM card on H2O before I insert it into the watch? Where do I get the phone number to the watch? How do I text the watch to receive the gps location back? I'm clearly not understanding the relationship between the SIM card, the phone service and my phone as a guardian phone. Can someone help? Thank you! I am excited to get this to work!"
"Got this for my mom's really old phone that she uses lol pretty cool, didn't know a wallet for this model of phone would exist though haha"
"I was very excited to get this set of earphones this week; however very quickly, I became disapointed.<br /><br />Number one, I bought these because they are labeled as sports earphone... When I got them, the packaging says that they cannot get moist or be in high humidity... I don't know about you, but when I work out, I sweat, or when I am in the gym or on a hike, it is often humid and I am sweating...<br /><br />Number two, they didn't work. The system was easy to pair with multiple phones in my house (multiple because I wanted to make sure it wasn't<br />just one phone having issues.) once paired however, the earphones did not work, only one was working.<br /><br />The positives: the unit fit nicely around my head, and came with multiple ear size adjustments. It came with a charging cord and a neat little bag as well.<br /><br />I am currently waiting for a replacement, and will adjust my review based on how the second one performs.<br /><br />********************************************<br /><br />Edited review:<br /><br />The second unit of these arrived today, and just like the first, they were simple to pair with the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6.<br /><br />Now that we had a unit with both ears working, I have to note a few things... the sound quality is not very good. My 99cent wired earphones sound better. These seem to have static, or just not a clear sound to them.<br /><br />I won't be buying these again, and will likely give them to my 11 year old for use while running.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
It worked for a couple of month then stopped charging my iPad. I guess it's too loose at the top.
"LOVE IT!!! if you're confused if it includes the stylus it does, i was uncertain if it came with it."
"The case looks amazing and fit very well, have not dropped it so do not know how well it will be as a shock preventer"
"I have 2 pairs they are great, sound is excellent, the only complaint, is that the battery life is about 3-4 hours. but for the price and performance you cant beat em"
These are awful and they are only for pc gaming. Didnt say that in the description. Pure garbage.
Had our gps for quite a while.  Finding a replacemnt for the frayed cord was impossible.  Amazon had everything we needed at a great price
This is my second purchase. It's a great case.  Protective but not too bulky
This is little nicer than your average armband. I really like their logo and the feel of it. The hidden compartment is also larger than most armbands. You get a spot for a key AND cards! I definitely appreciate the longer straps. It's not as reflective as my old one (which had a full reflective face) so I personally won't be using it at night. Giving up that reflective face produces a nicer design so I don't mind. It's perfect for the gym and everyday work outs. I got this item at a discount in return for an honest review.
"I would give this 10 stars if possible.  I know there are cheaper small packs available but the what's the $3 &#34;savings&#34; worth when you really need it.  First, I choose this item because of the additional flashlight option.<br /><br />Flashlight lasted 12 continuous hours at full brightness.  I thought the pack was dead but apparently it turns off st 50%.  I simply turned it back on and back to full power with a one hour shut off.<br /><br />Did a 90% charge on an S5 in under 2 hours (10-100%).<br /><br />Also has LEDs to indicate power remaining, nice touch for small inexpensive pack.<br /><br />Should have one in every car, brief case and purse."
"I like it quite a bit. It is what it is, a cheap, functional phone case. The stand likes to rattle sometimes, and it generally is kinda cheaply made and everything, but it saves my phone from falls, and is holding together.<br /><br />I would say that when it comes to what you get for the money, that it is well worth the money."
"UPDATE:<br />Just yesterday I was in love with these. Now I'm saying BE CAREFUL with these!<br />Today the little plastic plug that attaches to the phone's earphone jack broke off in my phone!!  Yep, the little plastic plug just fell apart and left a broken off nub in my phone. Please see pic.<br />It was VERY difficult to get out of my phone. I tried gently with a pliers, but little chips and pieces of the plug kept coming off (making there less and less area still sticking out of my phone to grab). Finally I got it out by trying to raise one last edge of the plug with a flat screwdriver. Honestly I was terrified I'd not get it out completely and lose the ability to listen to music through my earphones. Gahh!!<br />Extremely disappointed that this little gadget comes along with that kind of risk. I had rated it four stars yesterday, but now need bring it down to three because of this problem (I should probably only rate it two stars, but I still think the concept is a good idea... perhaps if the plug were metal it would be less risky).<br /><br />I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about these.<br /><br />My fingers are clumsy and large. Ever since I got my smart phone I've been pretty much relying on using the 'voice to text' feature when I text. But that is not always convenient as it can disturb other people. The price was right on these Generic 10 in 1 Bundle Mini Capacitive Stylus / Styli pens, so I gave them a try.<br /><br />They work great for texting (and words with friends is so much easier to maneuver). I have a moto g phone, the little adapter fits easily into my earphone plug for storage.<br /><br />The only downside I see is that I really wish there were a longer and stretchy cord. As it is, you only store it in your earphone jack... when you need to use it, you removed from there and replace when done. I'd rather a long stretchy cord so that I could just use it while attached and forget about it. As it is now it just sort of dangles off my phone like a tail. If it were longer I could also tuck it up into my phone cover.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just wanted to say how much I like these little guys now. I still get annoyed with the &#34;dangle&#34; every once in a while, but accurate texting is so much easier now. I've seen some other reviews that talk about the color coming off, I have not had that problem. I'm thrilled to have something so handy at such a great price. I also ordered some of the longer ones. They have not yet arrived, but am anxious to try them too!ke a tail. If it were longer I could also tuck it up into my phone cover.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just wanted to say how much I like these little guys now.

"Fake Reviews.  Returned.  This thing is huge, very bulky and not well made."
"This seller has multiple items listed for sale from this sales listing and the item we are reviewing is the black & gold colored two port unit... not the four port units.<br /><br />This dual USB port car power adapter from GRDE has two USB ports, one rated as 2.1A and the other as 2.4A max, though it has a total throughput max of 3.4A. It looks nice, works well, seems well constructed and is priced well for it's construction and output.<br /><br />No operating instructions, but then these devices truly are \\""plug 'n play\\""... insert it into your car's power port (formerly known as a cigarette lighter) and then plug your device's USB cable in. Simple, easy and very effective.<br /><br />We connected two smartphones at one time, an HTC Droid DNA and a Samsung Galaxy S3, and the charging times we experienced were stable and equal to or better than what we get from our 1A wall chargers. The unit did get slightly warm to the touch but nothing that we would consider hot. Since it is limited by the 3.4A max flow, the unit would not be able to provide full-flow charging of two high drain items at one time, but it handles a 1A Android and 2.1A tablet's demands just fine.<br /><br />The materials note that this unit is covered by a 1 year warranty, so if an issue occurs within that period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.<br /><br />We found this power adapter to be stylish, affordable, and it did the job as described by the manufacturer. If you are looking for a car charger unit of this style, size, and charge rate, for use as I have described above, then I recommend giving this GRDE Dual Port USB Car Charger a try based on our experience with it.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller several weeks ago, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience.ing experience."
"Great upgrade choice for my Samsung Note 4, as an alternative to shelling out big bucks for a new Note 5. I do wonder if the circular build of higher priced charge pads are easier to sync - there seems to be a narrow margin of error when setting the phone down to charge, it really has to be lined up just right. But all in all, a great &#34;tech fix&#34; to get over the desire to upgrade to the latest Note 5."
The color is a blue color and not a turquoise...that was very disappointing bc I LOVE. The color turquoise. But it give pretty good protection. I got this if I going hiking or do anything rough with my phone
"Great quality, also includes Velcro strip to hold loop together!"
Supreme clarity compared to the old Zagg original shields.  Easier to put on too.  Great product.
"HANDS DOWN The best headphones that I ever, eva,  owned lol. OK let me calm down (lol) now on to the review.<br /><br />The packaging that the set comes in is very, very, nice and secure. I had no issue with scratching or damage when I received them. The set comes with the headphones of course, four replacement earbuds, and a charger.<br /><br />Now to the look and style. I was extremely impressed by the look and unique design. The color that I chose was black. These headphones are sleek, stylish, and very soft yet sturdy. They are bendable so you can easily manipulate them to the comfort and fit you are accustomed to. Once they are on, they are secure. No worries that it will fall off during exercise or just moving around (or dancing around). So comfortable to wear. Very light weight.<br /><br />It took me approximately about an hour and 1/2 to fully charge them. When you charge the device, there is a red light indicator that lets you know that they are charging and once they are done, the light disappears. No guessing involved.<br /><br />Once the device was charged it was time to put it in use. I have a Samsung galaxy 3 phone so I went to my menu, selected bluetooth, then scan, and it popped right up. Then hit pair and that was it!!! So easy that I didn't even have to open or remove the instructions from the box!<br /><br />Now the sound. WOW I was amazed!!! The sound quality is excellent and extremely smooth. The bass is awesome. It sounds like you are listening to surround sound. No interference at all. High quality. I couldn't believe it. I truly wasn't expecting it. I wish I could say more but I mean they are really that good! They are clear and it sounds like the music is in the room with you. Imagine you are in a car with the best stereo system installed. That's what it sounds like. The bass, treble, everything is on point! There is a power button on the headphones along with volume buttons that you can control.<br /><br />Overall would I tell you to purchase these yes. Are they worth the money yes. Will I be purchasing them for my daughters who are in their 20's yes. I received these headphones to review in exchange for my honest opinion. But I must say if there were more stars they all would have been lit up. Ghostek has done an amazing, amazing job!!!"
"This was my first &#34;new&#34; smart phone. Had been using an HTC EVO 4G up till June when I bought this phone during the preorder for $80.<br /><br />For $80 it's a pretty good phone. Main camera is pretty good, has a bunch of features that I haven't messed with and videos look alright. Front facing camera is bad but I don't &#34;selfie&#34; so it doesn't matter.<br />Phone is pretty big, I'd guess it's in the Phablet area. Fits in a typical man pocket fine though and doesn't feel like I'm holding a book to my face. Screen is bright even outside and videos look good on it.<br />Phone speaker I can't get loud enough. It's maxed and still I have trouble hearing at times. The rear speaker is strong and projects well so if you want someone 20 feet to hear what you're listening or talking about it'll be great (just know you're a terrible terrible person for doing that).<br />Apps and web browsing is fast (compared to the EVO) and I haven't experienced any crashing.<br />An SD card is a good idea with it only having 8GB of internal storage.<br />Phone comes with a case and screen protector. If you have fingers that don't like touch screens the screen protector will be necessary. My fingers didn't want to slide at all over the naked screen. And the protector will fight you. I gave up and have massive amounts of tiny air bubbles.<br />My phone also showed up with 2 bubbles UNDER the screen, not the protector. It feels like there's something under it, like a fine sand granule. Doesn't hurt the phone or operation but it is annoying.<br />Battery lasts for awhile. I browse the net a lot and never turn the phone off. On average I can get about 40 hours on a charge but that's with airplane mode on with wifi.<br />Speaking of airplane mode, even in a GSM strong area with the bands this phone uses I don't get a signal inside. At all. Step 2 feet away from the house and I have bars. So be aware of that possibility.<br /><br />At $80 I'm happy with the phone for the most part. IfI had paid $130 for it I'd have returned it for sure though. The new Moto G would be the better choice for a little more money."
"I have a the Apple watch with aluminum casing with the original white sport band. The Tvoka black band was easy to switch out. It provided a sleek classy look to the watch. I have a medium size wrist, the band fits my arm perfectly with two band tucks to allow the excess band to stay tucked.<br /><br />Of course there was a slight change in color between the aluminum watch casing and the stainless connectors on the band.<br /><br />I am receiving nothing but positive feedback from everyone who sees my watch with after market band. No one knows the difference."
Case fits fine but is very slick. Also slot in back is very hard to use.  Card falls out of slot.... Very touchy
"ok, im tired of all the reviews on youtube, and amazon saying that its the perfect sport headphones. im a person that works out alot. i purchase so many headphone for the gym. believe me this is not meant for working out. they say ti play with the ear wings and ear tips to get a perfect fit, but guess what i did, and nothing works for me. i even tried out after market ear tips and ear wings, and both was a failure. the problem is that its too big to put in your ears for sports activity. yes it might stay, but the eartips will pop out when your doing heavy activity like weight lifting. that means you loose music quality, and its annoying to readjust your headphone again and again when you sweat heavily during a good workout. yes the headphone will stay, but thats when your not active. the only thing that reviewers got right with this product is the sound quality, its the best i heard for bluetooth. they are not bad for regular use, but its just not for exercise"
"Cheap. There is no ballistic corner protection, don't be fooled."
"This case is awesome!  I wanted a hard case, with the same &#34;feel&#34; of the gameboy.  This one has it, and is very clean, and well made.  Great case!  I love it."
So very fast!!!!! Great iPhone case exactly what I wanted.
"It works great for music, but I can't get it to work so the other person can hear me on a phone call."
"It does what the description says but not really useful if you are the kind of person who likes to keep using the phone while charging. It does look fancy if it stays in your desk at work or at a living room. In addition, the max output current is lower than the first party charger that comes with the Nexus 5, that being said, it would take longer to fully charge if you use this."
I never heard about this company! My friend recommended me this devise because he using as well and is very satisfy from it. The conversation with this device is like a conversation with the person next to you!
"Was easy enough to apply, but is very soft.  Any scratches show.  After two weeks, I got a few scratches and dents and they are very obvious any &#34;self healing&#34; that has taken place is not effective enough."
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything.  I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken.  I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase."
This bike mount from Liger is better then I was expecting !  First I have to say I have a hard time finding products that fit my phone since my phone is a pretty big phone . I have a samsung galaxy mega and if anyone has this phone they phone its hard to find cases or mounts or other accessories for it . Well I was able to get the phone in this without any problem I didn't have to force it or anything . This Mounts to the bike very easy and I would say only after a few mins you are ready to go  Also once you get this into place it does stay in place ! You don't have to worry about it moving or falling off .  This is very stylish and made very well! Its made of strong materials and I feel that this can last a long time ! Overall opinion about this is its a very well made mount and it has exceeded my expectations for this completely<br /><br />I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion
Good case for price and for an 11 yr old boy.
This armband is listed for the iphone 6 plus but will work great with pretty much any large smartphone.  I own a 6 plus and a note 4 and both work flawlessly in this.  I like the finish of the material it has kind of a dry carbon look.  When going running I like wear bluetooth headphones but that requires me to bring my large phone with me.  This makes a perfect pair to wear this strapped to my arm to allow me to change my music on the fly on my morning jog. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who needs a sport arm band for their larger smartphone.  I was supplied this product in return for my honest and true review.
"As more and more newer computers start to include the new smaller USB-C ports we need a way to adapt our old USB devices so we can still use them.  This adapter works perfect for that.  Simply plug in your old standard USB device into this adapter then you can plug it in to a computer that has the newer type C port and still use your old devices on your newer computer.  I got the blue one and the black one.  They seem to be well made.  The ports on the adapter were tight so there was no sloppiness when using this.  I used an old usb flash drive and could access it just fine with this adapter, and it seemed to perform well.  I have attached some pictures of the adapters to this review for you to check out as well.  I am quite happy with these so far."
It fabulous. Only that the display writinga are smaller to see clearer. Good buy for me.
"Great cable, works fine art a great price."
"I have mixed emotions. Very sturdy and I appreciate real glass versus plastic as screen cover. Cons are that it is heavy and big, so much protection in muffles sound and dampens vibrate.  I like the fact it screws down. I'm hard on my phone and this protects it very well."
"Got this for my husband to use for work.  It was our family's first and LAST Windows phone.  Most of what he didn't like was Windows related.  After a few months he started having trouble charging the phone, or the phone would quickly loose its charge.  He switched back to Samsung S6 Android and loves that phone."
"RAVPower 2800mah supposedly provides an extra 200mah over a standard Samsung Galaxy S4 battery, but I've seen no practical difference between this product and a standard OEM battery. Nevertheless, the RAVPower works perfectly, providing good long life in my Galaxy S4. No problems. UPDATE! The battery recently began to swell. It's been two years, so I'm disappointed, but (I suppose) two years life for an inexpensive battery is not unreasonable. I've taken the defective battery out of service and have ordered a new RAVPOWER."
"Aukey 3-port usb charger arrived in a nice compact environmentally safe packaging box.  20AWG gauge 3.3ft cable was included, and the cable is a pure quality.  I just wish they would sell these cables separately, quality cable is very hard to come by.<br /><br />I have reviewed a number of multi-port usb chargers in the past, but none of them included QC2.0 quick charge port, so this is a big plus for this Aukey charger.  What is remarkable about this charger is a compact size with a folding AC plug - ideal for traveling.  With a size of about 2.75&#34; x 1.9&#34; x 1&#34; and a weight of only 85g, it has a footprint comparable to some single usb port travel chargers, but here you get 3 charging port with one being QC2.0.<br /><br />All ports combined could handle simultaneously up to 42W of power, with both regular ports being able to support 5V @2.4A and QC2.0 port supporting either 5V @2A, or 9V @2A, or 12V @1.5A.  Now if you do the math it means that you can run all 3 ports at the same time supplying the maximum current speed.  With many other multi-port chargers you can only run a few ports at max speed, while others share the remaining current load balance.  Here, there are no limitations.<br /><br />Under $23 with 18 months of dependable warranty and with a travel friendly footprint, this 3 port usb charger with QC2.0 built into one of the ports is a great product to consider when you are looking into a compact smart device charger."
"Couldn't get it to work with my Windows 7 laptop. Back of box states: compatible with Windows ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista. May be an older version. Update: It's possible I did not find the ON/OFF switch on the bottom of the pen; So, I'm not sure if it didn't work with my Windows 7 latptop or if it was operator error."
"I bought this for my LG G2 and it fits it quite well, even with a somewhat thick case on my phone. I'm very happy with my decision to get this mount, it's a lot more reliable than your typical magnetic car mount or anything like that. My only reservation is that after some fidgeting with my phone while it's on the mount (when the car is stopped, don't text and drive, folks!) the mount sometimes slips out of the vent and I have to push it back in. That's the only reason that I gave this four stars instead of five, but honestly it's not a huge deal. I'm still very happy with the car mount overall, and I think that it's less a fault of this mount specifically and more of the way that vent-based car mounts work in general."
"I love this case. It fits well, sturdy, and the color is beautiful. Would recommend this case to anyone.<br /><br />Received this product for review purpose but my opinions are my own."
"it sounds good for its size, this unit does not like the rain, as it stoped working when it got wet until it dryed out, and to me there is way to much wire, it took me forever to hide all of it"
"I've only had this case a month, maybe 2 and the flowers are already fading. Its pretty though"
front control panel broke in a week.wont recharge.NICE micro sd card that comes with this.. was good while it was working Volume gets 5 out of 10....playlist wasnt to flashy but still played music before it broke....this device does not  organize alphabetical order or numeric order type list you may have set up on pc to mp3.....was ok while it lasted but recomend you save up for something more durable and something that has HIGHER sound quality.
A.OK!
"I was given a CHOE Circle Qi Wireless Charging Pad to review and I must say that I am surprised. This simple, yet amazingly functional device makes my charging woes much easier. I have a Nexus 5 device that has built in wireless charging. Setup was super easy, literally just plug it in and that was it. To charge a device, whether it be my Moto 360 watch or my Nexus 5, all I had to do was set it on top of the charging pad. The LED light that the pad has is very useful in determining if the device is functioning or even charging. Highly recommended for those who want hassle-free charging for their Qi enabled devices."
"Haven't even had it a month and the camo is peeling off so going to have to order a new one really soon, I guess the protection factor is good but overall quality based on looks not so much!"
"Extra long, great quality, great purchase"
"I have ordered a few wallet cases for my iPhone 6+ and have hated every one but this one! It feels great, has held up to abuse, and works like a charm."
"this case i great you can drop your phone and nothing will happen and i know this from experience. it also has the stand that comes out on the back so you can just set your phone doen that's my favorite part because i hate holding my phone for example to watch youtube,netflic ext.. i highly recommend this phone case<br /><br />*i received this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review and this is 100% my own *"
"I love the case, but I gave it 4 stars because in two weeks the top cover began to chip."
Would not even turn on. Would not charge. Piece of crap. Returned it.
this works as a charger but when I plug my phone into my mac nothing happens??? i'm glad it charges and the length is great but i'm disappointed that this claims to be apple certified when it doesnt work.
"Skinomi Tech Glass met my expectation.  I've not installed a tempered glass before but I did a good job with Skinomi Tech Glass on my new Samsung Note 4 without any problem.  The clouding on the side for me after installation is not a problem after reading several reviews that it is common because Note 4 is not perfectly flat.  Now, I don't have to worry about scratches and cracks if ever."
I used this the weekend I received it - simple to use and worked wonderfully!
Works very nicely with my tablet.
It seems like it should work like the company has stated but we tried using it with the lanyard at first with fall detection on and it was constantly setting off the alarm when my wife would move just right or even setting down. We switched it to the wrist band and now it seems like it never goes off even with her having a fall the other night it didn't go off.
"Nice case, It;'s really well made with a perfect finish. It fits the iPhone 6+ perfectly. It's real wood , so it does add some bulky to the phone. Very cool different look, I get so many compliments when I'm using it. I just bought the iPhone and got the leather case as well so I've been switching between them. Love it!<br /><br />I received this a ta a discount in exchange for my honest review"
"You get what you pay for. It is a pretty nice, sturdy case. I am clumsy and have dropped my phone several times since I got the case and the screen has not cracked or shattered."
"The battery arrived on time and was packaged well.<br />The original battery in my Nokia Lumia 920 was started to have trouble holding a charge for one day, and that was with just using the phone as a phone, no music, video or internet use. I knew it needed a new battery so I took a chance on this one. The old battery had a 2012 date on it, and this new one had a 2013 date on it. Replacing the battery is fairly easy, but you need the right tools for it, which a friend supplied me with. I have charged it up fully and it is lasting much longer now, just like it did when the phone was brand new.<br />Hey, for the low price of this battery, it is worth it, even if it keeps my 920 working for another year I will be happy with that."
I just need to know if this item is suppose to have the led lights on when charging. I think my first one did and this one does not. It does charge my phone but it really runs the jackery down.
The use time is very good. I can get 8 to 10 hours of music time from this comfortable headset. Thank you.
Works great! Always on my wrist. Two interchangeable bands for those with larger wrists. Easy to sync to portable bluetooth device. I sync to both computer and android phone.
"I had great 30 days with the Battery, but it stopped working...... It says: invalid battery..... I am very disappointed with this... I really want my money back!"
Solid feel.  Precise in its accuracy.  The real test will come on game night and Jackbox is on!
"air bubbles in plastic cover obscure view & makes using while in armband difficult; case cord / button cutouts do not match up with iphone 6 plus; i.e., you have to remove from armband to charge & just make a guess as to volume up/down buttons as well as on/off button, also silence switch;<br />for those reasons I only give it a 3 rating, otherwise it gets the job done."
Extremely cheaply made.  Broke after having it for only a week.  Worse item I've ever bought on Amazon.
I have been using UPs since the very first one came out and was an epic fail. The way Jawbone handled that fiasco made me a customer for life.<br />As far as UP3 is concerned I'm still deciding. It appears to me that this band is tracking some of my driving and casual movements as STEPS. I also question the reliability of the resting heart rate. I'm in the mid fifties and average people are about 70?  Hmmmmm.<br />I also preferred the old band but I understand that Jawbone saves money with one size fits all.<br />The jury os out......
"Had it on my phone for a good half a year now and it's still holding strong after dropping my phone many, many times. Would recommend."
"A little larger than a portable external HDD, the Power Every Hour’s Dolphin 15000 mAh holds enough power to charge various smart phones 3.5 - 6 times depending on the model. It can charge my Galaxy S4 for over 4 times, and takes almost 2 hours from 10% - 100%, similar to the wall charger. The efficiency is about 75-80%. The battery bank itself recharges in about 11 hours. The outer build is plastic. It's small enough to fit in my jeans pocket. Together with the power bank I was provided with a battery survival guide eBook and VIP brand advocate membership, which I think is a very nice act from Power Every Hour.<br /><br />I performed some charging tests for efficiency of the power bank after I had received it.<br />CHARGING TESTS<br />Charging Phone (GS4 2600mAh battery, turned on):<br />- Charge 1: 2.4A 10% - 100% (1h 48m)<br />- Charge 2: 2.4A 10% - 100% (1h 52m)<br />- Charge 3: 2.1A 10% - 100% (1h 48m)<br />- Charge 4: 2.1A 10% - 100% (1h 48m)<br />- Charge 5: 2.1A 10% - 69% Ran out of battery<br /><br />Efficiency: 79.6% / 11940mAh used<br /><br />Charging Pack using GS4 wall charger: 11 and a half hours<br /><br />My first test yielded 75.8% / 11300mAh because I had left the pack sit for a couple weeks, and wasn’t precise with my measurements. The second test (above) showed better results. My setup is getting about 75-80% efficiency. This is good and you never get the full capacity because efficiency is always lost due to heat and other factors. The pack also stays cool while charging with only a few degrees increase above room temperature. It uses about 6.7 watts during most of its charge. It also charges my Bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />PROS<br />- 75-80% Efficiency<br />- Dual USB output<br />- Light weight<br />- Compatible with all USB devices including my Samsung and my wife’s iPhone<br /><br />CONS<br />- Would have been nice if the pack also features a charge indicator and flashlight. Currently, when it is charging it light up, but I would prefer to see the LED lights that tell me how much power it has left like other power banks I have: Pressing the button will light up each LED that corresponds with its charge %: 4 LED = 75-100%, 3 LED = 50-75%, 2 LED = 25-50%, 1 LED = &#60;25%. When charging the pack, it will show its current progress in a similar fashion until it shows all LEDs solid then off to indicate that it's fully charged.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />I am very impressed with this battery and its value. Its size is acceptable, the efficiency is good, the case and adaptors are a nice addition, and there is a longer-than-usual 18 month warranty. With over 4 charges to my phone, I can be away from a wall outlet for a few days or more. The only thing I would improve is to add an adaptor for the new iphones.<br />I also have the RAVPower 15000mAh Pack, and I can say that I like this one more, considering both the size and the efficiency. I ran test on the RAVPower and the best I could get from it was 75%; therefore, this one is slightly better and it weighs less.<br />I bought this product at a discounted rate in an exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I rate this product 4/5. If only it had the LED lights for indicator.efer to see the LED lights that tell me how much power it has left like other power banks I have: Pressing the button will light up each LED that corresponds with its charge %: 4 LED = 75-100%, 3 LED = 50-75%, 2 LED = 25-50%, 1 LED = &#60;25%.

Great little unit. It is accurate and handy. Fits in my pocket. Gives all the basics. Don't like having to remove batteries for recharging.<br />Lasts two rounds on one charge.
Great carry case for the Garman GPS Lots of room for extras too.
I read all the reviews and mostly were positive. But those that were negative talked about how the watch would not stay or charge on the stand. i purchased anyway and soon found the same issue - i could get it to stay on stand vertically but it would not consistently charge. They I realized I still had that thin peel off plastic protective cover on the white charger plate. I removed it and then everything worked perfectly.
"Brought this for. My new iPhone. I had one for my iPhone 5 that was perfect for quick runs to the store.  Held my phone and DL. This one won't stay closed, latch does not work. Already throw out packaging or would have sent back.  Paid too much for it"
I bought this so I wasn't attached to a wall outlet while  using and charging my electronics at the same time. Does it's job well.
"After about a year with my 5S, I noticed the battery life wasn't what it use to be. Thinking that it was simply an issue of an overused battery, I decided to replace it. What a mistake. This battery last a 1/3rd as long than the dying original i swapped it out for. Also, now if the battery gets close to 5%, the phone will just shut off.<br /><br />I would recommend taking your phone into the apple store and paying the premium to get the battery replaced with the OEM product."
"This simple case is Perfect in every way! It Protects, fits Note 3 exactly, feels wonderful to the touch, shade of pink is pearlescent and beautiful, kickstand easy to use and at the right angle. Highly recommend, very satisfied, not to mention the reasonable price!"
Awesome value for the price. Easily paired with my iPhone 5s. Great sound and they don't fall out of my sweaty ears when I run! Highly recommend. It's so awesome not having cords tugging at me anymore!
"Sound quality is worse than Apple ear plugs (one which comes with iPhone 5).<br />Money wasted, might not use it ever."
"Works okay. Ruined first one, so glad there were three. Couldn't get rid of all the bubbles"
"Very sleek, thin, classy, professional looking case!  The color is pretty and matches my iPad.  I ordered an $80 leather one, as well but I am happier with this case and returned the leather one.  It felt slippery the first few days but I got used to it and love it now!  Highly recommended!"
"The sound quality was the best of all my pieces. However, after a month of use it fell apart. The left ear piece came off and can not be fixed. The seller was responsive and replaced the broken set. So far I am happy with the new set."
Works great. Just what I wanted!
Nice heavy-duty cable.  More robust that Apple OEM.  Nice to have the extra length.
I really like this ChargerCity NonSkid Beanbag Friction Mount. I have a Garmin and this fits it very well. It is actually easier then the parts that come with the Garmin; It stays on the Dashboard without any problems. Also I like this better then the window stick part that came with the unit. I can keep the unit closer to me and its easier to see because of that.
This thing is a beast! A bit overrated as I'm sure it doesn't put out 3000 watts at 4ohm (I think it's 4ohm it says it puts out 3000) but it makes my Alpines slam hard! And it hasn't overheated at all! Sounds better than the $400 alpine amp my friend has pushing the same subs lol
Bought these for my wife who wanted a good wireless head phone for working out.  Read the reviews and found this product to be highly reviewed.  With in a couple months the right speaker has gone out.  Not very reliable.
"Very stylish phone case , but if you like girly cases I would not recommend this one, the back looks very pretty but when you look at the front of your phone it's just plain black."
"This radio does not make proper connections to the power supply. When wired according to the installation instructions, the radio is not controlled by the ignition switch. It always has power. If it were left turned on when the car was off (which seems likely), then it would run down the battery. An attempt was made to reverse the red (power controlled by the the ignition switch) and yellow (power always on for radio memory) connections into the radio. In this configuration, the radio was controlled by the ignition switch, but it reset and lost all settings whenever the car started. This inability to accept the proper power connections makes this radio of no useful value."
"I bought 2x of these selfie stick, one for me & a friend. Their very reliable and easy to use! Best thing it's wireless no issues so far, quite light and easy to store. Works with my S5 no Bluetooth issues, great!"
"The instructions on this are horrible, the 1st one the #1 wouldn't peal apart, then the 2nd time I got it to peal apart but because the instructions are WRONG I screwed it up, very disappointed ."
Don't be turned off by simple packaging upon receipt. You are getting a GREAT case for a small price - comparable to higher priced cases being sold at your local cell phone shop. The case fits S6 Edge Plus perfectly. It has a rubberized feel to the sides which provides for a good grip on phone & cut outs are a perfect fit. Shipping: Received very fast via PRIME! BTW -  I had to take my phone into Sprint store and the manager even said &#34;I really like this case.&#34; He thought I purchased it from their store - they offer something similar at 3x the price.
for the price it was a grate cheep starter kit for low wattage i am running a boss 1200 watt max but more like 300-400 rms it gets pretty hot but i have it in a bad spot and running it pretty decent everything you need comes with this kit tho the big connectors are junk small ones are pretty perfect size they should have just put more of them in the kit the fuse box is well it's not my first choice or top 5 id said probably 8 maybe kind difficult to use compared to my old one  zipties as you would expect are total junk as well but all the cable and wires are of good quality for the price
This stylus does not work well with my ipad. It seems to drag when I am touching the screen.  It should glide across the screen. One good thing the tip has not fallen out of the top.
"It's annoying to need to sync it manually every time. I keep forgetting. I rather lose my daily score than systematically open the app and sync the data. The main plus is water resistance. I swim wearing it all the time. The sport band is kinda weak - I lose the device time to time, so far in places it can easily be found in. I always worry about losing it in the water. Tried to play basketball wearing it in the sport band - keeps falling out on most soft fouls. Had to switch to the clip and wear it through the pocket. Still, you measure your movements one game or two, and stop wearing it at all - you can just guess it will be around 30-40% of daily goal, and you stop worrying about it.<br />I would love a device which would sync on its own, which could have woken me up in proper sleep phases, and was waterproof."
Not sure why but I expected this case to be a bit more heavy duty. But it fits perfect and looks super cute. Stand works great too it has an awesome locking thing on it. Only other downside is it arrived a day late. Probably not the sellers fault though.
"I'm so happy we went the blue case.  I really like the color of this Colleen cellphone case. It has a soft shell and than a harder she'll that goes over it. It also has a stand in the back to hold the phone up. It also comes with things to clean your phone before putting this case on. We had another case on his iPhone and it was big and bulky, this one is not. It is slender and sleek. I'm rating this a 4 because the rub part seems a little to flimsy but I'm not willing to throw my husbands phone down to test it out ;) we have little kids so we will know so enough if it holds up but I honestly says it's on my husbands phone and he will be using it for a while. He loves it! I received this product at a deep discount for my honest and unbiase opinion."
Clip broke and difficult to slide in and out of clip.
"April 2017 update:  WAS 5 stars. REMOVED 2 stars for adware.  Do a google search on &#34;fotaprovider com.adups.fota&#34; for more info.  To prevent the spying:<br /><br />1. Root the phone (I used the PC version of Kingo Root and connected my phone via USB).<br />2. Install Titanium Backup.<br />3. Using Titanium, search for &#34;adups&#34; (without quotes) in your list of installed apps.<br />4. Convert FotaProvider app to a user app within Titanium.<br />5. Uninstall FotaProvider using Titanium, and possibly the &#34;Wireless Update&#34; app. I uninstalled both.<br /><br />You will NOT be able to uninstall without rooting.<br /><br />Posh Mobile probably did not know about this issue when they sold the phones, and I still love the phone, but this spyware problem needs to be addressed.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />I bought this phone originally to use as a small media player but ended up getting phone service for it.  Pros and cons based on personal experiences are listed below. Overall I absolutely love this device and couldn't be happier with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- the price! The phone was priced at $30 when I bought it. It's very hard to get a decent no-contract unlocked Android phone at that price.<br />-- great size if you're looking for something small. I only know of one other type of Android phone that has a similar size but didn't like the appearance, and the OS version was older.<br />-- clean, minimal, slick appearance<br />-- although the resolution is low, the small screen size makes the resolution look decent. This isn't an ideal phone, however, for someone with very poor vision since the text is small. It can be increased, but since the phone size is small increasing the text size means fewer words on the screen.<br />-- great sound quality via headphones, and the sound output via the speakers was very loud given the size of the phone. A possible &#34;con&#34; is that the lowest volume setting above mute is still a bit loud, but some people might like that.<br />-- runs Android 4.4.2, which for my needs was just fine. I do not know if any version updates are planned, but there was a small OS patch available to download. The OS version after the patch was still 4.4.2. Phone service was not needed to get that patch.<br />-- zippy response time given the slower processor speed<br />-- runs streaming apps without any problems, including Spotify (had to use a version from a year ago to be able to sign in), Jango, and Pandora. I haven't tried any others.  Spotify music can be downloaded to the external SD card.<br />-- streaming videos work ok (only tried Netflix and YouTube) although it seems the frames per second is lower on this phone than with higher-end phones. If you only plan on using this for listening to videos you should be fine, but given the size and the noticeably slower FPS it's not the best phone for actively watching videos.  I did not try download any videos so I can only assume that works.<br />-- games work surprisingly well, although I only tried Angry Birds and Ball-Hop. I don't know if anything like Grand Theft Auto would work on this phone, nor do I know why you'd try.<br />-- apps CAN be installed to the SD card<br />-- works with 64gb cards (at least my card works fine, I'd think other 64gb cards would as well)<br />-- battery life. No it's not the greatest, but how much battery life can you expect in a phone of this size? The battery is small physically since the phone itself is small. I can go a day with light usage (web surfing, checking email, a little music streaming, etc.) and not run out of power.<br />-- very lightweight. I've had the phone for several days and still can't believe how light the thing is.<br />-- worked beautifully with a bluetooth keyboard (tried one made by Newtrent). I have not yet tried audio over BT.<br />-- FM radio, and I mean real FM, not an app that plays FM stations overan Internet connection. You'll need headphones however.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />-- keyboard usage is difficult, at least on the stock keyboard and the third party keyboard I installed, due to the small size of this phone, but this is understandable given how small the device is. I have relatively small fingers, so if you have big/fat fingers you might have a lot of problems entering the correct keys even with auto-correct. If you want a really small phone, you're going to get a really small keyboard.  Voice recognition works fine, so you can speak words instead of typing them out whenever the voice option is available.<br />- limited storage unless you use an SD card, although given the phone's price I think this is an understandable limitation<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- IMPORTANT: the phone uses a micro USB cable *BUT* it requires a cable with an extended tip. I tried many standard micro USB cables and in all but one the metallic tip wasn't long enough to charge the battery. In the one that did have a tip that was long enough, the connection was loose and I had to keep adjusting it to get it to charge. The cable that comes with the phone works great, including for transferring files, but if you lose that cable you might be out of luck. DO NOT LOSE THE CABLE THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE!!<br />-- outgoing phone sound can be slightly muffled (I only tried over AT&T and a wi-fi voip call), but spoken words are still understandable. Incoming audio was fine. If you want a phone for hours of talking, this probably isn't your best option<br />-- camera photos are low quality. They'll probably do fine in an emergency, such as an auto accident or something else where you have to take photos immediately, but otherwise you probably won't be using the camera. And there's no flash.an Internet connection.

"I've bought many lightning cables (probably close to twenty) over the past few years, and more than half of them have failed. Some failed due to obvious structural failure, and some just mysteriously stopped working properly. I've bought four of these Aduro cables and so far they are all performing well and still look close to new. I like that they have a lifetime warranty, although I haven't had to make any calls as of yet for a warranty claim."
Item description was very descriptive so I knew the car charger would be compatible with my cell phone before even ordering the item. Price was very fair. Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. Item works perfectly. Would gladly purchase from this seller again.
It fits well in my hand. Everything works as it should. I love this phone!
One broke the first day we used it. Buy a good cable don't waste your money.
Able to use my iPod classic with wireless sepaker now.  Great purchase!
"Great pair of earbuds, these have &#34;vacuum&#34; suction to give you more bass than normal earbuds plus they are wireless!  For the price you pay, you can't beat these and for globetrotters, these work well as the vacuum suction keeps pressure out and music in.  Better than my LG Tone+ at fractions of the cost."
Not a shallow mount<br />Incorrect specs
"It lasts about 6 weeks at most and I am careful and gentle with my new Iphone 6plus.<br />What happened twice to me with this case is the same thing. The first time I got it replaced for free but now I am out of the time frame to get it replaced or return it again. Here's what happens:<br /><br />The battery case has a contact point where it becomes the 'cradle' or charger for the iPhone. that contact point bends and stops connecting with the iPhone. So while I have a functioning battery case that charges, when I put the phone in the battery case it doesn't charge the phone. Therefore, it does no good. I can see that the battery case's contact point is bent and since it's the second time it's happened to me since getting it I know that it's not my fault but a manufacturer's defect in the battery case. I mine as well throw the battery case out bc it won't charge my phone, even though it is charged up itself from the wall charger."
"Not a protective case, for decorative purposes only."
DOA.  None of the cords (3-pack) worked.
"needed these, after original adhesive discs failed after a month.  Second set did the trick, glad I ordered them....."
"could be a little more protective, nice fit though"
Fast shipping! Perfect Fit!
"I thought I loved these, but they stopped working after 6 weeks.  They send a card and say contact them if any issues, but no actual way to contact them."
Work few days and connection got loose so not charing rapidly as my original charger that came with the phone.
"this case is an excellent addition to my phone. I had a few cases for this, but was looking for a case with a battery pack,powerbear is my solution, thanks guy."
Pros: The product sounds great while having a quality build. Volume control works on all headphones and has clip built in.  Cons: I'm 5'7&#34; with a short torso. My ears are small and they kept falling out of my ears. These are meant for larger ears. The headphone cable length is awkwardly short and needs to have the detachable volume control connected to fit in my pocket (even with a short torso). The waist clip is  at an awkward length of being too short and as well and might be used to clip onto a backpack strap or something higher.  Summary: This product is built well but not for people with small ears that want to work out at the gym. Volume control works really well with great sound but the audio cable is too short for me.
This is absolutely the best bluetooth headset that I've used. I would give it 5 stars but this is the third set I've had to buy. The wire on the left side has failed after a year on each of the first two. I would definitely buy them again.
"the case is very nice, but the screen protector was worthless. I threw it away, & will find anouther one."
"Overall good case, however, the really bad thing about is is the flap for the charger and headphone Jack. It doesn't close and I only have had the case for a day. Dissapointed"
I had the case for a month and I dropped the phone one time and it cracked.  I was very disappointed becuase my family members have this case and drop there phones all the time and mine broke don't know if it was a defective case all I know is it cracked.
Fits the iPhone 6 very well! I've dropped it a couple of times and the case protected the phone very well!
Sat<br /><br />Satisfy with it.
"So far the most durable and &#34;better&#34; size cases for iphone 5s I have tested. I also tried otterbox like cases before but they are too big that defeats the purpose of slim iphone design. I like this case for two things, durability and strength."
Good quality construction.  Should outlast the charging cord provided by Apple and even some of the other aftermarket cords.
I chucked those leashes but the stylus is comfortable to use (unlike the garbage one they sold me at Verizon) and works well on my Moto Turbo.  The package of three allows me to scatter them around for easy access at the places where I typically use them.
"Be careful, my phone just updated its cyanogen operating system and, now, the microphone doesn't work except on speaker phone.  People can hear me but have no idea what I'm saying unless it is on speaker phone.  In their forums I've found they've had this problem for about a year with various versions of their operating system.  I just went to the oneplus site and it's down, maybe this bug infected every phone with this last upgrade. I got the phone in April and it wouldn't work with my car's bluetooth for a couple of months, it would stop, make a clunk sound and buffer for 5 seconds then play music for 20 seconds over and over.  It works now using my car as a bluetooth speaker but the controls only work on the phone.  My old nexus 5 would play music in my car by bluetooth using the car's controls but this phone still can't do that.  It tries but the buttons, such as the play triangle on my car's touchscreen, do not respond and the album covers are blank whereas our other phones interact perfectly with the car (a 2014 toyota). One other thing, I can't look now since their site is down but my recollection from when I had the blue tooth problem is that they do not have customer service, they route you to forums populated by people who's hobby is rooting their phone then thrashing about until one of them stumbles on a kludge that makes them work again until they damage them again... . It's not much help at all and it is definitely not customer service."
"I think the triangular arm is a little small. I think for a case this height, it needs to be made of something more substantial than plastic. The phone itself is kind of heavy, so one little tip on the screen sends it falling backward. Basically, you can't stand it upright and also swipe or tap on the phone because it will fall over."
"Only one complaint, it goes to another language when you hold in the button. Other than that, no other complaints."
Works  perfectly. Only thing I don't like is the screw. It'll cross thread to easy
"fits well, light weight and thin but still gives the amount of protection we needed.  Exactly the product we wanted at a very reasonable price"
"Spigen makes EXCELLENT cases. This in particular is no exception, great protection for the Nexus 5, easy to get use to it."
"Day 1 - the product is working well in my Honda Odyssey 2014 with Rear Entertainment System.  I am using with an iPad 1 which I loaded up with movies.  I had to jail break the iPad with the Absinthe software which was free and not too difficult.  Then I found an app in the Cydia app store called &#34;Resupported 4.0+&#34; which allows you to use the cable and Honda Entertainment System without getting the message, &#34;This is an unsupported apple device&#34;.  The app runs about $4.  Now all our movies played from the iPad run in the Van.  Great for long trips.  My only complaint on this cable is that it took about 3 weeks for it to arrive.  Also, it would be nice to have been apple certified but that is why this is so cheep.  Will update this post later if cable doesn't last."
"This armband runs a little large, and I think it is not as useful for women who have smaller arms."
Plastic was too hard on the face and couldn't get it to work for me. I probably should have returned it.
"Very disappointed in this product. My son got it on for me, was hopeful it would workout, went to use my phone and people I talked to said my voice was very hard to understand, It sounded horrible.  I had already thrown the packaging away so I did not try to return it at this point.  I'm guessing that is why the product was discontinued"
"i have had this phone for not even a year and its already not working. it just wont turn on anymore, I've charged if for hours at a time and it still wont turn on, this is the second of four BLU phones i have bought and they have all had problems, i will not be buying a BLU phone anytime soon."
Works as advertised with zero issues. I have used all 6 ports at the same time and it does get a little warm but nothing that has ever concerned me.
"Great item, works as advertised. Yes, I would purchase this item again if needed."
works right in the cd slot and swivels 360 degrees I love it
This is perfect for charging your cell phone. We are going to order another one for the bedroom.
My case is exactly what I wanted very durable and all of the buttons/speaker work just perfect through the case And not to mention I love the color!
Great headset for jogging.  The earbuds fit comfortably in my ear and do not fall out even after wet with sweat.  Freedom of movement was good too with plenty of cable from the neckband to my earbuds to swing my head from side to side.  Highly recommend.
"This is a very nice case. The back of the case can hold lost of items. The only thing I don't really like about the case is that there is no lip or anything on the front. So the front of the case is right in line with the front of your phone, so it doesn't provide your screen much protection.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Excellent product. The two-piece case fit my Moto G 2nd Gen perfectly. The third part, the outer kick-stand / belt clip hold is just useless for me. I tried it over and over, but it is WAY too tight for practical use. It literally clings to the phone, you have to fight to get it in or out of the holder. Which has caused me to drop the phone a couple time. - BUT the excellent case protected it - as it always does.  (On the plus side - If you do get your phone into the belt clip you sure don't have to worry it will fall out - it won't - without a fight.)  The case has a nice touch and feel, not slippery. I've been using about over 3 months, dropped it on cement floor about 12 times, and it just bounced and protected my Moto G 2nd gen.  Option to have stand work on just the inner shell or with the outer belt clip (One reviewer confused the two, he thinks you are supposed to be able to put on belt clip AND the inner shell and have the belt clip stand work. It does not work that way, when in the belt clip it is designed to protect your screen and avoid prying eyes from seeing your screen, and to stop errors from butt (belt ?) dialing.  I bought this to give me a belt clip:   It fits my Moto G 2nd Gen perfectly WITH this Fosmon 2-Piece case installed on phone: iPhone 6S PLUS , 6 PLUS {5.5'' version} AIScell Extra Large Ultra Rugged Pouch Case Holster Black Nylon Canvas Velcro Flap with Steel Metal Belt Clip + Carabiner Hook + Cleaning Cloth http://www.amazon.com/AIScell-Carabiner-LIFEPROOF-WATERPROOF-protective/dp/B00NKA4NQY"
"The company that makes these, sent me a free pair to try, probably because I have a lot of headphones and ear buds.<br />I run cross country, do a lot of hiking, and work in my wood lot about 40 days per year.  Working in timber is hard on ear buds because of snags, but I love my music, and hate terrible-sounding buds or those that don't seal right. The answer for me has been cheap ones from China.  These in particular fit the bill because (besides being inexpensive):<br />1.  The sound is nice and flat across the highs and lows. If you want a more bass-heavy sound you can press both volume buttons down until you hear a beep, which selects one of (as far as I could discern) three preset EQ profiles.<br />2.  I get a good seal from this design. Some Bluetooth earbuds aren't built for my ears, but these are.  in my experience, the thing to look for in pictures is a nice, long &#34;stick-out&#34; between the bud and the housing that holds the electronics.<br />3.  Easy, no code pairing. I use an iPhone, so your mileage may vary, but these hook up when selected from the new device list with no code required. I hate rooting through the manual to find a code, especially when it ends up being 0000 or 1000 or similar.<br />These do have a few things that you might have a problem with, or that I didn't test:<br />1.  You have to have good feeling in your fingers to operate some of the special functions (skip fed or back, vol up or vol down) because the controls are mounted in the earpiece rather than on the neck cord where you can see them. Call answering, pause, play, re-dial, off, and on are less impacted because they are accessed through a the giant green logo button.<br />2.  The mic is in the earpiece like a Bluetooth phone headset. This is a feature that I don't care about, dint use, and didn't test because I use these when I don't want to take calls. It probably works fine, but I didn't check it."
"I have dropped my phone a million times on concrete, asphalt, tile, etc and my phone is still protected. I recently noticed a crack on the case! Great case"
I couldn't get the front glass off with the tool in the package. I ended up having to take it somewhere to have it repaired
"This phone case was just what I was looking for! I like the weight of it and the nice design. It was easy to put on my phone with 6 small screws. The phone is covered by a rubber case, then the metal case is screwed together around it. But the rubber sticks out around the sides  making it easy to grip. And it comes with a built in tempered glass screen cover which is really nice except it makes it very hard to make the touch screen work. anything above the center of the screen wont work unless i touch to the very right side with the lock screen on. So that is really irritating.<br />It is a nice case but I will probably try to remove the screen protector and put  my own on my phone.<br /><br />I did receive this phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. This did not sway my opinion in anyway."
lightning charges for my LG G4
It lit up but it doesn't even WORK!!! But the lights are pretty. Wouldn't order another one.
Favorite case for the ONE.
Im only giving one star because the screen protectors were horribly cut
"This is the perfect phone carrier. Even going over rough patches of road, I never have any doubts about the phone being secure. The straps are unobtrusive and leaves plenty of room to interact with the phone. Set up was really easy and took 2-3 minutes."
"Hey these ARE the real deal, and the case is nice. (I still prefer the Apple EarPods to most others anyway.)"
"[[VIDEOID:15310c2914134a2ab394df8676e24da2]] I purchased the Gopro camera accessory kit as a gift for my sister, who received a GoPro for Christmas last year. The kit arrived perfectly packaged into a carrying case, everything protected by foam and plastic. I took it to her the other day as a housewarming gift (it's something she's been wanting!) and we tested all of the pieces to make sure everything fits. This kit made a great gift and she was so excited to start using the different accessories. I am also adding a video review to show a few of our favorites. Everything is well made and fits the go pro perfectly. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
Exactly as it looks online. My boyfriend has had the black one for a year and it still looks great!
"I have bought 5 iPhone cases in the last month, this is the ONLY one that I have been absolutely in love with.  The bottom comes off so you can use it in an iHome, there is bumper protection for the screen, the holes on the bottom for charger  & earbuds are the correct size (I had one case you couldn't even charge w/o taking the case off) The holes are in the right places for the microphone & speakers (I had one case where nobody could hear me because the case covered the microphone!) This one is perfect, plus the gold & salmon colors are stylish and vibrant. This is definitely the way to go!"
This is a fantastic hands free piece. Even if you have a case on your phone you can use this.  It comes with extra magnetic inserts you put into the case as well as a 3M piece for when your phone is not encased.
Had this case for a few months. Love(d) the feel and thinness. BUT the plastic on the bottom is thin around the openings and easily broke under normal use.
"Fits perfectly around my iPhone 6 life proof case and came is 2 days of ordering! And the material is soft, so it doesn't scratch my arm like my last arm band did."
It is good to have a backup charger....the older style chargers do not charge well for the Note 3.
"The Celltronix 2200 mAh Portable Battery Backup Charger is a good emergency backup battery (or great for those with an older phone battery that can't seem to make it through a heavy day of usage, like mine).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-compact (roughly the size of half a candy bar)<br />-seems very durable with a rubberized exterior, my toddler got ahold of it and chewed on it for a while, and neither the battery nor the child are the worse for wear<br />-easy to use<br />-attractive red color<br />-includes LED flashlight<br />-enough juice for a full charge on my iPhone 5S<br /><br />Cons:<br />-According to the print on the charger, &#34;2 click for light&#34;, I should be able to push the power button twice in rapid succession to turn on the LED flashlight.  This works, sometimes.  Other times it arbitrarily doesn't.  This is a minor annoyance but I don't really use it for the flashlight much.<br />-It did NOT come with any instructions.  Using these chargers is fairly simple, but it should at least include some brief instructions on the box.  Plug it in until fully charged.  Plug in your desired USB charge cable (not included).  Press power button once to begin charging.  To stop charging your phone, hold down the power button until the indicator lights turn off.<br />-I actually don't mind the short USB cable included to charge this device, but it may be too short for some people<br />-note: this does not include the phone cable that you will need to connect it to your phone (unless your phone charges on micro USB). This is normal for most chargers though, so I'm definitely not counting this against it.<br />-FYI, this will not charge the iPad 2 or other devices that require a higher powered USB charge (but the product description doesn't claim it does, so not counting against it)<br /><br />This is a good device, though not of the same polish and overall quality as the other chargers I've evaluated at a similar price point.  If I needed to buy a new charger, all else being equal, this isn't the one I would pick.  However, it certainly gets the job done.  If it were in a lower price bracket I would give it a solid five stars.  However, for the price, I expected a bit more polish.<br /><br />I received a free sample of this product in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

Bought this for my iPhone 6 and it was easy to install and had a great fit. I have dropped my phone a few times already from 2-4 ft off the ground and it has provided solid protection.  No cracks or scratches on the phone.
Great.fast shipping
"Sturdy  Really needed a new case, and it seems this was a good choice"
"&#34;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest&#34;<br /><br />This thing is awesome, charges my devices quickly and is nice and compact. Best travel charger and home charger I've used in awhile. Definitely would recommend."
Just what everyone needs that has to use their phone constantly. Compatible with apple with not reject message. Delivered super quick too
"Best case on the market! And an even better company to stand behind it! This screen protector does its job without any distortion to the picture quality. Additionally, when the corners of the protector began to bubble after one hard fall, Tech Armor sent out a new protector immediately with zero hassle. Replacement was extremely easy with no residue left on the phone from the old protector. Would never buy another brand of screen protector! Thank you Tech Armor!"
"Very good product. Super satisfied.<br />Excellent quality and extremely easy to install.<br />Giving the fact I am not really good at going back and posting reviews, this specific time I had to."
Overall Great case.  The small covers over sine of the plugs could be better.
this product brings the Spanish language in their native language menu as reported in its publication smartphones were required to Venezuela<br />Cheers...
I bought this case for my teenage daughter. She and everyone loves the design. She gets so many compliments.  It's  a slim design but a protective  one. All buttons line up and are functional.
"Poor Quality.  Love the look.  Price is great.  The 1st or 2nd time I dropped it, the 2 corners broke.  The phone was undamaged thankfully.  Maybe you won't be a clumsy as me!"
My box came with multiple tears in the fabric. I am not pleased with the quality of this box. 1 star. Don't purchase this box.
"I received the phone yesterday and it seemed great.  The build quality / fit and finish are great.  The phone seems responsive.  However, the rear facing camera does not work.  accessing the camera says, &#34;Something went wrong&#34;.  I tried a hard / soft reset, updating all the apps from the windows store.  Checked for OTA updates, etc.  A bit of research on the internet shows this is quite a common problem, with no resolution other than sending it back to the factory.  Since this is an international phone and getting warranty in the US is impossible, it will be going back to amazon.  I am very disappointed, as I like the size and weight of the phone.<br /><br />If you can live without the rear camera"
"Today I pulled the classic &#34;Coffee on the roof of my car&#34; stunt and completely forgot that I had put my phone (in this case) on the trunk of my car. I drove off and thanks to the rubber backing, it stuck to my trunk until I reached about 45-50mph. I saw it fly off my car in my rear view mirror. The case came off on the first bounce, but that protection from the initial impact is what saved my phone.<br /><br />The glass is busted, but IT STILL WORKS! Including the touch screen. I couldn't believe it. I don't usually leave reviews, but after what happened today, I need to vouch for this case. You don't get much more of a crash test than the stunt that I just pulled! This case will protect your phone!"
Very portable. Use it on my boat and TV with my unite pro hotspot.  Gives you about one or two bars signal strength improvement.
Fit was perfect in my 2005 ford Explorer. No modifications required. I could not use the lower mounting bracket  with the Pioneer radio I purchased but the radio was very secure without it.
"When I first got this unit, I was excited. It had mostly positive reviews, and given the low cost, I thought I'd give it a try. First issue was the car charger was working intermittently. So I ended up using my own charger from an old cell phone. To their credit. the seller offered a partial refund due to the faulty charger.<br /><br />Fast forward to the summer, when a week ago I reviewed some video and noticed it was blurry and out of focus. Thinking the lens, or my window might be dirty, I cleaned both. However this wasn't the issue- the video was still blurry. After some online research, it seems a certain amount of other users of this device have the same issue due to the plastic warping in the heat.<br /><br />For a unit that is designed to be placed in a car windshield, this is not acceptable. The unit is permanently ruined, as all video images are now blurry, and I'm now four months past the return date, so I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Great size and form factor. The small 'wedge' shape was ideal over most of the other dash cams, which hang from suction cups.<br />-Decent quality video for a camera in this price range (while it lasted)<br />-Seller was good about reimbursing me for faulty car charger<br /><br />CONS<br />-Unit made entirely of plastic (not a good idea for lens and lens housing, which should be glass and metal)<br />-No way to refocus lens. It is permanently fixed in position.<br />-If you live in Florida, or other hot areas of the country, think twice before choosing this unit."
Very pleased. The Opti line of lanzar is one of the best bang for buck ever. I have two products from them are both are excellent. About to buy something else from them too
This works great! Installed on 1995 E320.  Had it working in about an hour. Will buy again for customer cars.  Need to find out if there are any settings for vacuum door locks.  I need to extend the pulse. The instructions included worked fine for me.  The actual wiring of just the push button start is easy.  Hooking up door locks and all the other extras is a bit harder and time consuming as with all installs.
I have had two of these over a year and they have proven very reliable.  One feature they have that some other recharger/battery packs don't is that they can provide power while they are being recharged.  I have actually used these as battery-backed continuous power sources for USB-powered gizmos like clocks by using this feature.
Doesn't stay charged to long and volume is to low your money is better spent else were
"I expected a cheap mid range phone for the price and instead I got an impressive machine that has done everything I've asked. The only two cons: 3.5mm headphone jack is lower quality than most, so headphones are restricted on volume level. Workaround, use Bluetooth headphones, no restrictions. Second issue is no notification lights. Workaround, download a notification light app.<br /><br />I'm still amazed that from 5% battery, I was able to charge the phone to 100% in 15 minutes! I used the cord the phone came with. Every app has worked with the phone so far and after a quick charge, phone lasts 8 hours with HEAVY usage. Without, much longer. Seriously who cares how long it lasts when it charges in 15 minutes?"
Great to have these around. For some reason this is the only style I like. Thanks for having them available.
"I ended up completely undoing the KnuKoncepts 8 gauge amp kit I initially wired in my car (that was not fun) & using this kit instead. The quality difference is night & day btw the two kits and as of this writing it only cost $30 which is a steal for what you get. Moreover, the wires come w/ terminals preinstalled and the fit perfectly over my 15 Camry's battery terminal.<br /><br />The craftsmanship that went into the design of the 50amp fuse box that comes w/ this kit alone justifies it's asking price. (which is a steal as a similar kit @ BestBut cost $80). I used this kit to wire my Alpine MRV-F300 amp & all the wires fit perfectly w/ no modification needed (expect stripping the ends to fit into the amp's terminals).<br /><br />Please don't waste your time with the &#34;KnuKoncepts&#34; amp kit. The 8 gauge wiring is some of the cheapest I have seen although it is in a very &#34;pretty&#34; package (I am referring to the nice exterior insulator). I used everything from an Auto wire stripper to a utility knife (carefully) but the wires broke so easily.<br /><br />I have attached photos conveying the quality difference..."
"Rather than making my whole phone bigger this time, I thought I would try using an extra battery.. So far so good and it charges in a heartbeat."
"Bought it for my Nuvi 2699.  Fits this odd-size (6&#34;) Nuvi.  Solid enough to protect in normal handling, storing under the seat, etc.  A bit too flexible for say luggage handlers."
"Super adorable and fits my phone well. If you are looking for a protective case this isn't the case for you, but in my case I just wanted a slim case that would look good with my phone. It looks amazing!!!"
"I like the fit, keeps the nice slim features of the phone. The problem is the opening for the charger, it's a really tight fit and it catches the sides every time I charge it. Seems like over time it will crack from the constant plugging and unplugging. This is the original charger that came with the phone."
"I did not enjoy the skin I have a armor suit skin for my Pebble watch and it is great i love it the but this kit for the note 5 was terrible the side strips aren't even the right length,  no matter how hard I tried I could not get it to be bubble free and good looking without the risk of soaking my phone with the solution so I ended up throwing the whole kit in the recycle bin waste of about 11 bucks"
Simple nice case.  I don't carry cards in it but I like the flip case.  Fits my iPhone 5s perfect.
Really wanted this cellphone but it didn't do what I needed most. I wanted to use it on my Wi-Fi. It would see my network and log on then lose the signal within 15 seconds. Would never remember the password either and I was only 30 inches from the Wi-Fi . My old Samsung works ok with it .Sent it back already . Could have been a bad phone but Ill try another brand this time.
Won't hold heavy iPhone 6 plus steady. Slides back in too easily.
"Say you're hanging out with friends outside and you know that your phone is getting low, that's a great moment to have this. I give this product an overall 5 stars."
Bought these for my boat. These rock!! I would recommend them to anyone. Had them now for 3 weeks and still sound great!
Works great!  Have no problems charger my iPad and phone at the same time.
Worked as advertised with ease! Shipped promptly. Great price!
"I like the Square Trade plans, and have used them on multiple devices in the past.  After a horrible experience with the warranty through my cell phone provider (it doesn't matter which one - they ALL use the same company) I realized it was much less expensive to get my own insurance and dump their plan.  I've had the unfortunate opportunity to test out the warranty, and have some feedback.  First, they won't have new phones in stock.  It took at least 5 days to get a replacement, not 2 days.  Disappointing, but not too much different than going to your provider.  In my case, my provider could have replaced it in 3 days.<br />Square Trade does have a deductible you'll have to pay in addition to the cost of the plan, but it's also less than the deductible through the cell provider's insurance company.<br />Not perfect, but better than your average cell phone accident plan."
"Great case at this price. Fits perfectly, great grip. Looks good. Only negative because the buttons at the side are fully enclosed, it is harder to activate them."
"This thing has changed the way I use my phone, believe it or not.<br /><br />I used to never charge my phone (Nexus 6), I am in and out of my chair at work so often that plugging my phone in and unplugging it became a chore. &#34;What, you lazy $#$@&#34; you say? My phone protective case makes it very difficult to plug in, when your boss says &#34;everyone in the conference room, now!&#34; you don't have time to yank it - but you need your calendar and work email.<br /><br />The Itian fixes all of this. When I sit down, I just set my phone down. When I get up, I just grab it. Literally 0 thought. My phone is almost always topped off now when I leave my desk, and the base also raises it so I can see the screen for alerts etc.<br /><br />It is NOT magnetic, which kind of sucks coming from the Nexus 5 and it's magnetic charging basestand. But meh I guess."
I've used Diztronic cases for years. They offer great protection at a great price and the customer service is second to none. I confidently recommend these cases to anyone who asks for a recommendation.
The zenwatch is good looking and serve its purpose as a smartwatch. Battery life lasts about 2 days. Easy to use and the watch band can be easily changed.
"For starters, I do not have the comparable Apple branded keyboard to compare this to.  Also, while I type a ton, I'm not a keyboard enthusiast.  I just want something that types well.  As a keyboard, it's okay.  The finish fits well with the overall Apple finish, it's compact, portable, and easily moved around my desk.  I believe the keys are the same size and layout as the keys on my MacBook Pro (2013), so it's seamless going from one to the other.  The battery holder adds just the right amount of tilt.<br /><br />The finish is consistent with its price.  It is plastic and it feels plasticy.  The keys are a bit &#34;clacky&#34; and louder than on my MacBook.  The biggest con, though, is that it periodically disconnects and has to reestablish the connection.  I assume this is some sort of an energy saving feature, but it seems to happen very quickly after I stop typing.  If I'm typing in a document, flip over to my browser to skim through a source and come back a minute later, the keyboard has often disconnected.  It takes about 5 second to reconnect.  Not the end of the world, but it gets annoying to think you've typed out half a sentence only to have to pause and restart.  I don't have an Apple keyboard, so I can't say whether that happens with the real McCoy as well and, if so, whether the delay is as bad.  Some other reviewer probably has, so look for that before you buy.<br /><br />Overall:  This is okay.  Good for its price -- and better than a bunch of the clunkier cheap keyboards out there if you want to mimick the Apple aesthetic.  If I were buying again, I would probably suck it up an pay for the Apple version since I use it 6-10 hours a day if I'm working from home."
"This power bank is a literal gem. It has plugs for my old iPhone--which still has photos on it--plus it works with my new Amazon Fire phone and my AT&T wi-fi device. I like that everything fits right into the device so there are no loose cords anywhere when you're not using it. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, and I love it. It's a good buy even at full price, plus it's nicely portable."
"As soon as i plugged it to the wall, the light came on for ten mins and than it stopped working."
"Great piece of glass, very smooth and leaves my phone feeling responsive. The professional look of it gives the illusion it was built on the phone."
It's not a real Kate Spade case and I was very disappointed
"This stuff is so much thicker than Dynamat!  Installation wasn't bad, but I've watched dozens of YouTube videos before starting the project.  The road noise, especially in town, is so much quieter.  I bought new speakers to replace my factories, but I noticed a big improvement on sound quality simply from applying the Ballistic.  Music is more crisp, bass response is SO MUCH BETTER, and there are no more annoying buzzes or rattles coming from inside the cab.  When talking on my Bluetooth, there is no background noise.  I've also noticed the cab being cooler since I've applied the Ballistic.  I used 2 bulk packs for my 2011 Chevy Crew Cab, and completely covered all 4 doors, the rear floor, and had some left over."
I started using this a month after purchase. It worked for a month and suddenly stopped working. I wonder every one is facing same issue. I liked the cable and the length but only if it works.
"the phone works fine ,but the charger did not work ,i ll buy another one."
"The plastic is thick and appears durable. Part of me is hesitant to rely on an inexpensive case like this for my very expensive phone, but I tested it out with a paper towel, submersed in water, and it held up just fine. Then, I took the phone into the swimming pool and got some really cute under-water pictures of my swimming kids! I'm pretty impressed. Only draw-back is that with the iPhone 6 Plus, you need to maneuver the phone just a little bit, so that the camera isn't obstructed by the opaque colored plastic. But, that's not so hard. A bigger problem is that the touch-screen seems to be thrown off by the conductive water (not the case's fault, but the water itself). I highly recommend this, and have already done to so my friends and family."
Arrived really quick!  Just as advertised - and it does a really good job of charging several items.  My other single USB wall ports that came with their electronics sometimes got quite warm or even HOT and occasionally shut off because of the heat and often took a long time to charge the unit.  This one works on several units at a time and does NOT get hot (or even warm).  It also charges my units MUCH faster than the the OEM's.  This is a really good powerport!
"It was cute,  but the edges around the buttons broke the same day I put it on my mobile and it kept pooping off."
"The photo is deceptive, showing the case going on the front of the phone...needs clarification."
"Ordered this as a replacement cable since we've had good luck with the durability of Belkin cables in the past, but the wrong cable is inside the box. Ordered the 90 degree cable, and two times in a row now, a regular straight lightning cable showed up. This is obviously an issue on Belkin's end, and Amazon customer service took care of me, but I'd be wary before ordering one. Maybe it's just me and my luck! I have no doubt the cable is probably a good cable, if you get the one you asked for."
Was good for a few times but I then it started to leak water in. I would test water resistance first before you risk your iphone
"work for 3 days, called vender they replaced it, that one worked for 2 weeks  and that one wont work either,  very poor quality and hard to take out of case, also it wont charge both together phone and case"
"In about six months, this case on my LG G3 developed cracks from both top corners (and I did not drop the phone once). One crack goes most of the way towards the camera/button opening. I tried contacting Incipio for a warranty replacement (the box says it has a &#34;one year guarantee&#34;), filling out the RMA form on their website as well as emailing support, and neither got anything more than an auto-reponse after two weeks.  Nice case for six months, but don't expect the company to honor their guarantee."
This is a cheap China knockoff.  The black plastic exterior piece is too small to cover the factory antenna hole.  The angled base plate is not at enough angle so the antenna sticks out at a 5-10 degree angle.  The plug doesn't fit into the radio antenna extension.  The cosmetic hardware chips and scratches even when installed very carefully.  There aren't even any instructions included and this is not direct replacement.  Avoid this piece of junk.
Very stylish looking device. I think it is very useful for streaming Spotify and Pandora which works using Pandora and Spotify software. I have been using it with double twist app over my Android device through the DLNA connection. It doesn't come with software for direct streaming of your music on your device so you have to use a third party app to do this. DoubleTwist is working well for this purpose and I had already downloaded it in order to use airplay on it over my Apple TV. It does use high quality components and sounds great over my stereo system and to my ears sounds better than the Logitech bluetooth adapter I have used over the same system.
"The material is very cheap looking and feeling.  Comes with terrible smell that will probably go away in few days.  I was able to operate touch screen just with my finger w/out any issue unlike some of the reviewers had complained about here.  I guess I got what I paid for.  Even so, I feel this item should be even a few dollars cheaper."
"Exactly what I wanted, an excellent product."
Very good case for the money. Fits ice and snug and has a great sticky grip to it. I would order again if need be.
Pros - easy to apply<br />Cons - Anti fingerprint does not work
"UPDATE: 9/5/2016<br />I'm still using this case and it still looks and works great!<br /><br />I really like the look and feel of this case.  Other leather cases I've had try to form the leather around the edges and corners of the iphone and it never quite works.  The designers of this one went another way: they shaped a light brown frame of plastic around the corners and edges and then attached a contrasting piece of leather to the frame.  It works better and looks better, too.  It has a leather cover that secures with a magnet.  This is the part I like the least - I prefer a snap.  Snaps tend to secure the flap better, but that's just a nitpick. This is a fine case for a nice price!<br /><br />PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.  This item was provided for review consideration.<br /><br />Cheers! Claire"
"There are numerous highly technical review on products, however the vast majority of people are like me more in the novice category and would appreciate a review geared to my level of expertise.  So here it is!<br />This works well, holds a charge for several days without loosing very much power and will charge your cell phones, tablets, etc.  about as quickly as a normal electrical connected charger.  How much power is expended in charging your things is largely dependent on what you are charging.  It takes more to charge my tablet than my phone.  However I listen to books a lot on my phone and need it charged more frequently, so I end up using this more often.<br />It is bigger and heavier, but the size seems to be a function of how quickly it charges and how many charges you can use before it is empty.  I keep a small velcro strap with my external charger so I can &#34;tie&#34; the device to the charger.  Otherwise if I have it charging while in my purse or backpack, it seems to come easily disconnected.  I also have pouches that both this and my cell phone will fit in together and prevent disconnecting while in motion.<br />If you need to hold this while mobile and don't carry a medium or large sized bag, I would recommend getting the smaller portable charger.  It won't  charge as many things, but you have to compromise with ease of use vs. charging ability, that may be the better route to go.<br />There is a new version of this device out, so you should be able to get this one for a reduced price.  It will come up as a special value in order to clear out old inventory in all likelihood which gives you the biggest discount usually.<br />The flashlight is brighter than you would expect from such a small device, but I have yet to find a need for it.  Kids love to play with it however!<br />Avoid the &#34;pretty&#34; and the &#34;cute&#34; external portable chargers which you see in the check out lane in lots of stores.  They tend to be junk.  If something is too cheap there is usually a reason for it.  This one looks like what it is, a work horse.<br />It comes with a little pouch which keeps it clean if you are carrying it in your bag as well as making sure the cord is always handy.heap there is usually a reason for it.

"I bought this and I kid you not the left ear piece broke off in a day. I had it in my ear and pulled it out, and it broke. It's an astetically pleasing product but didn't go the distance."
They work well....def not as fast of a charge like the wire that came w the phone but as a back up it works.
"For the money, you can't beat these. Nice and loud, not a lot of bass, but they are very affordable. I did have to enlarge my holes just a bit; I'm not sure I measured what I had right. I've had them about 4 months now, no issues.Fixing to buy some more to add to the front as the two in the back are the only speakers this boat had, so I'm going to add two more in front."
Would not charge after 30 days.  Buyer beware
Excellent! Used twizzers to avoid fingerprints. Great protection for my HR :)
Great product better than the one that came with my phone
"The product arrived in good condition and arrived quickly. My Samsung S4 fit the shell, but the phone and shell don't stay in the holster. So far today the phone has fallen out 3 times.  I will order a different shell and holster and throw this one away."
"The concept behind the watch is excellent. I love it. If you're not a runner, you might find it unsatisfying however.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of modes to learn. It hones in on tracking number of steps in a day. When you go for a run, the step tracker operates in the background while the stopwatch, heartrate monitor and calorie tracker take over. When you're done for your run, the step tracker becomes primary again, having added the steps from your run to the daily total.<br /><br />But now we come to the software, which is unfortunately seemingly yet another case of software designers who don't know squat about the thing they're writing the software for. It's not the worst athletic performance user interface I ever used, but it's very ill conceived. While the watch is awesome for its focus and simplicity, the software is plagued with too many buttons, icons, panels, and drop down menus. It's a mess that a geek working for Garmin felt was best left for you to figure out rather than design it correctly. I'll probably find out it works just fine, but a user shouldn't have to put in multiple hours of time to do so."
Great charger. very effecient; puts off no heat. Has very clean DC rails. Way better than many other charger I've had in the past.
"I received this with a promotional discount from the seller in exchange for an honest review. I already own 5 other similar USB battery packs so I feel I can make an adequate comparison. The battery is quite light and not larger than other even though 13000 mAh. With the discount, this was by far the lowest I have paid for one and yet it is the largest capacity. There are two USB ports, which is nice, and I think should be the standard on any USB battery you buy these days. Not issues so far with charging or use although have only had it for a few days. It also comes with a standard USB wall charger. It is an exact knockoff from the standard Apple wall charger for the iPhone (even with the same green dot and similar writing), however, you can easily tell it is a fake by its cheap built quality. The adapter cord it comes with is also made very cheap. You aren't buying this for those extras so I wish they would have just left those out and instead lowered the price even more or spent more on the USB battery itself."
"I was pleasantly surprised with the case. The quality of the product was good, it fit the phone well & love the bling!"
"I installed two of these switches side-by-side in a 3 switch box and they've been working great for the last few months. It's tight fit, but all the wiring and connectors fit fine in the switch box. I was able to program these switches to turn on/off my porch and garage lights and they've been working flawlessly. The only small glitch, is that the green circular light on one of the switches is significantly dimmer than the other switch, and it looks a bit strange when looking at the two switches at night. Also, I had a glitch with the Android app which controls all of my WeMo Belkin devices while I was out of town, where it didn't seem to control the switches and lights. When I removed the Android app and reinstalled it, all of the connections and settings to my home devices were lost and I couldn't control anything! It wasn't until I returned home that I could re-setup everything once I connected to my home WiFi with my smartphone. I think Belkin has resolve this issue with an update to the app (also, my wife's iPhone app didn't have this issue).<br /><br />You do need a neutral wire in your switch box for these switches to work. My home was built in the early 1980's, so I did have the required neutral wire. My suggestion is to first look in your light switch box to see if you can find a neutral wire before ordering these switches. I did a Google search first and was able to find many resources explaining what to look for in finding the neutral wire setup."
Delivered on the day it said it would also looks exactly like the picture!
"I love this product, it was a gift for my son and he also love it. service, time of delivery and the product was excellent"
"Nice case, one of the few cases that do not actually make the phone extremely bulky but actually protect the phone. Remember, tho it is quite cheap so do not be expecting any high end plastic or anything like that."
Quite rugged!  It's a little thicker than your basic case but that's to be expected with rugged.  USMC emblem is nicely done.  Semper Fi!
"I have been using this case for a few months now and it is still holding up great. I love the matte look and soft feel, yet it still seems to be protective."
Purchased for a company iPhone deployment.  Case is rugged but not bulky and the price was great.  The optional belt clip is nice as well.  A little work to open the case initially but well protected afterwards.
"My cord worked great, for three days. Then it would say &#34;charging&#34; but would not charge my phone at all. Very disappointed."
"Base was broken  where serial  screws on.on one ,unable to fix"
I ordered the wrong size case and the company was excellent to work with. They are sending the right size with no charge. The case itself is plastic and the color was a bit too bright but for the price it is great.
"Privacy is exactly as described. It might make the screen too dark in the daylight. Many times I literally cannot see the screen. I am not sure if a different protector would give different results, as I put this on immediately upon purchasing the phone. Also, it scratches and shows finger oils, so if you have a sliding lock protection, it gives a thief a big hint."
"The phone is OK, and there are many cool apps for it. But it is seriously short on memory. 4 GB with only 2 GB available for the user.<br /><br />It has a slot for an additional memory card inside next to the battery. I put a 32 GB memory card in there only to find out that the operating system won't allow me to use it properly. All applications must be installed on the phone's main memory, and there doesn't seem to be any way to designate the additional storage card for most of the data storage for those applications. The short version is that the additional memory card slot is useless regardless of what memory card you add to it.<br /><br />I am not sure if the issue with app/data location is a problem with the phone design or the operating system. I've read where it is the operating system limitation. In either case, most of the smartphone functions are unusable.<br /><br />I had ordered this to replace my old flip-phone. But this thing is roughly 3 or 4 time larger then my flip-phone, plus the selling features being the available applications are simply not usable. I guess that I will continue to use my old flip-phone and keep this for a backup phone."
"Don't waste your money on these. While the flexible cord is convenient, the charge is not. Very first time I plugged one in, by the time I checked my phone again it said the accessory was not compatible. I also woke up one morning with my phone at 46% because it stopped charging. Junk product, I would love to return them and get my money back"
"Fast shipping, good packaging and excellent item. Highly recommended."
Good Solid product.  4 stars because if you don't get the watch on it correctly it doesn't charge.  This is only a minor nit...  I keep it by my bedside and I would buy it again.
ArrIved on time. This is so far the best USB Charger
first time I dropped my iPhone 5c in THIS case it destroyed my screen completely and it continually cracked more and more so this case is a complete piece of crap and definitely did not DEFEND my phone!
&#34;I received a discount on my order for a fair review&#34; I think this awesome.
"The photo for the product and the actual product are not the same. The product photo shows a glass protector that would cover the entire glass portion of the watch, but the actual protector seems to barely cover the &#34;screen&#34; part. The glass protector honestly looks really stupid on the watch given that it is smaller than the glass, and you can see there's a rectangle where the protector sits. I doubt it provides much protection and just serves to make the watch ugly. I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review."
It was a gift for my hb birthday and it definitely is making a difference on his life... he is moving more and committing to his goals!
"The case works is best for all intents and purposes, the screen protector that comes with the case may leave a small amount of residue behind when it is first applied which can make your phone have an air bubble appearance, other than that I have 0 complaints, the elastic case is phenomenal often I would wear the case without the hard covering, though it two hard cases that are included are a perfect fit.  The belt clip case can be doubled as a horizontal kickstand so you can watch your movies or youtube videos with ease.  The kickstand case itself provides maximum coverage of the phone protecting the key points of the phone where the glass is most likely to fracture.  The stylus that is included works wonders, if its ever too cold for your fingers to be outside its a dream. All in All this product is a perfect buy, great if you just need a case to protect your phone, the white and black coloring of the case also ensure that you'll look stylish."
"Charges fast and slow. I Like the 2+ miliamp usb. Bought 2 of them. One broke in initial use hence the 4 stars. I had to dismantle it and solder the bottom spring back on the circuit board, so now it works again. Just a fluke I hope. Happy with purchase I do recommend these."
"Purchased this product for my trip to Cancun, Mexico. This was a great buy for the trip because we were at the beach, pool and ancient sink-holes all throughout the trip. Never once let any water into the case and kept my phone safe from damage. Only reason the rating is 4/5 is because I wish I was able to take pictures with this product under water, every time I tried to use it under water with my iPhone it wouldn't allow me to click a picture. When I purchased this product I was under the impression it would not only protect my iPhone from water but allow me to take pictures underwater. Maybe this product is only really for above water picture-taking and to protect the phone from water. I'm going to look into purchasing a go-pro or underwater camera so I can take clear pictures underwater. Nonetheless, this was a good purchase."
If I could pick &#34;0&#34; start I would. It broke in a day. Bad quality.
Works as its supposed to. The first one I received burned out after a few seconds. I notified Amazon and they sent another one at no charge. The second one I received works just fine. A cable is not included with this charger which is rather annoying but it is what it is. Overall I am pleased with it.
Love this phone! I liked that I could pick the color and it looks better in person. I had no problem with my carrier with the start up of the phone. Great quality for a great price.
"I wish there was a place, like a zippered pocket for change. Kind of awkward using the phone...but still is great for on the go running around."
Have had this case on my iPhone 6 since day 1 and still love it.
"It's not really what I expected but it served the purpose I need it for. I had cracked my green and was looking for a phone case that had a full clear screen that would cover my cracked screen to give it a little more protection from getting any worse. However when I ordered this I was expecting an actual phone case but it's not, it's plastice stickers, one goes on the back and one goes on the front. So it did fullgill the purpose I needed it for and it was fast delivery."
What a piece of CRAP! Could not get it to tune better than 3:1 with a good ground on the vehicle. Save your money and buy a mag mount or nmo mount 2 meter antenna.
"Great product wish it came with two because when squeaking out the liquid it left marks on the screen protector, like indications (not nice).  However easy to install just wish I had another to replace this and get a more seamless look."
Love this case! Arrived earlier than expected and I love how sturdy it is. Worth the price!
"**I was given this product at a discounted rate for my honest review**<br /><br />Charger/cord works great for my Nook HD+. Bag would work well also, but our Nook is in a case, so it wouldn't fit, (bought this primarily for for the charger though.) Would definitely recommend buying here before going through B&N to buy a replacement cord/charger."
Brought this less than a month and broken already. Do not buy. Waste your money
"great quality, it took some drops, scratches tough screen protectors but phone was drop in the pool,screen look great but iPhone 6+ was DOA !"
"Very nice case. Seems very well made and should do a great job protecting the phone. Was easy to put on. The only thing I could see being a downfall is I think the stand may break after a lot of use, so keep that in mind if you are buying it for the kickstand. Otherwise great product<br /><br />I received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"
"I love the look of this case -- it's so pretty and I get lots of compliments.  But after six months, the floral pattern is starting to wear off where it gets handled a lot.  It has also been scratched off the back in a few places from putting it in my purse next to a hard object."
"This case works and looks great.  It holds my license, 2 credit cards and cash and still closes with the magnetic clasp."
"Very cute but the light sensor being on the bottom is a bit of a design flaw. If there was something else plugged in under it, the sensor would be blocked and it would constantly stay on even in a lit room. Then again, it worked in some rooms and didn't work so well in others (Lighting issues). Either way, for the cost, it's worth it and it's really bright. The color fades very smoothly, and only the middle light changes colors -- Which is nice because it doesn't overdo it. Would buy again!"
"not bad for 11 bucks, but it is a bit hard to hear with ambient noise, like in the car. might suggest getting one with two earbuds."
"I am in touch with their customer support. The package did not include a wet wiper cloth, nor did it include orange tabs to hold the plastic on while you work. The installation video that the documentation refers you to does not match one of the installation videos on their site, increasing the confusion. they have said they will make sure I am happy and get it installed. I have two phones I'm installing this one. So far, I have had to throw out 2 of the 3 screens because I was unable to install them without dust getting stuck. so far, I am unhappy. the one phone I did install ended up getting one dust bubble small still there, but since it is off the usable screen, I said ok, I can live with that, rather than trying to peel it off and introducing more inevitable dust. This process is not simple folks. Maybe just bring your phone to those guys in the mall who do this for a living.<br /><br />I just upgraded my review from 2 stars to now 3 stars. Mr Shield sent me a replacement package of 3 shields since my first shot at installing on 2 phones ended up with only 1 phone ok, and two discarded shields due dust. Today I tried again to install a shield on my wife's phone. Again, take number 1 failed after I got some dust under the final cover. When you do that, it's pretty much over and you need to discard. Their methods to remove dust, while valid, in practice are NOT easy to achieve. I think that once you get these on, they work fine, but getting them on is not as easy as other reviewers make it seem, IMHO."
"This case is a little chunky, but very durable and protects the phone very well. The headphone jack and charge port covers are very nice to have as this generation of phones has issues with pocket lint becoming jammed in these ports if they are not protected.<br /><br />One annoyance is that if you try to operate the phone with slightly damp hands or in humid environments, the moisture will wick off your fingers or out of the air and up between the screen and screen cover, requiring you to disassemble the case to wipe the screen down every once in a while. However, to the case's credit, other than in the above situation there is never any noticeable decrease in screen sensitivity when using the screen protector."
"I like the way this case looks. It is very sleek. The downside is that it does not have great grip and tends to slip out of my hands very easily. Overall, a great case."
Fits good and looks like it will protect my phone. I am a little worried that it will fall off because the way it clicks on to your phone.
Received product.  Looked like genuine Apple Headphones but they were knockoffs and the product was broken.  Very unhappy with my order.
OMG!! I love my new case 😍👌🏽
"In short, this is a great iPhone 6 case. I give this product four stars only because the back cover is made of plastic instead of metal.<br /><br />Pros: interchangeable back plates, sturdy, lightweight, dust and splash proof, has a built-in screen protector, beautiful design.<br /><br />Cons: back plates made of plastic instead of metal, 3.5mm phone jack and charging port may be difficult to open.<br /><br />Here is the long story. I received this case yesterday. The shipping speed by USPS is very fast and only takes less than 48 from ordering till receiving the product. The package is a large yellow foam envelop, though not very sturdy, the product is intact during the shipping.<br /><br />Then I opened the box and found the parts of the case. There are three back plates with three color: silver, black and golden. So whichever color your iPhone is, you can only change the back plates and have a feeling of change a new phone. The only imperfection is the material of the back plate - plastic. In the product photo I had a feeling that it was made of metal. But the touch of the plastic back plate is still very comfortable.<br /><br />Then I pulled out my iPhone 6 from the old case and cleaned it with the cloth coming with this product. I peeled off the protective films and everything is ready. When I was trying to put my iPhone into this case, it feels a little bit hard, but not very difficult. I managed it after 30 seconds. Now the case is seamlessly with my iPhone, they look beautiful and feel great. The iPhone 6 is very light and the case is light too, and their combination is still light enough to carry in hands or in pockets.<br /><br />The case does a great job protecting your iPhone. It is more sturdy than most of the half-shell-cases in the market. Its has a screen protector so you do not have to buy another one. It has another clear film on the back so you can see the Apple logo on your phone, where most half shells do not provide this view. The only open places are the home button, the camera lens and the flash, but that is not a big issue. The case is not waterproof, i.e. you should not immerse it in water. However I guess it can protect the iPhone from casual liquid splash like water, beverage or rain. It can also protect your phone from dusts if you are living in a arid area. The charging port, earphone plug and the buttons are all protected. It may be a little difficult to plug in your headphone because the rubber is hard there.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this case is a great protecting case for your iPhone 6. I am a very critical person so actually the case may exceed your expectation. But please keep in mind this quality of this case is better than most half shells on the market."
Absolutely fantastic...so small....so easy to operate and so stealthy. No one even knows you have it in your ear. It is ONE for whichever ear it fits the best and comes nicely packaged (makes a great gift). I was stunned at the perfect sound and the comfort of wearing it. Great quality and customer service at a really reasonable price. I was gifted this for testing and review and I highly recommend...now I need one for the car.
"Water tight? Sure is. IP68 rated which means that it is dust tight and water proof to 3 to 10 feet underwater for a continuous period of time... it passed our \\""paper towel in the kitchen sink\\"" test.<br /><br />Fit the iPhone 6 (4.7)? Sure does.<br /><br />Nice looking? I think so; nice clear case with a nice looking blue bumper border.<br /><br />Useful? If you are heading out for a complete day in wet conditions and know that you are never going to take your phone out of its case... then, OK. This case cold be just what you need.<br /><br />Useful for me? Nope... six tiny screws and one small Allen wrench, requiring 10 minutes to put back together with the phone inside and requiring a bit of eye to hand coordination as to not drop the tiny screws or tiny wrench and get the assembly job done. Oh dang.... decide that you need to take the phone out midday, and you are out of luck unless you remember to bring the tiny wrench too. Now wait... where is that little wrench?<br /><br />Interestingly unique super secure case that surely has its market out there. impressive IP68 rating.<br /><br />Go for it if you are looking for a case of this style and price. It works, if you have the patience.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
"Great clear case for my galaxy edge 6 plus. Fits perfectly. These cases are perfect for making your own designs. Like using stickers, glues and glitters. You can also put a picture behind it and interchange the pictures when you want. The craft ideas are endless. I definitely recommend. I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest and unbiased review."
Please do not get it because it will look great but then the color of it just start to look bad
"It's a great case it provides a lot of protection I dropped my case once and It didn't even get damages on it, the only disadvantage of this case is it's a little bit hard to remove."
"Shipped quickly (Received in 2 days with prime) Came in OEM professional packaging, Received the LCD with frame and a small bag of replacement tools. Watched a youtube video and had my broken lcd replaced and even changed the color from blue to white all within about 45 minutes! Now I have a brand new phone again! Works perfectly!"
"This is my review of the Hasbell Apple Watch Stand 2015 version. This is a nice stand for the apple watch.  It is fairly easy to setup which basically entails placing the charging cord into the groove on the side of the stand.  That's it.  The plastic material feels durable and its basic and simple design works well with the simple design of Apple.  For the price of less than $10, it is a good value.  Note: I received this sample for evaluation with a promotional coupon provided by the seller.  My reviews reflect my own experience with the product and is solely based on how well the product performed in design, function, and value.  A free or discounted product does not guarantee a good review, only an honest one.  I fully test and use the product I review."
Much stronger than my previous Spigen case which looks very similar to this case. I have dropped my phone so many times the case itself barely scratches and it keeps the phone well protected. The raised edges allow you to put it on a table or anywhere without the screen getting scratched so I don't even need a screen protector.<br /><br />This case has a bumper surrounding it which causes signal loss on my phone. I used to get 4-5 bars in certain places and now get about 2-3. My call quality still remains the same as far as I can tell but the signal loss is really noticeable when you put on and take off the case.
I bought this case after using an Otterbox for over a year. This case looks great on my IPhone 5s. It provides protection for the phone without adding the bulk like my old Otterbox case did. I highly recommend this case to anyone.
"Good charger. It does what it says it does. Not a cheap rip off, very impressed and would recommend highly."
I received the cable promptly and it works which I can't say for some of the lightning cables I've tried on amazon. The length is nice and the construction seems sturdy. I deduct a star because the lightning end connector is quite large and I can't use it with some of my iphone and ipad covers without taking the cover off. Their connector is approximately twice as thick as the Apple lightning connector. It will work for me in most cases though so I am overall happy with it
"Product is good, and in good condition. Would've appreciated some sort of instructions, or at least a link or url to get directions. There are ample videos and tutorials online and YouTube, but took a while to find a good one."
Great case but subpar kickstand. Very disappointed in the kickstand. Giving it 5 stars anyway bc I couldn't find another one with kickstand. Good price too.
"I love the solid structure of this stylus.  Leave the plastic tip on as that is a functional part.  I do not use the stylus to draw, just general use.  As such, it is not as good as the fiber tipped ones for my use.  It is noisy and does not hold the screen as well for dragging.  However,  I may not be using it in the application for which it was designed.  Seems like it will last forever due to the robust design.  I will likely have my grandson use this stylus when he visits, as he is rough on my styluses."
"Wonderful product from NetSun This cable has a nice soft feeling to it and is rated for 4000+ bends! Never have to worry about taking them up on their 12 month warranty your phone will break before this cable does. At the price point it puts it at half the cost of the OEM cable so you'd be smart to pick up 2! You can never have enough iPhone charge cables. This works perfect with my 6, 6 Plus and iPad Air. It also supports up to 2.4AMPs and features a compact head. If it wasn't for the branding you wouldn't know its after market.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
"Works well in my 2011 Audi A6, sometimes there's skipping or it takes a while to show up in my Bluetooth list but other than that it beats the manual way of playing my music through the car."
Beautiful looking case for the price I've dropped my phone so many times and this case is still intact like new! Highly recommended
It was delivered with a faulty charging cable and couldn't replace it since my brother has taken it to India
Would not buy this product again. New style was not easy to work with.
"This phablet isn't bad for the money. The screen isn't too bad and the angles look pretty good to me.<br /><br />The weird thing is this device has Amazon app store and Google play. There are several apps on here that can be uninstalled, but for example the default Amazon app (the shopping one) can't be uninstalled, and it's not updated via Google. Similarly, this phone has the Android Gallery and Google Photos, so you can disable one and keep the other.<br /><br />With a little bit of uninstalling and disabling unnecessary apps on here, you'll end up with about five free gigs of space on the phablet, and the sd slot is nice. I like that it has Android 5 already even if the starting apps are redundant or unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall this is more a device for tweens and people who want to show their big phone off, so I feel for the buck, it's worth the bang as a casual device."
"Now that I have tried this tablet stand, I'm not sure how I worked without it. As a software tester I often work on my computer with my tablet next to me and this makes it so much easier. It has a push button to bring out the back support - this also keeps it sturdy so that it isn't falling over. It works great with my Kyocera Android smartphone, my iPad Mini and my Kindle Fire 6. If you have a really thick case such as one with a keyboard in it then it might not fit but thin cases are not a problem.<br />The front of this stand is made from a heavy metal. The front lip is a rubber or plastic so as not to scratch your device. There is also rubber on the bottom to protect the desk. The support in the back is plastic.<br />I plan on using this everyday!<br />I received this product in exchange for my honest review."
We ordered this case for my sony experia z1. This case does not fit the z1. The needed openings you need to get to the charging port and the headphone Jack are covered. You have to remove the entire case to charge your phone or listen to headphones. Do not get this it does not work for the z1.
"Great case, just thought it came with a belt clip and screen protector. Guess I should have gotten the Maxx!"
"The product was just as advertised, the price was excellent, thank-you for the bonus one."
"Junk! Super thin case, barely covers the phone. Don't waste your money"
Phone holder does not lock in with mount. Both phone and holder fall off by the slightest touch.
"It doesn't charge anything. I sat my Android down and went to sleep with it charging using this, but the battery was the 9% when I woke up. After inspecting it to make sure I didn't plug it in correctly I discovered it doesn't even work. It's a useless piece of junk."
As usual Amazon and their partners did an excellent job with this product it fits great looks fabulous and the whole purchase was outstanding I definitely recommend this product and the store it came from.
I just transferred the buttons over to my Honda remote because the lock symbols had worn off with use. Works perfectly.
Great case for my Samsung camera.  Fits perfect!  Highly recommend.
"I really like how the case fits the phone snuggly and doesn't add much bulk to the phone while still seeming to provide adequate protection. It's not going to protect your screen if you drop the phone on it, but it does have good corner protection. The gold bumper complements the gold color of the phone and makes the case blend in to look like a part of the phone. I use my wireless charger with no problem at all, but I have experienced where the charging port on the case was either be too small or too tight on a wired charger. I have about six micro USB chargers sitting around the house from other various electronics and only two of the slimmer ones were useable once the case was on. The charger that came with the phone itself will not fit in the charging port with this case. That is the reason it got 4 stars and not 5 stars."
This is the second product I bought from this company the first was for an android razor Maxx the second for an iPhone 6 I am very pleased with both products.
This review is technically the same as the other 2 cases. Only difference is this one does not have strap to carry it on the wrist. Color is very pretty though. I will use it on days when I carry a purse. I received this item in exchange for a review. Very satisfied
Fairly slippery material. The card door is still intact after having it over a month and a half. But I don't open it all the way or hammer on it. I'm gentle with it. Great case. Going to be perfect for my traveling. Too worried to bring a purse so this is perfect!
"Pros:<br />Above average sound, esp considering the price.<br />Lightweight.<br />Came with multiple options for earbuds and securing- took a while to get comfortable secure fit, but a good result is just about guaranteed if you put the time into it.<br />Charge with any microUSB line.<br />Paired with my Note 4 easily.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The multifunction switch is difficult to access and seems like it will break easily (but hasn't so far in a couple of months of rough use).<br />It will go consistently for 3-3.5 hours, then quits rather abruptly, and I haven't found a &#34;check battery&#34; function.<br />Instruction booklet is rudimentary/minimally helpful.<br />It doesn't connect automatically to my Note 4 when I turn it on.<br /><br />Summary: good value for the price ($25); don't expect perfection."
"These have never worked well for me.  This sticks extremely well and I use it for the larger iPhone 6 plus with a case.  The magnet holds it just fine however, the ball would not stay in position.  This was an easy fix.  You can unscrew the rotating ball.  I placed a small strip of electrical tape over it and attached the screw on magnet back over top.  Now the ball stays positioned exactly where I aim it while holding the heavier iPhone 6.  Best car phone mount I've ever used.  I hope it holds up!"
"Great sound when you adjust it in places Kind of hard to put in , cable in the back is bothersome."
Applied VERY easy (started at bottom of phone and lifted the back protective shield at the bottom and as I pushed my finger up- the remaining protective back shield peeled off) It was flawless and NO bubbles.  VERY happy with this product.
"Great battery lots of life. However, due to the plastic the battery is very slippery. This battery doesn't support Qualcomm quick charge."
Worked for about a week and then quit. Glad I didn't pay much at all but it would have been nice to have an extra charger for my phone.
This is one heavyweight charger. It will charge 2 device at once. There is a screen that tells you the percentage of power you have left. This is a great back up source for larger device or if you are going to need multiple recharges on a smaller device. It is the heaviest power bank I own but also the one with the most charging capacity. When we head on our trip next month this is the one that will go with me on the plane and ship because it will have enough charge for my phone and kindle. Very well made charger that charges quickly. Sample received in exchange for an honest review.
Not for S6 Active
Hated the color....RED is not my favorite color<br />Thought it would be more on the &#34;rose&#34; color other than that hopefully it serves the purpose since I haven't even tried it on my phone.
"2 regular cables, just like the regular USB cables I already have. The tips are NOT extended. Don't waste your money."
This charger seems legit. Works fine with no issues.
Really handy.  I use it every day.
Not happy with cover.  One sides fits well to phone and the other three do not.  It appears to be stretched and the phone sticks up above the cover on those three sides.
"I am so glad the Wife and I decided to ignore the previous user's review regarding the charging port. This case has EVERY feature my Wife was looking for (case color, included wrist strap, and the hole in the ID Card's see-thru plastic that allows you to easily slide the card out if needed. The case's black bezel is a &#34;Piano Black&#34; finish (very shiny), and it wraps around the whole phone. With the case fully enclosed, we are confident this case would prevent damage to the phone in the event of an accidental drop from waist height.<br /><br />We couldn't be happier with the case, and at these prices, it's a wonderful deal! I'm actually jealous the Wife got a better case than I got at the local Verizon store for a lot more $$."
Excellent item. Able to adjust to so many angles to fit the interior space available in your car. Holds the phone securely. Love it!
"In need (or want) of a 4 port USB wall charger, I decided to try out the Anker PowerPort 4 charger. Even though I care more about function than design in a charger, Anker did a very nice job with the look and feel of the PowerPort 4. It has a nice heft to it, weighing in at 5.1oz. As for functionality, the Anker PowerPort 4 charger easily passed my test. I plugged in 4 devices in need of some juice and the PowerPort 4 simultaneously charged all four devices in a short amount of time.  Here are the results of my charging test for the Anker PowerPort 4. All devices were charged simultaneously until all devices were 100% charged. Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ - reached 100% in 30 minutes, starting at 83%. Nexus 6 - reached 100% in 80 minutes, starting at 53%. iPhone 6 - reached 100% in 35 minutes, starting at 80%. iPad Air 2 - reached 100% in 105 minutes, starting at 35%.  I am so happy with this charger from Anker. It does everything I need it to do without skipping a beat. No longer do I need to carry four separate chargers when I travel, which makes the PowerPort 4 a winner in my book."
The case itself is nice the belt clip broke the first week i had it. Its an ok case for the price.
I was not at all pleased with these earbuds.  The sound was very crackle for the other person on the phone.  And despite several plastic options to &#34;fit&#34; different ears.  These would not stay comfortably and securely in my ears.
"The seller did send the item as described and on time. I hate this phone cause I went from an HTC 816 to this since the screen broke. I'm trying to save money to buy a better one but I don't recommend this one. The phone works fine but I went from a high tech phone to this cheap one so it's very annoying. The camera is low quality, videos on YouTube are low quality, screen brightness is horrible, that's why I gave it four starts."
"A) The ONLY glass screen protector for the Samsung S6 that completely covers the screen edge to edge. Every other glass screen protector leaves a gap, which I could not stand.<br />B) Removable in case you mess up, but it's pretty easy to place on in one shot<br /><br />I can't recommend this enough. So worth the money."
My wife is in love with this phone got it for her for birthday present and hasn't had any complaints about it.
"I've had the case for over a year now and it's holding up great.<br />You know when you drop your phone or see someone else drop their phone and it just sounds really bad and nasty? this one doesn't sound like that. when I drop my phone it sounds more like a thud than a clack. it just sounds so firm that I feel perfectly comfortable with the fact that it was dropped on a hard surface. So this case is either very well built or the htc one m8 is very well constructed. its probably both.<br />The only thing that didn't work for me is the power button on the case, it protrudes a little too much and I would accidentally press it in my pocket quite often. luckily its removable so I just took it off, granted it looks a little funny with it off since itll just have a hole on top of it but to be honest I kind of prefer it.. no more unintentional pressing of the power button!"
I brought them for my wife and she totally loves the colors and also uses them for writing too .Thank you for these pens.
"This is sitting on my desk and works great.  I have Galaxy S6 and while running No-Screen off and music the phone is always at 100% charge, and charges quickly.  In fact, running a &#34;test&#34; the wireless charger only increased the charge time by 10% (according to my phone).<br />FOr those with the Tech 21 Armor case: When sitting the phone vertically the case raises the phone enough where it is not seated exactly right and sometimes the charge stops.  I just have the phone sitting horizontally and that solves the problem"
"I looovvve these phone covers. I like a gripping cover so my phone doesn't slide around in a bag or pocket. These are light-weight, fit very nicely to the phone not interfering with the function, and I love all of the colors. I change the cover often, wash it in hot soapy water and let it dry, and go to another one sort of like mood rings! Really I didn't need all of the colors in this set but I have given a couple to friends. I particularly love the hot orange, lime green, and two different pinks."
"I'm seeing a trend here, I've been very pleased with EVERY Anker product I've purchased.<br /><br />My 13 y/o daughter had purchased a selfie stick at a retail store and the quality was terrible, broke within a few days.<br /><br />This Bluetooth model is SOLIDLY built and a great value for the price paid."
I live in NYC and ride in central park (6 mile loop). It often takes several miles for this unit to find the satellites. I have also used the Garmin 800 but it has the same issue (actually worse). I wish Garmin would fix this problem.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Price<br />- Customizable fields<br /><br />Cons<br />- Poor reception<br />- Small screen<br />- Buttons difficult to use
"Loved the product for 2 months until it quit working. Display screen no longer works. Sent email to garmin received no response.There are many other choices available for this type of product, in my eyes a very poor way to run a company. I also have other Garmin products but sadly to say when it comes time to replace them I will opt to purchase a different brand. I have no time for a company that cannot even contact a loyal customer who received a faulty product."
"This this is a life saver. I NEVER right a review, however, I'm writing this review because it has saved my live plenty of times. I love how I can charge two things at once (two phones or my phone and bluetooth). The flash light feature is an excellent addition. Two Thumbs Up!!"
Fast shipping. Only problem people say they can't hear me good and volumes all the way up.
this case is so amazing..ive dropped m phone down the stairs twice and a bunch of other damaging things and my phone stayed in perfect condition externallyand internally ... sadly i just lost my phone but i bought a new one..that and model the next day and ordered this case again
"Shipping was fast and item was as described! I have a iPhone 5s and it gives me 63% to 95% battery from when my phone is at about 1%. 63% if I'm playing games/watching stuff 95 if I let the phone sit and charge. The case was a little wonky, but little pieces of tape on the sliding parts remedied the issue. Case also takes a long time to charge. I purchased a mophie case for $100 at AT&T which DIDNOT sync through the case and gave me the same battery life as the UNU. Ultimately I'm happy with the purchase.  For 1/4 of the price of a mophie, this case does the job, looks great and actually SYNCS THROUGH THE CASE! would recommend to someone."
"Love these cases. Great use? DISNEY WORLD / WATER PARKS!!!. While yes most rides at disney don't involve water, you are going to get wet on the river rapids as well as get wet when it RAINS DAILY!!! I take this case with me every time I got to the local water park, then i can keep my phone with me when I am soaking in the lazy river. Just make sure the seal is good and tight. I have never had a problem with this, just a precaution. The packing is awlays superb with FRiEQ, nothing but the best, love their products."
"It's a cheap but sturdy case. For $10 bucks, it is not going to be an Otterbox. I got the phone on sale for $20 (Verizon Prepaid).<br /><br />YES! There is a major design flaw. I found that out when I put in my phone and it turned on the camera. I read the reviews and another reviewer said that they altered the holder to fix the problem.<br /><br />I was faced with two choices. Return the case to Amazon--which is NEVER any problem. Or, use some ingenuity and inspiration (from the other reviewer) and fix the problem. I chose the latter option.<br /><br />First, I marked off the offending segment of plastic on the right holder of the belt holster. Basically, where the volume button hits it when the phone is docked. Then, using a pair of scissors, I cut slits in the holder a bit further than the area, bent the pieces of plastic down and cut them off.<br /><br />Its not pretty, but it worked. (It is entirely possible that the case designers did not know that the phone would bypass the lock screen to the camera by the volume button.)<br /><br />The one thing I don't like is that the phone cannot be docked in the belt holster screen out, so that you could watch a movie. After all, why does the holster have a brace to hold the clip. WHY?<br /><br />However, the inside case has its own brace for tabletop viewing. It is not that sturdy--as stated by other reviewers. I am just trying to be careful."
This is a great case for the iPhone 6.  It's rigid with just a hint of give which is great for absorbing shock.  This fits very snugly so there is no chance this is coming off of your phone unless you want it to.  I did a few drop tests on a hard surface from about 3 ft. up & it protected my phone very well.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great case for their iPhone 6.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
"Great product, good sound quality. Only a few problems: Every time you turn it on, it won't automatically connect with your pre-set device and you have to go to your bluetooth settings to reconnect it. And I found that the buttons on Shower-Mate are working only when I play music from iTunes. I can't use them to adjust volume or skip a music if I use other applications or websites to play musics."
"This is my second Zeox case (I accidentally dropped and slightly cracked my first one :-( )  Even with a cracked case, I performed a water test and it did not leak, but I didn't want to risk it.... However, the one I have now had an issue with people telling me they could not hear my voice as it was severely muffled on their end.  After doing an online search, I found that if you take the cover off, find the tiny microphone cover (slightly to the left of the black button on the bottom of the phone) and blow 3-4 seconds into the hole, (like you're blowing into a straw) it totally took care of the problem.  I would recommend this case to anyone who lives around water or, like me, is accident prone..."
My niece loved it.  It is exactly the way it looks on here.
"a fun and pretty case, but doesn't protect the screen at all, also not rubberized so could easily crack."
I have an watch exactly like this one and it didn't cost as much was pricy but love the watch had it for several  years and it lasted and still ticking.
Replace this with same one.<br />Old one ends always slid up and finally got a short but it gave great sound.<br />So got new one
The case came in fine. The little green thing that is in the inside of the case is to big. Since the case won't deal properly. I took the green thing out for right now. Contacting the lifeproof company on Monday to hopefully get it fixed. For right now my case is not waterproof.
Just received and installed this case its nice and fits snug.... But it is super slippery i already dropped my phone within minutes of installing it. For looks its good but you might be dropping you're phone more often than before. I think im sticking to my old case for now.
I must admit that I suck installing these protectors so this was very easy to me to install. The phone look like as if it had nothing installed on the screen. fit very very well.
"No replaceable batter,  oh well.  No memory card slot,  no big deal.  No IR Blaster?  WTH!  I use that thing exclusively as my only remote control for every TV in the house,  my stereo,  my Tivo.....  Everything.  I realize a lot of people don't know they had IR or what it is for,  but for me this is a complete deal breaker.  I was really looking forward to this phone too."
this is a great case AND it comes with a screen protector (a + in my book)<br />my iPhone 6 fits perfectly in the case and there was no problem putting the screen protector on.<br />very sturdy and I know it will last for a very long time.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review<br />thank you. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review
Works great on my highlander. I had a doubt how it would keep itself there but it works perfect even on sharp turns. Relieves me of the annoying suction fixture which keeps falling on hot sun!
I love the case. It's thin as described and holds two cards perfectly.
"I bought this case for my wifes iphone 6. The fit is really great and she loved the color. It is thick enough that the camera doesn't touch when placed on its back. Button feel is really great on the volume control and not stiff like some other cases I have tried. It also has plenty of room around the headphone jack for headphones that have a larger jack. The only downer is that due to the material, it does get dirty over time and start to loose its vibrant color but that's to be expected over time. Not a deal breaker for a case that is this affordable. She has dropped her phone plenty of times and no damage yet so the case appears to protect against damage in that regard. Great case overall!"
Great has saved my phone several times!! Phone fell into a bucket of paint - saved. Toilet - saved - dog got my phone - phone damaged but would have been worse w/o case ❤️❤️❤️ The case.
the extender works grate it was a fair deal i'am very pleased thank you anthony.
"I own a corolla 2010, and  so  I bought  a Chinese brand radio/navi/bluetooth that  fit  perfectly into the  double din slot on  my  dash. It even had the  toyota logo. It  looked  like  it  was made in the  corolla. It  was  called the  &#34;Pumpkin &#34;. I only  had  it  for  a month  before I began  noticing that  the  gps led me wrong, the  bluetooth wasnt  auto-connecting, the radio had static. I sent  it  right  back  to  Amazon and  bought  this  lovely  gadget.<br /><br />The  pioneer doesn't  look  like  it  was  built into  the  corolla, nor does  it  display  the toyota  logo  on  the  screen,  but I don't  care.  I love  it! When  people  are  talking  to  me  on  bluetooth,  they  don't  sound  muffed, they  sound great. The  microphone is  positioned on  the  drivers side making  it  easy  for  them to  hear  me.  Since  I had  the  pioneer, i have not heard  one  complaint  from the  receiver. It  auto-connects with  no  hassel. The  radio is HD therefore  no  static. Works with  my  audio and bluetooth steering controls  (using metra interface). The radio displays the  artist and the name  of  the  song in large  print. It also depending on  the  radio station displays a picture of  the  artist and/or DJ.<br /><br />I only  listed  some of  many  good  things about this  radio. It's  very  pricey, but  you  get  what  you  pay for. The Pumpkin was  only  $250, and  I wanted  to  throw it  out  of  my  window. I would  rather  pay $500+ and  get  something  that  works. $250 is  a lot to  pay when something  doesn't  work  properly.<br /><br />The  only  thing  I worry  about  is  someone  breaking  into  my  car  and  taking my  radio.  I know  I have  the  option  of  removing the face."
This case has protected my galaxy s3 since purchase back in 2012!! This case is spectacular! Phone and case have taken many spills on concrete and will bounce down a hallway. No joke. Phone is still running just fine! (Only replaced original battery last year)
"Very rugged but also very heavy, I like it that way."
"its from sprint, and their cellphones are Never unlocked atleast and can't be unlocked unless you use net 10 wireless to activate it which I did with an old sprint cellphone. The reasons I want it it's because it has ptt capabilities just like Nextel iden cellphones used to have( it's a feature I miss on my cellphones the most), it's rugged, it's a basic and easy to use cellphone,  it looks more like a men's cellphone. I want this cellphone so bad, but can't afford it yet."
"This is a great product at a third the cost of an OEM battery. Twice the power of original equates to longer standby and run time. I highly recommend this product over all comers for quality and price. Originated from a new startup company in Japan, who would be a better fit as Samsungs competition? Would and will buy again, suggest you will as well. Thanks and I wish the founding company prosper as they should."
The first time that I used it it was good ty ty but the more I use it is loose the case
Solid product.  Good purchase!
"Does not work on Moto X. Screws up proximity sensor. I'm unable to get the screen to come on during ANY phone calls which prevents the use of keypad, speakerphone, hanging up, etc."
"I am adding my support for this item. I have a Note 4 and have tried several holders. This one is great. Multiple positions and never lets go of the phone...Easy in and out.<br /><br />I have tried the magnetic ones, the ones where you put a metal disc on the phone and a strong magnet holds it in place. Forget them. They never hold the phone tight enough and the phone shifts and moves or falls off.<br /><br />This is the one to get. I have used about four different types. This one is the keeper."
"It's an okay product. Would be better if it went around the screen more and weren't plastic. The card slot was hard to get cards/IDs out too. Plus, if you drop your phone the case cracks and bad"
"This cover shield is awesome and took a whole minute to install. No air bubbles after installation, highly recommend :0)"
Used the case for vacation at water park and worked great. Clear photos and video underwater. Works great when your toddler wants to throw it across the room.
Very good case and plus it has my favorite player and the greatest spur of all time besides Tim Duncan on it. If your a huge San Antonio spurs fan like me this is a great case!!
"I bought these to rid myself of those burdensome wires during workouts, just as many can probably relate, as I was getting annoyed over that darn wire that always gets in the way and just loves to pop out of the headphone jack, interrupting your groove mid run or sprint. Several moments like those have convinced me that this kind of headphone would be the right answer, and so far it has been. These wireless noise canceling headphones by Blimark® are now my favorite set of earphones for taking to the gym!   To start, they pair easily with an iPhone or iPod, as well as many other Bluetooth-enabled devices, and they work in a very comfortable distance of 10 meters. The earpieces fit snuggly and comfortably behind the ears, offering a secure hold while doing your workout routines. Even during the most vigorous portions of aerobic jumping, or any aggressive move, they hold on very well. The sound quality is not quite Bose level, but music through it sounds really great, especially for its lower price bracket, with surprisingly good mid and high tones.   I am also extremely impressed by the extra long battery life it has of about five hours. That is plenty of time, which I make regular use of, for hours of wireless, carefree music or even a significant portion of an audio book. There is also a microphone, if a call needs to be taken, making it more convenient during a workout for those people and moments you would rather not miss. Overall, this is a really impressive set of earphones, perfect to take along on your active and on-the-go lifestyle excursions, without the tangle of extra wires!"
I have been on the hunt for a really good case for my iPhone 6 plus and I came across this Verus case and I am extremely satisfied! There is no signal loss as others have stated and it looks and feels very well built. If you're looking for a case this one should definitely be one to buy!
Well first off I was stupid and bought this when I have Verizon wireless and they don't support this phone unless you buy it from the store but I returned it and got it at the store and it's an amazing phone don't be intimated by the big screen you get used to it pretty quickly and it's fast! If you don't have Verizon get this phone!
"Idk if its an OEM product but it works just as good. NFC works, the cutouts are in place. Would buy again if needed."
"I see a lot of reviews that it is falling off, once I removed the sticky dash doughnut and only used the suction piece and after 2 months no issues. I did remove 1 star due to the fact that it can be cumbersome to place phone in it and unsafe to do so while driving.."
"Edit 9/22/15: Amazon (or Zendure) sent a replacement unit before I had the opportunity to initiate a return. The replacement unit appears to work as advertised. The energy level display is very helpful and the batteries appear to hold the advertised amount of juice. I am very pleased with the product at this point and am therefore changing my rating from 1 star to 5.  Prior review: I purchased the 2nd Gen A8 Pro to act as a backup power supply for my iPad. I use the iPad to run WingX when flying, so it's reassuring to know that if I lose electrical power in the plane, I have a backup power supply. Unless your backup power supply is this product, then you're out of luck. The product simply doesn't work and emails to customer support yield no response. Of the hundreds of items I have purchased from Amazon, this is, sadly, my first negative review. But, I feel other buyers should be aware that this premium product, sold at a premium pricepoint, provides no value.  Upon receiving the unit, I charged it using an iPad charger, as recommended in the small manual included in the packaging. The A8 Pro display read &#34;100%&#34;. I then attempted to charge my wife's Sony Z3 Compact and it managed to charge the battery from 56% to 79% in about 20 minutes before dying and flashing &#34;01&#34;.  So, while the unit looks cool and feels sturdy, in my experience it simply doesn't work. When emails to customer service for a premium product sold at a premium pricepoint go unanswered, then that product earns a poopy rating."
"I loved my Sony MDR EX100IP Earbuds and wanted to upgrade to Bluetooth with these headset.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-EX100IP-Earbuds-iPhone-White/dp/B00BN0N062/<br />So, my review is based on my experience with MDR-EX100IP<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Sound quality is good<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Too bulky & heavy for the ear - I was expecting much slimmer/lighter looking at the pictures<br />2. Cable brushing on neck creates noise that goes into ears amplified<br />  The cables being not soft, when they brush on the neck, it causes noise. That noise gets amplified by the sealed ear canal."
Quality is not the greatest.  Material is thin and side of phone is exposed by non overlap of material on edge.  Not worth $20 IMO.
"So far, everything is good except after we press the button to end a call, music still on. Is it part of the design, or design flaw. If it is design flaw, how to fix it?<br />Any help is appreciated."
This product did not protect my phone. The screws started to fall out after a few days. After the second drop my screen cracked. I am very disappointed. Looking for money to change my screen now. So sad about it......
"does NOT WORK - AT ALL. First unwrap, first plug in = ABSOLUTELY NO POWER, NO CONNECTIVITY,<br />N-O-T-H-I-N-G!!!<br />Advertised as shipping within three days, IMMEDIATELY following purchase page, the dates switched to a delivery time next month. So also a late and separated delivery, which is highly inconvenient with any sort of a life.<br />An absolute DO NOT BUY EVER."
The inside of the hard part looks like it was painted but it's a really durable case. Looks cute too
"Zero stars, if i could. I see now that I should have read the reviews before making this impulse purchase. I was so happy to receive these cables, and didn't expect them to be as good as the apple brand but they barely lasted a week. I have definitely learned my lesson and will not buy something like this again."
I'll give a 5 star but  is defective unit  works good for 2 week and  now went I make phone calls the screen goes black you can still hear but u can't  hang up  so I have to program my phone to end call with the power button  other than that everything works perfect
"This transmitter worked very well for a few days. After about 3 days, the plug stayed in the phone when trying to take it out. The supplier sent me a brand new one after contacting them that it broke. The new one they sent me is much worse that the old transmitter. The signal will work for a few second, then cut out, and then go back on. I do not recommend this product. I recommend spend $30 more and get one more reliable. They are better sounding, more stable, and look just as good."
I just came back from spending the summer in Europe and used this adapter in 5 countries.  It worked great everywhere (with an plug extension for the UK).  It's light and perfect.  I'd highly recommend it.
It is a worthless piece of adapter for Nokia Cell phone. Attached to  the antenna<br />from the same seller does not do any improvement in cell phone reception.<br />My recommendation is DO NOT BUY.
"Eh, kind of bling you but great"
I have wanted a solar panel charger for my phone for quite some time so when I came across this one that had great reviews and was a good price I couldn’t pass it up. 
"I received this product in exchange for a review and this is my honest opinion and review.<br /><br />This is a great party speaker and does the job very well, I have a 15' X 12' backyard with an 7ft wooden fence and this speaker plays loud enough to be heard even when there are people around talking, kids playing around and still this speaker unlike many speakers I had before get the job done and really a great addition to a small BBQ party.<br />The build quality is high and the finish of the plastic feels almost as if it's some carbon fabric that gives this speaker a nice rich feel.<br />First pairing was quite fast and after the first time it connects even faster.<br />SD card slot is great to consume battery life on phone or speaker.<br />Auxiliary output is also a great feature that will turn it into a music player (with an SD card in)<br />2 charging options which is really good (USB & DC5V that you can find from any old phone or camera)<br />Skip / play / pause buttons respond fast and the mode button will either connect or disconnect you from the bluetooth.<br />Hanging strap is awesome and turns this into a very Portable speaker even though it's not a small speaker.<br /><br />All in all its a great speaker for pretty much everywhere you go and it's sounds good.<br />Very simple to use and setup.<br />The kids love BBQ parties now since the music can be heard ;-)<br /><br />Seller was extremely fast with shipping and response, packaging was nice and protected.<br />Thank you Seller and Amazon for a superb service and product"
coating near the 16 pin end has already broken.  And I am careful with my cords.  Does charge quickly tho.
"I recently had to get a new phone and since I was so comfortable with my old Galaxy Note, I wanted the same type, so I got the Galaxy Note 4.  I then started looking for accessories for the phone and found this great package that contains everything I could ever want or need for my phone.  My favorite piece is the case.  It has two slots for a credit card and my driver's license and a little pocket behind those where I can stash some cash or a folded check.  That means I don't have to carry a purse or a wallet.  Yippee!  I love that!  This is a terrific package of items for a decent price.  I highly recommend it!"
"Fits the phone perfect. Can not beat the price!!  The stylus is ok, I just don't use them.  The colors are true, better than the pics online.  Will purchase again!"
Installed this unit but there was no improvement to my cell coverage. (little no increase in signal strength) I have 3 iPhone 5S phones.  I'm an engineer so I know I installed correctly. My issues were dropped calls and missed call while in the house. I returned it. I'm not saying it won't work for you but it didn't work for me.
"Simply the most powerful car charger there is...period.  I have not yet tried charging 2 devices at once yet, but I guessing based upon the specs., it will do fine.<br /><br />My last car charger would actually lose battery power if I ran just my Google Maps app running.  Now, I can have the map app. on, but several others and I still gain battery power....amazing!"
Feels like the glass on my phone! And thank you for being the EASIEST screen protector to put on ever. NO bubbles at all.
"I seriously love this thing!! At first.. I saw the deal.. Thought eh-- i'll probably never use it, but good price! WRONG-- not only has it bailed me out, but-- it's bailed out my friends too, and we can charge at the same time! AMAZINGLY slow battery drain.. Great buy!!"
Ther idea is great. It seems well designed. But I gave it as a gift to my son who runs 5-10 miles a day and the armband broke.
Had it for 4 months now and holding up well with a few small minor scratches.  Very beautiful and brings me great joy.  Switching phones now and want to get another DuroCase based on this experience.
This thing is freaking awesome. It's a little big but besides the size. It came in on time it works wonderfully and the color is great.
Great piece. Due to the size of my case and the large size of the iPhone 6 plus this adapter works great holding my phone on a heavy duty selfie stick for great pictures and videos.
TomTom was exactly what it said it was. Had all the maps loaded that it said it did. That was important because I was going to France. It worked like a champ right out of the box.
"I love the convenience of this charger.  It doesn't matter how carelessly I put the device on the charger, it will still charge.<br /><br />The mirrored-finish-background makes it difficult to tell when the light has changed from green to blue.  Also blue/green is a bad pair of colors to indicate charging status.<br /><br />It can get a little too warm.  I point a fan near it to make sure it gets a little cooler."
I received the wrong color cord and it doesn't even work. I thought it was a great deal but a waste of time and a few bucks. I messaged the sender and I haven't heard back from them yet.
It's a nice screen protector however it doesn't fit fully over the screen. There's always one side that isn't completely covered which I don't like.
The cover itself goes on as directed with minimal issues as long as you leave sufficient time to dry.  My reason for the 1 star is that after 1-2 weeks I begin to get bubbles underneath.  I have tried two sets with the same results.  I will look for another type cover or just a rugged armor protected case
"I have a nokia lumia phone. Nothing fancy and nothing big as others I've seen. I have a case on the phone and this does make it thicker. Regardless, it doesn't work either way. It barely holds the phone without the case on, so there's no way it holds it with the case. As others have mentioned with the same style holder, the button used to adjust the size pushes the phone forward, so the bottom curved pieces are barely holding the corners of the phone. The top of the mount is another bad design that only helps to make it worse, pitched forward with the &#34;hook&#34; turned upward. The result is the phone can be tightened down on, but it's barely got a grasp of it and between the adjustment button and the top part pushing it out,  I'm betting the first bump in the road will send the phone flying.<br /><br />The gooseneck seems pretty solid but the outlet mount can be iffy depending on your car's outlet. In one vehicle it fit pretty snug and didn't twist in the outlet. But in another, the outlet appears to be shorter and it doesn't go in all the way. And I'm guessing it's also slightly bigger around, since it ended up twisting over to the side from the weight. So it depends, but what does that matter if it won't hold the phone in the first place? Perhaps it's just my cheap lumia, but to me looking at it, unless you have a super-thin phone I wouldn't suggest trying this."
"Its nice and slim and clear, but theres' opennings  both Front and back and left side,  I don't feel my phone is 100% protected.  The photo it's clear and does not show that. I bought this for about a month and it's already broken ... Not a good purchase"
This worked great to hook up to our speaker that we had and when IPhone adapters had switched.  It was cool it was Bluetooth and we could use it with actually having to put our device on it.  Clear non-interrupted streaming.
The quality of hairing and goes in and out real staticky a lot of people can't hear me so I have to turn them off
I've been using it for weeks and it works just as well as the one that came with my iPhone.
"Have this for about 2 weeks. Works great.  Charges my phone 2-3 times per full charge of the charger.  Use it to charge my Kindle too.  Very pleased, so far.  Seems to be a great value."
"Inrresponsable to not assume the guarantee of a bad product , with only a month to use the phone company does not turn , this should be punished to the American law for fraud !"
"Its cutouts allow me easy access to the camera lens, speaker, jack ports, etc.  The plastic part is ridged so the phone is not slippery when in my hand, and the case is snug and sturdy.  But frankly, after its functionality was assured, the selling point for me was its gorgeous appearance.  The design is reminiscent of art deco, and I love the unusual combo of salmon and gold. Originally, I was torn between the pink and the mint. However, I'm so happy with this case, I'm going to treat myself to the mint, as well."
"I love this band!  I was looking for something to help me track my activity and keep me motivated to lose weight.  The notifications are appropriate, the information is very detailed, and the band is extremely easy to use.  I have easily made a &#34;team&#34; of other users.  It tracks my sleep, steps, & level of activity without any effort and you can also track what you eat, water consumed, and measurements on the app.  I bought the first edition because it was under $50!  Love it!!"
Product exactly as described. Very happy with purchase.
"This is the first time that I have purchased from this seller but I would do so again. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I'm a pro/con list kind of girl, so this is what I have to say about the iPhone 6s clear case with two screen protectors;<br /><br />CON;<br />1. I do not like the way that the screen protectors attach to the phone, I could not for the life of my get them to sit correctly.<br />2. You can see all of the dust and fingerprints on the back of the clear case.<br />3. If you do drop your phone, leaving any dents, this will not hide them like typical cases will/<br /><br />PRO;<br />1. Great protection!<br />2. It does come with two screen protectors (and maybe I just had faulty ones, or I'm a ding-dong and couldn't figure it out {I usually have the tempered screens that attach easily})<br />3. Easily cleaned!<br />4. If your phone is a really pretty color and you want to show it off, this really gives you that option.<br />5. Great grip, doesn't slip out of your hand(s) like other cases sometimes will.<br />6. The case is easily attached and removed.<br />7. If you like to show off your kids, husband, pet(s), etc. it would be a good idea to put a photo of them on the back of your phone and then put the clear case over it."
"I applied the protector and really don't like the way it looked on my watch (see attached photo, ignore the air bubble, that was my fault from multiple removals and reapplies). I didn't know that it would not adhere up to the corners. I realize that it is not the screen protectors fault but a matter of the watch design. I took it off after a few hours."
Design looks good..but cannot use as a protective case..
"Holds the phone tight and stays on steady on the windshield. The iPhone 6 Plus fits well. Used this on a 28-hour round trip over the holidays so I could use Waze, and it didn't falter the slightest. She is minimal too, even with the arm extend almost to its maximum. This is a great device if you want to easily see your phone's screen. I have now replaced my Garmin GPS with this setup. Highly recommended!"
Definitely wasn't worth the money that a paid for it. After a day of using the case the built in screen protector came unsealed from the case. So now the least amount a water gets under the case. A waste of my money
Did not like it.  It took sooooo long to charge.
needs to be LCD screen included and not just the touch screen. The LCD broke way to easy.
Works great.  I keep my work security badge in it so that it's handy when I need to get through security doors and gates.  Much easier than keeping it in my wallet or on a lanyard around my neck.
"This was the first case I had ever purchased for an iPhone; therefore, I was not sure what to expect. The case has lasted me several months and has protected the iPhone from multiple heart-stopping falls. The only reason I did not give the full 5-star rating is due to the screen protection of the phone. The rubberized material does not hug the phone perfectly but instead only graces the outer edges of the screen portion of the phone. However, overall, I am quite satisfied with this product."
"This is a pretty little case that fits perfectly, is easy to take on and off the phone and has a nice feel.  The case comes with a plastic screen protector that is also easy to apply."
"I ordered this case 2 days ago and it was shipped really quickly, which I appreciate! I love this case. The color is so vibrant and the case is not bulky at all. This case is amazing for such a cheap price. Defiantly considering buying the pink one!!"
Nice band at first then after 3 weeks my watch fell off my arm. The attachment that held the band to the watch bracket broke.
The only drawback is that the cord is slightly shorter than the original one. Otherwise 5 stars. I'd rate this 4-1/2 if half stars were available - I would buy this product again.
Okay... so this thing is awesome! I even have a protective decal on my surface to prevent scratches. This thing stuck right to it! Totally worth every penny!
"Just received my Otterbox iPhone 6 Plus Case.  While I've always appreciated the high quality and protection Otterbox offers, I've often not used them or stuck with them in the past just due to the extra bulkiness of the cases.  However this case is no where near as bulky as some in the past have been, but still offers great protection.  Also comes in a nice variety of colors.  The case fits very snuggly, it is a bit difficult getting on, and does seem initially to be a small gap between the rubber inside case and the hard outer shell, however other reviews have noted that the gap has decreased with time, so Im anxious to see.  It's not a HUGE negative for me by any means.  I am very pleased with this case.  Great protection of phone in a less bulky case.  Great job Otterbox."
Installed as instructed did not spread like it showed to stick and have a few areas on the outside that are noticeable. The prep pad that came with it was dry and useless but the screen responds as normal and the hardness of the protector should prevent pocket snags from the little areas not attached properly. As far as screen protectors go this one was the easiest to install and packaged very well.
"Got the black version of this at a local electronics retailer for a lower price (and no shipping), found it to be average. The buttons are WAY too small for one finger operation, esp. with a thumb. The voice prompt is good, though oddly, British accent. It pairs and links VERY quickly, good use of BT4. Sound quality is okay, but I'm not the best judge as I'm not an audiophile. My main complaint? Cable length and control placement.<br /><br />Being this design, this means the control &#34;pod&#34; is sitting just below your right ear (or left, depending on your preference), and reaching up to wire, feel down to find the pod, then feel around for the button is... ARGH! Almost exasperating. And while the pod is light, it does weigh SOMETHING against your ear. Then, because you tugged on the controls, due to short cable length, you'll just &#34;pulled&#34; against your other ear.<br /><br />And depending on how you place the wire (under the chin, or behind the neck?) the microphone may or may not be able to pick up your voice clearly. Your instinct would be to put it behind your neck, but it should go under your chin, so the pod is just below your jawbone.<br /><br />It does NOT have any &#34;stabilizers&#34; or such for the earpieces other than 3 sizes of ear tips. So it's not strictly a &#34;sports&#34; headset.<br /><br />Battery life is as advertised... It lasted many many hours for me listening to podcasts. There's a minor issue that the charge port is VERY hard to open, but I guess that's necessary for that IPX5 rating.<br /><br />All in all, this is a decent BT headset if you can stand the tiny controls and the layout. It may not be for you if you do rigorous exercise and needs a &#34;stay-in-ear&#34; solution."
"The shipping was great the case is not.<br />It doesn't fit the phone properly so you can't use the charge port, silent button and the volume buttons are really sensitive. The design is also a lot better looking online than it is on the actual case. Very disappointed. I contacted seller waiting for a refund."
One of the two cables broke. Merchant did not even bother to reply.  merchant also has a bait and witch strategy. How nice to sell a product and then stop selling it so no complaints can be lodged (10 ft cable) and the cable can then be sold under a new account.
I can finally keep my phone screen protected by this great purchase I made. They really take care of the customers. As an added bonus I got a huge discount too just by leaving a fair review. I'm happy!
I love this case for several reasons! It is easy to put on and it gives me piece of mind. I am accident prone and I drop things alot.. This holds up well. I love the silicone and the kick stand. It has came in handy for when I bake in the kitchen and reading recipes on my tablet.
"Great Radar Detector!  A few days in and it's making automated adjustments to eliminate false readings, really cool.  Also, someone appearently stole the first one off my porch but Amazon made it right with no questions asked.  I recommend buying directly from Amazon!!!"
"This is a great case. I love that is makes my phone so slim. It is as if there is not even a case on it. My favorite color is pink so it looks so nice with my white Galaxy Phone. It fits perfect snapped on quickly. Anti-scratch soft case. and  cover is Impact Resistant.<br /><br />Clear Red, Clear Grey, Clear Blue, Clear gold and Clear are the colors Collen offers. I also have the clear and love them both. It is so nice to have a nice slim case than a bulky case that is heavy. I received this case complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own."
It works. Went out to the ocean and pool with it. No water ever got in. Only once water did enter but that was because it wasn't close properly. But not enough to damage the phone. Great investment!
"The Incipio IPhone 6 blue case is very strong and durable. I tend to drop my phone a lot so personally, I, am always looking for a good case to work with. I have gone through a lot of cases which have either broken on impact or when dropped, it doesnt protect the phone itself and my screen has been cracked. This has happened many times to me with other phone cases but not this one. I have had this phone case for a couple months now and noting has been wrong with it. Very strong and durable. It also protects your pone very well. I would highly recommend buying!"
"I felt the need to write a review on this product as it has performed well, and above my expectations. First let me say that this case is as beautiful as the pictures show online. The color is spot on. At least for my computer. It's a beautiful muted pink. The gold part is a fuzzy gold, not shiny. It can be a bit slippery when holding at first, but when your hand heats a little it becomes a bit more grippy. I plan on getting a gorilla glass for the screen, so I haven't as yet to see whether or not fitting the case on with the glass will be an issue. It is a very snug fit. The volume button works fine, the ports are easily accessible. The power button however is a bit hard to deal with. You really have to press down hard to make it do anything. Like taking a screen shot can be frustrating at times, but really not a big deal for me and not enough to deduct a star. When thinking of purchasing this cover, I have always had Otter Box covers for my phones and was never disappointed with them. But they just were not stylish enough for me. I love love love how this case looks. When using the Otter Box cases in the past, I was never worried about dropping my phone ( and I drop my phone a lot) I just knew Otter Box would protect it. When considering this case, I was worried. I have had this case on my new Galaxy S6 for a bit more than a month and have dropped my phone 3 times already. Now these weren't small minor drops like sitting and it falls out of my pocket onto carpet. These were hard drops. Once removing it off the kitchen counter and twice from being in hand. Once dropped on concrete and twice on hard wood floor. All three times my phone has not simply dropped. When I feel it slipping I tend to try to feverishly catch it making it bounce in the air and making it fall even harder. Most times it will fall from about 5-6 feet and bounce on the floor 2 or three times. All three time it has impacted on a corner and landed screen side down. NO DAMAGE!!! Not even to the case. No scratches at all. This case is really really much better than I expected. It keeps clean as well. After a month there are no signs of even a bit of discoloration from fade of handling or dirt (general hand grime). If I could give it more stars I would. For the money, This is an excellent case."
"Came to me on time. The LG HBS-750 work fine.<br />Sound great. When pairing u see the HBS-750 come up on your phone. Don't forget to tuch the simble on your phone.or it won't pair.when u tuch it it will turn from black to blue. Then the head set will start blinking. Thay sound great. Their just like the 69.00 dollor pair I broke. But only cost me 45.30 ,give or take some change."
"I would advise anyone who is looking for a decent phone mount to stay away from this one. The product does not work as intended. The magnet is way too weak. If you try to mount this on your dashboard, the weight of the phone will cause it to touch the dashboard. If you live in California or any other area where the weather is extremely warm all the time, the car temperature will cause the iphone 6 to overheat, thus making this a product useless. I ended up only using this during the nighttime and even then, this freaking mount broke after 2-3 months of use! I assume it got overheated on the dashboard one too many times and it cause the joint to pop off. I can't even return this product."
problems that i have had is that the rubber comes off the hard plastic easily and the stabd broke within a month. My daughters have these and they have saved the tablet when they dropped it.
This case does not fit the s5 the power button is made in the wrong place I would not recommend the case to anyone and I'll never order another trident. I would give this 0 stars but you have to have one to post a review.
This item is very sturdy and well worth the price! Thank you!
Great for my mini van and multiple uses at once.
"Received in a timely manner and utilized already.  Only beef is not with anyone but Garmin, as the screen fades very much when there's the least bit of light/daylight on it.  Went to the section and changed the screen setting from Garmin USA to England/UK (I think) and it's a bit more vibrant.  Our old one still had a better looking screen.  I'd probably look around and test them out before purchasing.  But this dealer was great!"
the case arrived very quickly. was everything as describe fit well no problems working screen with built in screen protector
Works perfectly with my Samsung Note Pro 12.2.  The image quality is excellent.  I followed the directions on the product page and it worked immediately.
i have had this for around 3 days and the sound is just as good as some bose headphones i used for a little while. The sound canceling is pretty good for 30 bucks. the only major problem is that they start to hurt my ears after about 20-30 minnuets of use. overall great value an i would buy it again.
"Got this for my 13year old daughter's Iphone 5s to protect her screen.  She also has SPECK phone cover.<br /><br />At her school they are not allowed to use their phones, so her phone is in her backpack all day.  She cracked the screen on her old phone while it was in her bag.  The crack was in the middle of the screen.<br /><br />After having this cover for nearly 4 months the cover is has good seal on the edges.  The biggest key is to make sure to clean the screen and lay it down perfectly correct to start with.  The great thing about this screen protector is it acts just like the phone screen, and doesn't require extra pressure."
"This product for your Samsung Galaxy S5 cell phone screen is the Greatest thing I have ever seen, it works just like it says and so durable, not like the ones that are so static and yaw can't get it on your phone. This is much thicker and NO BUBBLES!! Its is the Best by far!! Thanks Tech Armor...."
"This is without a doubt the best stylus for the money that I have found.  French Bull knows how to make and market a good product.  Go get yourself a couple of these little gems, they will not dissapoint you."
"We purchased two of these for a jet skiing trip. We were able to hang them around our necks and tuck them into our life jackets. It was not uncomfortable at all. The seal works very well and our phones/other items stayed dry. We were able to store our cell phones, IDs, credit cards and one car key in them. The touch screen on your phone does work while inside the case. We did take cell phone pictures with them, some of them came out a little foggy while other photos came out perfectly. All in all, a great purchase and you can't beat the price."
"This Bluetooth headset is lightweight and stylish in design. The audio quality is good and other party can hear me quiet well even with windows down. They do hear the wind noise because they're no noise cancellation on this headset. The battery lasted a long time, over a week using it on and off already and I haven't have to charge yet. The variety of clip and ear pieces gives various fitting option, although I found the earpieces work well for me without additional support."
Ordered a selfie stick. Product so bad seller didn't want it back.
ARE SERIOUS??????  WORST IDEA EVER!!!! (UNLESS YOU WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY COP)
"Love this! I use the fish eye all the time, both front and back cameras. Kinda wish I could've just bought the fisheye since I barley use the other two though"
"Really more of a thicker &#34;skin&#34; than a &#34;case&#34; as it says in the description. Nonetheless, it's perfect for my use as I keep my phone in the inner pocket of my suit coat."
"Lightweight and form fitting, easy to recharge the iPhone. Very good value compared to competition."
So I bought this product last year and I literally just came back to review this product again for the secound time. This secound time. When I received it it was dead so I charged it and it wouldn't hold a charge. I contacted the seller and told them about it and described how it was being defective and I told them I have had the product before. I know all the tricks and watnot and they waved me off and said to keep charging it that's it. The battery still til this day Dosent hold a charge and it dies even when fully charged the power button gets stuck & it's completely fustrating. I'm disappointed in this purchase. I came back to repurchase because I misplaced the first batter and as a loyal customer I said why not. So buyers beware save yourself !!!! From this headache & rude customer service.
I've been using this compact and sleek charger for over a year. I travel extensively for business and it's been a very convenient tool to have with me. This is easily the highest quality charger I've owned and would recommend it to anyone that needs a portable outlet.  It could charge my Nexus 6 maybe 3 times or more before I have to recharge the charger?
Great price
"Great quality product, surpassed only by the customer service provided."
my voice does an echo in my celphone and in the phone of the person I talk to. I give them away...
I bought 10 of these to replace my old charger cables. Typically free cables that come with the phones are cheap and the slightest pressure on any side will eventually degrade it to where it doesn't want to charge unless the cable is pulled a certain way. Not so with these.... These cables are heavy duty and can take a beating!
Didn't fit the phone and I was never refunded either
"What a great size!  I can use this to replace the iPad charger and iPhone charger I usually travel with, and still have two ports for headphone recharging."
Exactly what I needed (short length) and it's not a cheaply made product like most other cables.
Didn't quite fit my phone which caused it to break easily.
"I have a rather bulky, real wood case, and it still fits. That's really impressive. However, I am concerned that with regular use the armband will sustain damage from the bulky case going in and out. It's made from a spongy material that I'm afraid will tear at the entry point. Even so, these armbands are pretty cheap so it wouldn't be bad to replace."
"Great cover that protects the phone, shows off the beauty of the design and is exactly what I was looking for! (Also bought a red one for fun.)"
Got one in the kitchen and another on my work desk.  Got a 3rd set for the sister.  Great for watching movies when waiting for something to happen.
Arm band is a little small but still workable. This is the only reason it didnt get a 5. Add an extra inch and it would be perfect.
A very nice case with a great design. It is a hard case and very protective affording a nice grip.
"Works pretty well, and the case makes the phone very easy to hold. Case could be a little more durable."
I was given a discount on this product to review!!! Great product very fast charging
Highest in quality for cords. Better than the cords supplied by Apple. They are durable and will last .
Not the case i thought it was. Pretty much a case  that does me no good.
Great case for my Galaxy S6.  I would definitely buy this again. Of course I have not dropped my phone on the two weeks since I bought it to know that it is worth it!  I was hesitant when considering this case as it looks in the pics like the camera lens protrudes out past the thickness of the case. But it does not. The case is thick enough that the lens does not touch when you lay the phone on its back. The case went on easily and is snug and feels solid. And looks great. 5 stars.
"Works like a charm, charged my iPad and still had over 50% capacity.  Could have charged my phone too."
"Fit perfect and seemingly indestructible. It doesnt affect sensitivity.i have an,otterbox defender w a built in clear plastic screen protector and the sensitivity is still not affected with both screen protectors in use."
fits great. it is pearl and so beautiful. ( I am a male and this thing is stunning on my wife's phone)
This is a quality wallet case. I've sadly dropped my phone a handful of times since i purchased this case but the case has held up really well. My only concern is that with one of the drops the phone actually came out of the case after hitting the floor.
"My first GPS was a Garmin and I really like their mounting systems, so I was thrilled to find a mount for my phone that could attach to Garmin mounts. I've had a couple of phone mounts that are OK, but they often don't grip the phone tight enough (the iPhone 6 Plus is a little heavy). This grips really well - the phone does become dislodged if I don't firmly close the mount, but as long as I'm careful it works well."
Great quality lightning cables. And you get two for the price of 1 ($9.99).<br /><br />I bought these because I wanted longer cables and had trouble with other cables being recognized by the apple devices.<br /><br />These have worked flawlessly so far. Would recommend.
"Case looks great on the phone. Took it on vacation and got it wet several times and my phone was fine. However, I did not actually Tahoe it completely under water. I'd give it a higher rating but the charging port is too small for any of my lightning chargers, Apple included. It's inconvenient to take the case off every time so that's a big disappointment."
"These are 5&#34; speakers, the ones in my car were 5 1/4&#34;, I knew that before I bought them, but I wanted plain mids to go in my door as the highs are mounted higher and separate, I used a bit of metal strapping that was pretty thick to support 1 corner and fastened 2 other corners, leaving only one side not fastened.  The speakers (for cheap ones) sound great.  Would buy again....  heck thinking of buying a set for my truck as they are blown also....  The Magnets are HUGE on these, nearly as large as the speaker just FYI  so they fit pretty tight.."
The quality is really good.  The only problem for me was  the connector moves by 10 % down on brisk walking.  It is slightly loose.  Not holding tight with the watch.  The gold plating and finishing is really good.
Product does not work. save yourself the time and frustration and buy the samsung charger. Cheaping out here really doesnt work out at all...
Convenient  and best of what's available-has phone charger port for apple & other which is neat. Sticker to adhere it to inside vehicle didn't last long- so I hope the charger last a long time b4 I drill holes in my Raptor. JaneB
I love the design but I've been using it for less than a week and the money pocket is already beginning to tear.
Excellent sound quality and features.<br />Appradio live app from the appstore works well with my Moto X and I'm able to mirror apps onto the display.<br />Also works without issue with the Axxess AWSC1.
"Well made screen protector, its hd clear and digitizer response  is perfect with it.i received this product in a discount , in exchange for my honest review."
Got it right away!  Velcro is strong. Looking forward to being active without carrying my huge iPhone 6 plus in my hands.
"Nice case,  not as protective as some, but strong enough."
Its good but i got only ine led with it<br />Tgough it say 2 when i choose to buy it
"My first one cracked from a pretty hard fall onto the phone's face,  so I sent them an email to take them up on the lifetime warranty. Customer service was amazing, and the new one arrived within a week. Both times, I had no trouble installing the screen protector, and it looks and feels great. I wish this company made tempered glass screen protectors for the PS Vita."
Perfect.
"So far I really like this case. It fits snug to my phone and doesn't add any bulk to it. I can still carry my phone in my pocket without any problem.  I haven't dropped my phone in water, nor do I plan to, so I cannot be 100% that this is completely waterproof but as far as I can tell, after performing the waterproof test before using on my phone, there is no way that water will be able to actually get into the phone if the user properly installs it.<br />The only thing I don't like about the case is the clear back. It's more of a visual thing for me and I suppose it could be resolved with one of those cute phone stickers. I will use this case often though."
"the case fits ok but you can see tinker bell, the words are blurry, and peter pan is almost completly cut off"
"I absolutely love this smart watch!  I used the Garmin Vivosmart for a year.  I wore it almost 24/7 and it worked fantastic.  The battery life was great plus it was nice and light so I didn't even notice I had it on.  I came across the Vivoactive and after watching a few videos, I had to upgrade to it.<br /><br />The Vivoactive is the perfect smartwatch.  It's nice and light with a very thin body.  It's not as small as the Vivosmart but I can still wear the Vivoactive 24/7 and not realize I have it on.  The display is beautiful on it.  It's not using a cellphone style display like other smart watches but that's a bonus.  I previously owned the LG G Watch R and the Samsung Gear S.  Both had great displays but what really limits them is the battery life.  I already have to charge my phone once a day.  The last thing I want to do is charge my watch once a day as well.  The Vivoactive claims 3 weeks on a single charge and I think that is pretty accurate.  I've had it for 2 weeks now and have kept the bluetooth on the entire time.  I'm still at 28% battery life.  There were a couple large firmware updates when I first powered it on so that dropped my battery 8% right in the beginning so I think 3 weeks is definitely attainable.  I'd be happy with just 1 week battery life so 3 weeks is a dream come true.<br /><br />The display on the Vivoactive is fantastic in the brightest sunlight.  You can have the sun starring right at it and it's clear to read.  In low light conditions it's a little more difficult to see but it has a back light button like any standard watch.  I'm very happy the screen is on all the time.  I absolutely hated my G Watch R with the screen off until I turn my wrist.  The annoying part of other cellphone style smart watches is the screen turns on when you flip your wrist.  The problem comes in when you're driving at night and the screen comes on and off randomly...major distraction.  You wont have that problem with the Garmin Vivoactive.<br /><br />Everything is there that I loved about the Vivosmart.  Steps, calories burned, miles walked, sleep tracker, notifications, a movement bar and more.  The faces are changeable and many of them display everything I just listed on one page.  The touch screen is very good.  I have not had any problems with it.  I also like how you can pick the workout you're about to do right from the watch screen.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for the Garmin Vivoactive!thing is there that I loved about the Vivosmart.

Very sturdy case!!! Will Definitely be hard to take off the phone so this case is great for people who are looking to keep the case on for a while. If you are those people who replace cases every other week this will be hard to take off! It does not look cheap at all. Love how I am able to press all the buttons with no problem!
"My husband and I both got these phones, so far so good. We aren't having any problems. The issues that other people brought up aren't even happening with us. We use them with straight talk and the easiest way we found to switch them over was with the bring your own phone activation kit, took me less than 5 minutes with no issues. I definitely recommend this phone."
DO NOT BUY! The item shipped is significantly different from the advertised picture.  Screen protector came in different envelope and does not match the phone. The issue that I have is that the ridges are tall unlike the ones that are advertised.  Also: No Stylus Touch.
I found to be very cheap and hard to use and actually have it as a spare only.  It dosen't retract easily and gets frustrating to use on a regular basis but at the price great as a back up
I bought this and received a discount on my order for a fair review and I loved it.
Nice charger.  Bought as a replacement for an Apple iPad charger that I lost. Works very well for my iPad and iPhone.
"I really liked this charger when it was working! But, unfortunately, after only 4 short months the top port (2.4A) no longer works at all when I insert the USB plug. The bottom two ports are still working, but the top is done for. :("
"Works - lasts quite a while - dependable. Okay, maybe I'm being a bit brief.  But what can you say? Bought two batteries and they work fine - very satisfied."
I've purchased three of these so far.  Love how the stand is adjustable.  Build quality is excellent. A solid product overall.
"Perfect case, fits great, arrived as described."
"This case does the job. I like that it's not bulky. Press the standby button on the side of the phone before closing the case. If you just close the cover before pressing the button, the battery is drained out really fast."
These are not very high quality - one of the two pairs I bought has sound only in one earphone.
"Worked great until it stopped working on a recent trip.  I used this battery pack only occasionally but I really liked it when I knew I was going to be out of the house a lot and my phone battery wasn't going to be able to make it the whole day.  Used it to top off the phone battery when it was getting low.  However this past week, the battery pack would show full charge and then shortly after plugging in my phone it would drop to one &#34;bar&#34; for a bit and then go dead and not do anything.  Plugging it in to charge it back up it would return to showing &#34;all green&#34; &#34;full bars&#34; of charge again, only to not really work.  So this battery pack didn't last 6 months of occasional use.  I'd recommend checking out on of the may other options out there."
"I gave this item 3 stars only because as far as what it states, it's waterproof, dust proof, snow proof, and shock proof. It's all those things. Unfortunately, it is not designed for an iPhone 5. It may work for a 5s or even  a 5c but it is of the case for a 5. I wlill be returning it and purchasing an otterbox for $5 more. My BF has this case for his iPhone 6 and loves it. So great case but just not for the 5. :("
"Fell apart, too many small parts, waste of time."
The case is really slim and rugged. Love the color!
I bought this for my iPhone 6 and the cord is not compatible with that phone so save your money and buy a different one I really liked that it lit up but it doesn't work to charge the phone
This is good for charging your cellphone quickly. It's small size is a definite plus for when you have to travel and know that sometime you will have to charge your phone.
"This is a good camera.<br />By that I mean the video and sound quality are good.<br />Better than my rearview mirror dash cam.<br />If you are using it as a dash cam it is best if you have a car that energizes the cigarette lighter only when the ignition is turned on and off.<br />If the cigarette lighter is on all the time, then you will have to turn the camera on and off overtime you get in the car. and get out of the car.<br />The &#34;firmware&#34; file is what controls all of the settings of the camera.<br />IT is a big learning curve for MAC users.<br />You have to use the text file to alter the settings.<br />If you are a PC user it is easier once the &#34;firmware &#34; file is set up you will not have to mess with it.<br />So if you are using it as a DASH CAM.... order it as a dash cam. Not a action camera or sport cam.<br />You can change it with the &#34;firmware&#34;  of the mobius to fit your usage of the camera but it is a hassle.<br /><br />It comes with no instructions.<br />The best online help is the Mobius support help which is RC model people using it for drones."
It was easy and felt strong with all the necessary equipment to take care of the dust that lingers around before applying to the device. People complain about it cracking well don't bend the fn thing. Its thick and hardly leaves any smears. Super satisfied and thanks.
ONE OF THE LED LIGHTS @ END OF CORD WENT OUT AFTER 1 DAY OF USE. THIS CHARGER IS CRAP.
Only had it a week but it seems like it will be a great case.  I like the built in screen protector and the fact that it doesn't hide the phone.  The case seems to be very durable and will protect it without the bulk.  It has bumpers and a lip around the screen.
Good quality cable without having to pay for the apple name.
"Worked like a dream. Batteries arrived with no charge, but after charging overnight, my iPhones no longer die after 30 minutes of use!"
Defective both phone lightly dropped after installing and they broke everything was installed correctly lcd cable dosen't make great connection won't sit in place. Won't buy from this seller ever again  Buy at ur own risk
Arrived on time.Work very well with no bubbles.Just Great.
I am no stranger to after market car speakers however I do not keep up with all the current &#34;fashion styles&#34; of '' car speakers.  That having been said I would consider these speakers to have a serious design flaw in that the included &#34;grill&#34; (if you can call it that) does nothing to protect the most vulnerable part of any speaker....the woofer.  The grill only protects the mid-range driver and tweeter.  To me this is a serious design flaw.  Grill-less speakers might be fine as studio reference speakers but not in a car setting where they can get kicked in the door location or things can drop on them in the rear mount location.  As soon as I opened the box I said out loud......&#34;You have got to be kidding&#34;.  I think speakers like these could ONLY be sold by mail as anyone looking at them in the store would skip over them due to this silly lack of grill protection.  If you want your speakers to last do not buy these &#34;cool&#34; looking speakers and instead buy speakers with full grills that a made to protect your investment.
This application of a thin piece of glass to your phone is truly what I have looked for as the plastic covers were a disappointment with the scratches and scuffing. Try the Spigen glass cover and you won't go back to the plastic
The case wasn't what I was expecting. The screen cover/protector always sticks to the screen leaving this mark that makes the screen hard to see in the day light. Overall it saved my phone from many chances of breaking so 3 stars. It does its job.
Best charger cord I've had.  Very heavy with sturdy ends.  I plan to order some for my Grandkids.
"I purchased this USB charger for my recent trip to Haiti. There are many times I don't have access to power of any type, and I needed a way to charge my phone and other devices at all times.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Lightweight and fairly small<br />* Two charging ports<br />* Easy &#34;on&#34; method - shake and it's ready<br />* Long charging life - I was able to get three full cell phone charges out of this in one charge<br />* Sturdy aluminum case - very rugged<br /><br />CONS:<br />* It is slightly bigger than I had hoped, but with that said, it was the perfect size for travel<br /><br />This is a great charging device for the money. I would highly recommend this for anyone who travels a lot, or those with limited access to electricity. Besides...who wants to fight people at the airport for the limited charging stations and wall sockets!"
I'm using this unit for a week now .great fast charging on galaxy note2 BUT I don't feel its real 15600 Amb capacity.  It charge note2 for 3 times then the 4th blue light start flashing . Note2 battery is 3100 amb only.
not as shown.. no cover on front..Not like a wallet at all.
I love the case color and the material it is made of. It does protect your phone if like me you are prone to dropping. The only thing I don't like about it is that it seems to cause a problem with hearing people on the other end.
This is a great product and my second charger.  It charges both my phone and Ipad at the same time
This case has saved my phone many times..dropped it 3 times today alone..writing review on it now so its well worth the money
Great product!
"After having the original pebble for a year and half I decided to give this overpriced watch a try. I'll make it short, the color display is a top perk but most apps out there only use two colors so you aren't going to find any app that lights up your screen. What made me return this device in under a week was the way apps are loaded, streamed through the phone on the Internet meaning needs a Internet connection to work. .........What in the sam hel. Yep I went to the getpebble forums and user informed me that most of the apps are not stored on the watch like the original pebble. If your phone isn't nearby you can forget about changing apps. One more thing that bugged me, when you try to switch apps you get a loading image, followed by &#34;failed&#34; 9 times out of 10. The loading symbol is where it's trying to stream a app from the phone. There is more stuff I could go on about but this suppose to been a short review, for $200 this isn't worth it.<br /><br />Oh forgot to add for most people wrist the standard pleather band will leave a mark on your wrist. For my wrist it was hard to find a soft tight spot where the watch didn't slide around"
"good product, bought on sale like half price. Rated highly on consumer reports. its thin and i believe garmin is the best in gps"
Ipod didn't work after installation but I am going to blame that on my poor workmanship.
This is my second poetic case and I got to say that they're definitely the best case for a nexus. I went with the black this time because my jeans were making my white one blue.
Love this!  Do not use in the hot Arizona Sun as it will overheat.
"This PowerGen White 4.2-Amp (20 Watt) Dual USB wall adapter is a powerhouse. I have a micro USB plugged into it to charge my external batteries, and with the other USB output I have a USB extension plugged into it with a lightning cable to charge my iPhone 5S. I haven't noticed any degeneration with the battery by charging it with a much more powerful charger, I do notice that my charges are done much quicker."
"This is the best Case for my Itouch! The color is just the same as the ads. The Itouch is completely sealed and waterproof! The screen is Scratch resistant and smudge proof. The case isn't as &#34;bulky&#34; as the fit is tight.The case is easy to snap together and another importtant feature is it can be disassembled and reassembled without damaging either the Itouch or the case! This product surpasses my experience with all the others and just $15.00. I support this product,the seller,and Amazon!MEB2;8/29/2015;10:51am"
Fits perfectly in my 05 Mitsubishi Galant. The material used is good and looks good with the back interiors. All stars..
Works well - as described.  I was worried about the sound lag which is seriously not a problem if it is noticeable at all.  the bigger deal is that you need to figure out how to hook it up to the audio out of your TV AND the USB power in a manner that is easy to take off and on when you decide to use it...
"Dropped the phone shortly after buying. Screen shattered. Phone did too. Not even a big fall. Case was fine. Screen was ruined. Not sure what failed, but it was very fragile glass."
Great phone! If you want a querty keyboard and enjoy touchscreen then this is the phone for you. Best of both worlds
This item can move around and select and open apps on android phones but DOES NOT WORK TO SELECT ITEMS WITHIN VIRTUAL VR APPS. It looks as though it is selecting the item but when clicking the X button to select something like as if you were tapping item on screen DOES NOT WORK. Don't buy this product thinking you can select items within VR apps.  The google cardboard button that is made onto the google cardboard do actually work to select items. Hope this helps. I know for a fact that I had this sunnypeak working properly because it will move around on your android phone but not within VR apps.
Poor quality  missing adhesive for screen
"It's okay for the price, but don't expect the world. You'll likely need to replace the protector after a couple three months as it gets scratched up. The anti-glare also reduces screen quality noticably, but that's normal for anti-glare. The fit is close, but not exact - the camera cutout will cover the camera if you center the protector."
"Great company.  The first one I received didn't work, which I made clear in my original one-star rating.  Anker immediately apologized and sent out a new, properly working, charger.  I couldn't have asked for the situation to be handled more professionally.  I ended up ordering 4 more.  5-stars for Anker."
"Great little Bluetooth kit for car, courtesy of Wirecutter recommendation.  I especially like the magnetic base -- made it a lot easier to switch between two vehicles I was driving. Have never had a problem with audio problems.  When on a call, people say I sound far away, but that may be due to my placement of the device more than anything, but not sure.  Summary: If You Need A Bluetooth Kit For Your Car, Get This!  -------------------------  Oct 2015 UPDATE:  After about 9 months of use, my unit developed a crack on the main button, so I emailed Hisgadget support, and they replaced the unit for  for free, plus free shipping!  -------------------------  May 2017 UPDATE:  Still use this everyday, still going strong!"
THIS DEVICE DID NOT WORK WITH MY SMARTPHONE. NOR DID IT CHARGE WHEN CONNECTED TO OTHER DEVICES. TO RETURN IT WOULD COST ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE CABLE SO WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.
"...fits correctly in my HTC one m9, the buttons works also greate, like the phone ones, you cannt tell the difference. This case appears to be part of the phone, really."
"Great case, I bought it for my 10 year olds phone, it works better than expected."
It was so nice to have the JOTO waterproof bag for my iphone.  I felt reassured that my phone was protected from the water and sand.  It worked great.  No leaking at all.  I was able to capture a lot of fun pictures of the kids swimming and also got some great shots while snorkeling.  Great inexpensive product to keep phones safe while around the water.
"This is a great product, but the only down side is that it's kind of heavy for lightweight backpacking. I get about 5 full charges on my I-phone 5 and it takes about 45 minutes for a full charge. It also comes with a carrying case."
We use this product all the time when traveling - charges fast and will charge 2 phones at the same time.  Long lasting - not sure how long as I have never had it run out of charging power.  Would highly recommend this product.
I love this arm band. It is made with good quality material. It is worth the $10 that you spend on it. And to be honest this is the cheapest and best quality out on the market.
"This should have lasted a lot longer.  I've had this unit for only three months now so,it's too late for a return. The fold out receptacle plug always seemed somewhat weak but still worked until now. I have been pretty easy on it and careful not to treat it roughly when plugging in. Now it's completely useless."
I used it to power 2 Panasonic self contained speakers used for my highs in my jeep. Nice and clear!
I have had these for several months now and really love them. It is a great length.  The work fantastic. I would recommend them to anyone.
"Although I don't like the color, the case itself is worth the money. It fits the phone perfectly, and the buttons are easy to press too. The only reason I don't like the case is because the back is clear, other than that it's a pretty good case."
"It appears large and cumbersome but will serve the purpose it was bought for.  It will not get wet, lost or stolen!"
Really nice case very smooth durable my phone drop a couple of time and no problem. The face plate is a good addition as well to this package it's a little pricey but sometimes you pay for what you get overall I am very!! Pleased with my speck .
"This was a disappointment and I replaced it after a couple of months.  It's a thick cover and I'm guessing it would have provided very good protection.  In the end, it was too thick and bulky for me.  The swivel worked fine and I did like that.  There were 2 big flaws, however.  First, the cover is held shut by an elastic strap that wraps around the back.  That might not have been too bad on its own, but the case has no cutout on the bottom edge for the USB charging port.  In order to charge my tablet, I had to swivel it 180 degrees in the case so the USB connection was on the top.  You then close the cover, secure it closed with the strap and plug it in to your charger.  If you want to check the charging status, you need to unplug the charger so you can slip off the elastic strap to open the cover.  Some people may prefer the elastic strap to magnets that other cases have.  I, however, hated it."
well designed and fits phone nicely. I ordered the medium based on arm measurement. works well on bare arm. Think I might order the larger size for fall weather over clothing.
"Very Good, i dropped it once i got it by accident, and showed no scuffing or dents,  and charged my phone really fast ;D"
Fantastic multi port power block for charging usb devices that actually works. I paired it with Anker cables and I can charge six devices at once at the highest charge rates for the devices. Great job Anker!
"This case is not the hardcore case u want to put on your phone. If u drop it a lot, this probably isn't the best case for u. While it was a little sturdier than I expected given the comments, it still didn't seem tough enough for me. Still very nice looking tho, and for the money it's worth it"
Lifeproof is the best.  All of our IPhones are protected with Lifeproofs.
This is a really fun little case! I fidget and being able to play with the case is a great way to help with my nerves. Although I received this case at a discounted price in exchange for a review the case is a very good deal.
"I have trouble getting the phone in the case it was way too tight, I have to use the butter knife to get it in which leads to dent and scratches on my phone.  This is a major design  flaws."
The case cover would go on the phone however th ed pink trim didn't fit over the phone cover. The cover keep turning phone off. I would not recommend anyone to buy this cover.
"Easy install, great quality tools (magnetic heads!), and a good quality battery that charged quickly with no issues. Highly recommended for anyon who needs to repair an iPhone 5 with a dead battery."
"Without going for a mounted booster, this is hands down the best available. It's multi band support makes it versatile. It will fit nearly any phone (galaxy note 4 with case won't fit), though anything too large just needs to be held against the booster to work. Absolutely phenomenal for picking up signal in tough places."
"It looks like the more expensive ones but you can't answer the phone while it's closed.  It is ok, flimsy and not what I thought it was going to be"
"Not that great of an amp. It can barley power there own brand of speakers. I have it powering a set of MM6501 and MM651 and 1 db dvc 10&#34; sub the system dont sound goog at all , so im changing all the speakers at this time to JBLs"
works exactly as intended
Make sure your product supports quick charge. I was surprised by the short list. Works great as a standard charger if not however.
"This case does not feel like it will survive a hard impact but is very cute. Fits my phone perfectly , with a slight lip on the front side. Have yet to drop while in this but it does not offer much protection. Received this product at a discounted price for my honest review."
Very disappointed to find that the case fits very loosely on the top part of the phone. The screen protector is also very cheap. I would also prefer a case that covers the entirety of the phone but that's a minor complaint. Wouldn't recommend this unless you don't care if you have a mediocre case for your phone.
"This case is very durable, I phone dropped from the top of the fridge and it's like brand new."
"I bought this despite the one star reviews because I love the design, and needed a true hot pink waterproof band.  I LOVE it.  Yes, it is tight to get on.  Maybe that doesn't bother me, since I knew it before purchase.  It does have a tiny amount of stretch.  I would describe my hands as smaller.  I wear the Apple Sport band, large, on the second hole for heart rate, and the third hole (from the end) for casual wear.  The Case-Mate band fits perfectly.  Not too tight, not too loosely.  I can fit two fingers underneath it.  The band is thick and chunky and perfectly proportioned for the watch.  The material is a little less silky than the Apple Sport band, but not in a cheap fashion. The color is very true hot pink- less toward the orange end of the spectrum, more toward the fuchsia end.  There are no manufacturing defects from molding (the design is intricate) - it is perfect.  When removing it, because of the tight fit, I have to go slowly and carefully.  In summary- I am extremely pleased with this band, and it is an excellent value."
"So far so good. I could not give it 5 stars simply because the construction is not all there. It rotates very easily which i didn't like and i can see where the ball in socket design would wear out quickly.  Once i figured out how i wanted it mounted,  i unscrewed the socket mount and put a dab of contact cement in there.<br /><br />It works well for my samsung s6 edge+ with an incipio case. A dab of white lithium lube on the tracks helped with the sliding gripper arm.<br /><br />The suction is great but the rotating face is too loose. I may figure out a better way to secure that as well.<br /><br />For less than 10 bucks, how can you go wrong?"
"Battery exploded and ruined my dash. It was 94 degrees outside, came into my melted dash cam."
"Bought this in baby blue (without the headphones),just a great item and delivered on time! Better than others out there! Completely recommended!"
That's  was  perfect for me because all of  my friends love it  this product is really  amazing  thanks .
Put this in the car and I can use hands free for school zones and stuff with my Andriod.  I really have used the heck out of this and it will help me from have a ticket or having a wreck. Great product need to get one for my son who is stubborn about texting and driving.<br /><br />I purchased this product at a reduced price to facilitate this review but was not compensated in any other way.
"Works great, the only thing I noticed was that it was possible that a radio station could over power the signal of this device.  I was driving along, everything is working fine, then I notice a radio station signal starting to overpower this device, it becomes so bad that I have to change the channel of the radio receiver and the Alpatronix device.  Therefore, (using the inverse square rule) this device must not have hardly any radiated power.  So, everything is great, you might have to change the channel when you are driving long distances and come across radio stations that are on the same band.  Other than that, it is a great device.  I am very happy I bought it."
"This is a good product for the money. The black rubberized portion does separate from the hard plastic (blue) portion, but my 12-year-old son says that he enjoys the process of snapping it back, where I would find that annoying. Other than that little flaw, this is a great phone cover and my son loves it!"
"Have purchased for my sons phone in the past and it works great, so I bought one for my husbands phone."
Fits as promised and I love the change of color from the original silver to this electric teal. All cutouts well thought out and screen fully protected. Would certainly buy again.
[[VIDEOID:fbd77b74d4260e988b0333c9ce57cac8]] If there is one thing i love it is external chargers. Personally I have a ton of portable chargers so I have experience with high quality and low quality chargers. After testing out this charger i have to say it was definitely of high quality.It has a massive battery and is a must buy! Watch my video attached to see a in-depth video!
"These cases suck, I followed the exact steps yet water somehow leaked to my phone so DO NOT BUY THESE"
"Works as advertised. The only down side, which I knew before buying, was that if you use ANT+ HRM you have to turn off Bluetooth. This is more of an annoyance than anything else, saving $250 from purchasing a Fenix 3 is worth it to me. The Fenix 2 been a fantastic watch the month I have owned it, nice cheaper alternative to those who can't afford a Fenix 3"
I never write reviews but this was amazing I brought it to miami and I was by the pool and I dropped my phone face doen and when I picked up my phone it looked like the screen was cshattered but it was actually the screen protector  that was cracked and my iPhone 6 was completely safe love this just reordered
"got here 1 week earlier, very happy with the case itself"
"Truly plug-n-play on Windows 7.  It quickly found its own drivers and installed without issue.  Worked just fine after I removed the antenna and turned up the volume (as the manual suggested).  Downloaded a virgin copy of the image to my hard drive for future reference, then put together my own image and sent it to radio (UV-82HP).  Will clone on the other radios I just ordered.  Worth the money for the piece of mind and lack of hassle."
"An alright case, but cheaply made. It is almost as big as an otter box but is not made with the same quality of materials. However, the price is pretty good. I bought a much lighter- weight case with this one and find myself using that one much more(JETech® Apple iPhone 5/5S Case Bumper Shock-Absorption Bumper and Anti-Scratch Clear Back for iPhone 5/5S (Black)<br /><br /> I tend to put this one on when I do yard work, go to practice, etc."
Great case just a little hard to use side buttons.
"It works great, there's not too much static and the sound is louder than other transmitters I've had in the past. I've spent $60 on other models and this one is better than all of them combined. I'm very satisfied with this product!"
6' is awesome.  The cable is nicely made and seems heavy duty compared to the Apple cable.
Looks nice. True it does not look cheap. But definitely not a fast charger. My phone dies and when I plug it up to charge my phone it takes about 40 mins to have my phone turn back on. Changed the charger to a charger I bought at Wall Mart for $20  and in 5 mins my phone turned on and said it was at 12%. Its not a fast charger.
"this phone looks good but that's all it offers.. if your looking for a phone just to make calls then this phone is for you, if your into apps and all that fancy stuff then this phone is not for you."
This is a copy of the Mopie extended battery pack! It didn't even fit my phone!<br />It was returned!!!
2005 Honda Pilot perfect fit. Screw that came with it were too short. Went to Lowes and bought 1/2 inch sheet metal screws and they worked just fine.
Speedy delivery from seller. Nice product to use for your doll display!
"I really enjoy this case, especially the port cover that protect my headphone jack and Lightning cable port.<br /><br />I used to use a case w/o port covers, and got a ton of dust in there that eventually shorted out my iPhone.<br /><br />The case could have a little more grip to it, but overall it's great."
Love love love this screen protector . I have had several others . This is the best ! Easy to put on and no bubbles!
"works great for charging...haven't tried sync, but i don't need a 6ft cable to sync on pc & just use the regular."
Good band; the leather is soft. The only concern I have is when sliding into the Apple Watch it sometimes gets stuck. Hopefully it will get softer with use.
"I love this case.  The kickstand is great to watch movies on.  I do not use the belt clip portion of the case but it seems like a snug fit.  Plugs are easily accessable, and buttons are easy to push.  Overall this is a great case."
"Fail, it does not come with USB 3 to 2 adapter. For me , at least, it's not going to fulfill its intended purpose. Company is falsely advertising this product, intentionally or not and it should update pictures on Amazon."
"Barely works. Had it for about a week, unfortunately cannot return it because the packaging is in the trash. It's really hard to get it to stay working and not turn on and off every two seconds."
"Works great, on star off because it interferes with Apple Pay on my device."
Has issues with GPS reception.  Would have passed on the purchased had I known that this model had this problem.
solid and did not break. nice angle on the stand received discount for review
Bought the case and the button was already loose maybe a defect? But I contact customer service and the send out a new case right away! Best customer service I dealt with. Case look awesome!
A quality case and works good for wireless charging. The case fits tightly and looks original. I'm using an Acker PowerPort Qi wireless charger and have not had any issues.
"Can't beat the price.  I order them two at a time because the clip has a tendency to break..  The clip breaks if too much pressure on it, but it is a very good holster case."
"I Love this item!  The sound is amazing and the range (away from my phone) is by far the best have gotten on a blue tooth device.  I am amazed! I have paid $$$$$ over a hundred dollars and not had near the quality.<br />The only slight draw back i have found, after wearing it for long periods it makes my ear sore.  It would truly be perfect is was not a 'hard' plastic.<br />WELL Worth the cost!!!!"
I love the one-handed design. I can easily mount the phone on the dash without having to use two hands. And it works great!
This is a great cover. I've used it for a couple of months and carry it around everywhere. Still looks brand new.  The only thing that could be improved adding a magnet to the back so that the cover would stay folded when I'm reading.
"The case fits very well, The case provides plenty of side and back protection. The qi charging works great. The phone charges very quickly when i use my Tylt VU charger."
Works great for my son's Valentine 1 we hooked up to his 2011 BMW 128i.  Very well made. Highly recommended.
This cable broke on me after about 2 1/2 weeks of use. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this adapter if they plan on using it with their phone in their pocket
This case arrive a few days early and that is a plus! I love how they put the case in a tight plastic bag. The case's design looks more beautiful than in the picture. It came with holster for a low price! I have never seen this kind ok iphone 4 case with this kind of design in stores so when I saw it here I had to get it. I am glad I got this case for my brother's iphone 4. It looks awesome on the phone. I will order more cases from this seller in the future! Thanks for an awesome case!
First of all it arrived fast. I love it! I use to store my watch & iPhone in its original box on my night stand. Once it hooked my little station up it reduced so much clutter. As for the craftsmanship I was surprised it's nicely built and its sturdy. It's attractive & neat and for the price it's great. Plus it has a lifetime replacement that's a plus 
Great OTTER Box!  Perfect condition and shipped very quickly.  Very reasonably priced.
"The audio quality is very good. These do not work good for running. The buds are fairly heavy and each step causes a &#34;thump&#34; noise in my ear.<br />As long as I am not running, no thump. I also get a bluetooth audio drop out, several times a song. This is annoying."
"Good case, fits nicely, no problems at all. The screen protector is great. Overall a very good purchase"
The ear buds were just as described. Love the color and the tangle free flat wires. The sound quality is okay but not fantastic. Honestly the ear buds that came with one of my Samsung phones have much better sound quality. These ear buds fit well. The sound quality is the only thing that would prohibit me from purchasing this item again.
...very functional with a hint of pazazz!
"As others have already said this phone is head and shoulders above any other Tracfone smartphone. I moved up to this from an LG Optimus Dynamic 2 and this phone is much more responsive and never hangs for seconds at a time as the Optimus used to. Also with almost 5 GB of free memory you can finally load your favorite apps without fear of running out of storage space.<br /><br />It's fast smooth and responsive in use and so far I have found nothing that I can point out as a drawback. Indeed it is better than the Optimus 2 in every respect especially in battery life even though it's a larger phone. The Optimus lasted 2 days at most without needing a recharge but this phone almost doubles that battery life even with an extra app or two running 24/7 in the background.<br /><br />So if you are looking to upgrade an existing Android Tracfone or preparing to dip your toes into the smartphone waters for the first time I can heartily recommend this phone, it won't disappoint you."
I love this band . I have the apple sport and the band made such a difference in how the watch looks . The rubber black band that it comes with looks so cheep . I have gotten a lot of compliments with this band . It's very comfortable. Took a little to figure out how to take the links out but with the little tool it comes with makes it really easy once you get the hang of it . Great band !!!!
I love this case so far. I've had it for about a week. It seems very strong so far. It holds up to or about 5 to 7 cards including your id. Which is perfect for me.
"I like this Galaxy S5 Case, MagicMobile Ultra Slim Fit cover fine. I honestly prefer silicone cases, but this hard case is okay in a pinch. I like to switch out my cases and covers here and there depending on my mood, so this fits into my criteria. I received this case in return for my honest review. It's a good quality case, I love the color, and it fits my T-Mobile Galaxy S5 perfectly. Thanks!"
"I have heard many reports of screens randomly shattering on Xperia devices before deciding to purchase the Z3 Compact but never thought I would experience it myself. Unfortunately I was wrong. After less than a month of use, the front glass on my Z3 Compact shattered in my front pocket. My Z3 Compact has been protected with a case from day one and has never taken any physical damage from falls of any kind. On my way to work I decided to check my email and was instead greeted with a shattered screen. Of all my years of using touchscreen smartphones, I have never experienced a device that spontaneously broke in my pocket.<br /><br />I am really disappointed that this happened to my device because before this incident I genuinely loved the Z3 Compact. Sony designed a beautiful looking device with Z3 Compact. It is small enough to use comfortably in one hand while maintaining the high end specs expected from a flagship device. The battery life easily outlasts most of the competition and I never had trouble making it to the end of the day with extra juice to spare. I was really looking forward to the Z5 Compact that will be announced later this year but I am not willing to risk another device randomly shattering in my pocket.<br /><br />The Z3 Compact is a great phone with a potentially fatal flaw. This time lady luck just wasn't on my side."
Product is what was expected for the price.<br />The people that are leaving the negative reviews seem to be comparing this package to high end products which is silly to do.
"The listing said it would keep my tablet charged while using it, but even though the tablet displays that it is getting a charge, there is no actual power going into the tablet. I left it plugged in while the tablet screen was off, and the power went from 50% to 18% overnight. So, this will not charge your tablet, but it will output video/audio through the hdmi, as long as your device still has power. I'll have to find another device that keeps my tablet charged so that I can actually use this thing without having to stop and charge it all the time."
"I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and my phone is always right there with me.  When I cook, I like to look at the recipes on my phone. With this Crawl Robot Design Flexible holder, I can hang my phone from the cabinet knob and it is at eye level.  It makes reading the recipe so much easier.  What is also nice about this holder is that I can hang my phone while it charges and the cord isn't all stretched across the counter.  This holder is strong enough to hold my iPhone and for me to carry the holder by the &#34;head&#34; with the phone still attached up the stairs and into my bedroom without falling out or slipping at all.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for<br />My honest opinion and review."
"The best case I have bought so far, fits perfect on my LG 3 nice grip in my hands it's just a perfect case!!"
"Received this product at discount for honest review.  This is a VERY sturdy cell phone case.  Easy to install, provides great protection and added screen protection for iPhone 6 plus  great deal"
Ok product. Cheap tape to mount. Needs double grounding.
everything about this thing is great... except I've only had it about 6 months and the port for the charging cable (mini usb) seems to be giving out on me already.  Iv'e got to wiggle it a bit for it to sit in there just right for it to charge.
"Great length. Great price, well made"
A great product. Crystal clear sound. Use it at gym.  Also great looking.
Just plain awesome.  This is the best phone holder out there.
This case has a nice texture to it and will offer decent protection without the bulk of other cases. The fact that it has the texture means that you will be less likely to drop it in the first place.
"DO NOT BUY!!! These are crap!! I bought two of them. One didn't even turn on and the other would not record video. Any files that it did record were corrupted. I tried with two different brand new sd cards, so i know the memory was not the problem. I know that it seems like a good price but thats because they dont work."
"This is a very high-quality, well-made, very functional multi tool. It not only charges my phone with the lit up USB port, but it has very bright LED flashlight with the strobe function built in.<br /><br />Another use I found for this external power unit is to power my Wi-Fi camera that I use on remote locations. i've used it to power my D-Link Wi-Fi camera for hours with no problem."
"Very high quality screen. Everything needed to remove the old screen and install this one was provided. I hope to never need to buy another one, but if I have to, this will be my first choice."
"Meets my needs very well, is able to hold cards, cash and phone and close secure.  Great wallet case."
"Excellent device, performs flawlessly.  I only wish I could disable the 'double-tap-to-redial-last-#' function."
"Great, arrived as described, worked perfectly"
"Nice little device. The sound is really good for it's size, and it is easy to operate. I have found that when I am in location where the radio signal is not very good, I can leave the USB cable plugged in to the radio only, and actually acts as an external antenna, and the signal improves. I don't know if this was designed for this, but it works. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because because there is no station indicator on it. You just have to listen for the station to ID itself, to know what you are tuned to."
"Great design for my daughter's case.  Not protective on the end of the case.  She dropped her phone and while it didn't break, the end got banged up.  She went back to a more secure case."
Fits our iPhone 6 fine. Easily mounts into AC vent for a snug and secure fit. Good product. Recommended. Also fits our Garmin GPS.
"This is a really great headset. It's easy to use, comfortable to wear & convenient. When using them, it's almost as if you don't know the neckband is there. They don't slide off, even when lying in bed or being physically active."
We've been using this case for a while and has held up well. The case is thin and as a very little b we've been using this case for a while and has held up well. The case is thin and as a very little bulk to the case. The case looks good and provides sufficient protection for every day use.
"This is a great little backup battery for daily style use.  While I have larger portable powerbanks for camping, we all have had that experience of a phone dying during the day right?  Enter eBoot 3000!  Slightly larger than a tube of lipstick, it's easy to have tossed in a purse or backpack without adding substantial weight.  Yes, it'll probably only charge your device once, but it'll get you through the day.  My other chargers which might get you 6+ charges are far too substantial for me to carry daily in my tiny bag.<br /><br />It comes with a cord that will charge from any USB port, but to charge a micro USB phone from the powerbank, you can use the same cord flipped.<br /><br />I have no problems letting it charge my phone in my purse, which is awesome.  If carefully arranged in my hand, I can still talk on my phone while it charges too.<br /><br />One consideration- it has a rather bright light while it's charging that flashes.  During the day, this doesn't bother me in the slightest.  If I tried to plug it in at night in my bedroom or in a hotel room, this would be intolerable to me.  As it stands now, I tend to charge it at the office while I work, so since it's never actually bothered me I'm reluctant to knock a star for that alone and because the light does serve some function to let you know if it's done charging.  I may try out masking tape, as the light is really bright so it may still show through, just more muffled.<br /><br />If anything changes with regard to my experience with the product, I will update!<br /><br />I received this product for free/or at a discount price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
"Bad Camera. Trying to be cheap so I got what I paid for. even the settings in &#34;HD&#34; it is terrible. Those videos and pictures showing excellent quality are just not true. Unfortunately they will still selling it, scan people and make money. The vendor is going to the red list. The pictures shown on my review has been enhanced, maybe by Amazon ? I don' know. The actual pictures have much less quality of the one in this review, be careful."
"Fits perfectly on iPhone 4S.  Very happy, great deal."
"It feels very high quality and much superior to plastic screen protectors. However, it does not fit the phone properly. The size is right but the edges simply wont stick. Others call this the &#34;halo&#34; effect, as you have a halo of air running all along the edges."
"Quality cable, works great and charges my iPhone 6Plus."
"I’ve been a big fan of Anker products for a while now (great battery products), and I was eager to try out their high quality Powerline micro USB charging cables. I wasn’t disappointed.<br /><br />I got the 6-ft version since I had plenty of short cables (6 in to 3 ft) in my collection already. The first thing you will notice about this cable is the build quality. The cable is a nice, thick and sturdy feeling cable. This is where the Powerline Kevlar shines. It's not one of these wimpy, flimsy cables that won't hold up to normal wear and tear. You even get two Anker-labeled velcro ties to keep the cable neatly stored. Anker is great at including little extras like this. I have thus far used this cable successfully with stock charging blocks from Samsung (Note 4), Asus (Nexus 7), Motorola (Moto X), an iPhone Mophie Juice Pack, and external batteries and charging ports from Anker and Aukey. It has worked flawlessly (full speed charging and supporting Quick Charge 2.0). The micro USB end is also designed well enough to not have a problem charging any of my devices with cases on. In contrast, the cable I got from Mediabridge would not charge my Mophie Juice Pack because it was too thick around the micro USB end. No such trouble here!<br /><br />A few situations where having a 6 ft cable is really handy? You ever get that seat in the coffee shop that’s not quite close enough to the wall outlet? No problem with six feet to work with. Also, ever sit in the back seat of a car but want to charge your phone with the car charger in the dash? No problem here. There really are situations where a longer cable is super handy and everyone should have at least one in their collection. It has earned a permanent place in my messenger bag. Easily the highest quality third-party cable I’ve ever used, and that’s saying something coming from a gadget geek.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample of this product for testing and evaluation, and my feedback and review is fair and honest."
"I WISH AMAZON HAD NEGATIVE STARS. BOUGHT THIS 4 MONTHS AGO. HAVE TRIED TO USE IT 3 TIMES, DID REALLY CHARGE MY PHONE. THOUGHT MAYBE I DIDN'T LEAVE IT IN THE SUN LONG ENOUGH SO, I PUT IT IN THE DASH OF MY CAR. ITS BEEN IN MY DASH, UN-USED, FOR 2 1/12 MONTHS. NOW IT CHARGES MY PHONE OR TABLET FOR ABOUT 1 MINUTE, THEN STOPS CHARGING. LIGHTS INDICATE A FULL CHARGE. THIS THING IS A PIECE OF CRAP. DON'T BUY THIS. IF IT WAS $10 OR $20, I WOULDN'T BE SO UP SET. I HAD HIGH HOPES. WANTED THIS TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE MY PHONE WHILE ON MY KAYAK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LOOSE KICK STAND, THIS THING IS PRETTY WELL PUT TOGETHER, BUT WON'T CHARGE MY PHONE!"
"The cable that comes with your phone is like 3 ft long, that' too long for the car, it just make your car more messy with that 3 ft of cable laying around.  But this 1 ft microUSB cable is perfect for the car and it supports Qualcomm quick charge too !"
"Bought this charger but was deffective, they sent me a replacement and it's working fine, best place to shop"
The case is heavy duty. If my phone falls I know it's ok.  Also comes with a stylus and screen protector although I didn't need those.
Deecribed as it is. Great item.
Love these cords! Don't be tricked into buying cheaper cords that really don't work or the more expensive ones that aren't necessary.
"This one was a gift but I have another larger higher capacity model that is very similar in design and it is amazing.  Mine is about twice the capacity of this one and i can charge my Galaxy S5 4 times with one charge.  Or my iPhone, 4 times as well.  I bought this one as a gift for a co-worker who went out of her way to make my job easier, and I wanted something small to fit in her purse or bag because she travels a lot. She said she had seen a lot of the guys at work with these and she wanted one and this was perfect, in size and practicality."
While the case fits nicely it doesn't stay clipped together. The rubber slips from under the hard case fairly often. I guess you get what you pay for.
This was a gift and recipient is very happy with it. It was replacing another that he had had a few years ago that was his favorite phone.
"Just got it in today.. Fast delivery. Feels great in hand, Very sleek design. Built feels Sturdy. Easy to put together. I'm going to use this case when I go out. I don't lose bars on  T-mobiles network , it just gets a Lil hot when screen is on a long time, kinda normal  for metal . Really satisfied with my purchase.."
It is not bendable and not the soft kind of case. But the case itself is sooo adorable!!!!
"This case is really outstanding in it's design, fit and value.  The case fit perfectly on my new iPhone 6+, looks great and is slim enough to keep the phone from looking like I'm putting a tablet up to my ear when answering a call...."
"This thing has a GREAT BASS. I haven't even heard that deep bass from any other headphones I've used. Even my friend's headphones that he spent 350 dollars on don't sound this good. He sure got jealous when i told him that I got a lot better product than him and I didn't even get to pay. Seller arranged everything and i was happy when i got chosen to receive this as a sample. Overall, i'm very satisfied with this and it looks like, this satisfaction has no end"
It only lasted 3 weeks before one of the buds died. That control panel doesn't work at all. The sound quality is ok but it isn't anything to get hyped about. It's not worth your 6 bucks.
"Awesome case!! Fits the galaxy s6 edge plus perfect! The gold color matches the gold phone and the case is flexible, not a hard plastic. No complaints!"
"I think runners and fitness enthusiasts will love this armband as much as I love this iPhone 6 Armband!  Inside the box includes a case and an armband.  The case is low profile and works as well as most standard cases--that is to say, it doesn't offer the protection of an otterbox, but it does save the phone from minor oops's. The case allows easy access to all the iPhones buttons and ports.<br /><br />The back of the case has a slot that allows the case to attach to the armband with a secure &#34;click.&#34; The phone is attached and has no chance of coming loose-- I tested it by doing my entire calisthenics routine with the phone attached to my arm: sit ups, jumping jacks, burpees.<br /><br />The armband is soft and is fully adjustable with a velcro band. I found that the velcro held fast through the workout.<br /><br />There are a lot of options for iPhone workout buddies. This Belkin Clip-Fit is one of the best because it is one of the easiest.  If you don't use a special case, your iPhone can rest in the case provided in the box so that you're ready to run with just a click.  Great product!"
"I wish I could give this product six stars.<br />Received it this morning today ,two day<br />Shipping, and just ordered a second one.<br />This one goes in my glove box and the<br />second will go in my wife's  glove box.<br />I have had other versions of this type of product but this is by far the best for the<br />5S that I have now at a quarter of the price I pay for others"
My kids and i loveeee this selfie stick. It works great amd has a really long arm. The only thing is that my daughter has an htc and it doea not work with her android
Do not buy this case/charger not worth the money first off the clear screen protector looks like it's made my Mattel its a pile of crap will not go on all the way the bottom sides of the protector will not stay in place it slides around and if you pull it off to many time it will not stick and get air bubbles in it. As far as the battery back up just got mine today and don't know how good it will work. Just don't expect a lot of this case or screen protector. Just my .02 cents.
If worked for like a minute then stopped. You guys want 12$ for this when I got another at Target for 4$ and it works perfectly.
One of the best Google Cardboards I've ever tried! I know it sounds absurd but this one actually works not like the others that fall apart! You can trust these guys.
Great backup battery. And a much better price than thru Samsung direct. Holds charge as well as the battery which came with the phone.
"I recently purchased the 42mm Apple Watch Sports Model. The initial Apple Watch sports band was fine, but I wanted something that looked a lot better and felt great to wear.<br /><br />After searching for a great looking band (and looking for one at a good price), my search for that type of band came to an end when I found this stainless steel metal replacement watch band sold by Leesentec. Just to let you know, I'm one of those guys who is very fashion conscience as well.<br /><br />If I'm wearing a suit, I want my watch band to look just as good if not better than my suit. If I'm wearing a polo shirt, I want my watch to go with my polo shirt. So needless to say, the plain black sport watch band that Apple included with the watch just didn’t cut it for me. I needed a band that I could wear with just about anything, but that was also very stylish to match my contemporary fashioned clothes.<br /><br />So needless to say I ordered this stainless steel wristband from Leesentec. Once I ordered the band from Leesentec, they shipped it very promptly and it also arrived very quickly. This stainless steel wristband is very flattering. It's made with excellent quality and it feels fantastic to wear it on the wrist. It's not heavy whatsoever.  With it being so light, your wrist won't fill weighed down like other watch bands can do.<br /><br />One of the main features which drew me to this band was that it already had the metal clasp adapters included on the band. This is HUGE! Just so you know if a band doesn't have the Apple Watch adapters already on the wrist band, you're going to have to go out and buy the adapters separately (that's even more money). Then once you receive the adapters, you have to use a tool kit (a lot of times the tool kit is not provided) to install the adapters. Installing the adapters is a very time consuming thing and a big pain (take it from me, I ordered some bands in the past that either didn't have the adapters with the band or it had them, but they were just not installed on the band - I hated having spend more money to buy the adapters and then installing them on the band - It was a tedious thing to install and an utter waste of my time!!!).<br /><br />Well, Leesentec eliminates the need to buy and install the adapters. Since they're already installed them, once you take the Leesentec wrist band out of the box, it's ready to be used!<br /><br />Again, this is a very nice looking stainless steel watch band. I've only had this stainless steel watch band for a short time, but I've already received numerous amounts of compliments at how stylish and great it looks. Not only is it stylish, but it will keep the watch safe and secure on your wrist It doesn't matter what I'm doing during the day, once I strap the watch on my wrist, it stays put. Many other watch bands move up and down your wrist/arm and can that can be very annoying. Not this watch band sold by Leesentec, it stays exactly where you put it on because use the double button insurance folding clasp.  Trust me, once this watch band is going no your wrist, it’s staying on your wrist.  That is a wonderful assurance!<br /><br />You’ll definitely be looking like a billion bucks with this stainless steel Apple watch band replacement sold by Leesentec. If you have an Apple Watch, do yourself a huge favor and pick up this watch band. Not only does it come in the 42mm size, but it also comes in the 38mm version.<br /><br />At this price Leesentec is selling this awesome replacement band at, it is an absolute steal and must buy!they were just not installed on the band - I hated having spend more money to buy the adapters and then installing them on the band - It was a tedious thing to install and an utter waste of my time!!!).<br /><br />Well, Leesentec eliminates the need to buy and install the adapters.

I really highly recommend this device!
This phone was suppose to be compatible with straight talks bring your own phone plan get everything I need just to call straight talk and find out its not compatible with them the only phone company that it is barely compatible with is at&t and that's it
"Cases fit phone well, no concerns with them popping off. One corner of the top portion does sit a bit high but it doesn't affect the hold onto the phone."
Case is very tough but not uncomfortable to hold. Hard to get phone out of it though. Worth the cost.
Great product.  Length is perfect for next to the bed on a night stand.
Have two of them and these have lasted me a few years now.  Great investment.
Great case!  Otter box always great.
"Can't beat the price, and they last just as long as the $20 one from Apple. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Apple fan and user. But these cables work just the same as an Apple cable, at a much lower price."
Thanks Guyes  Battery arrived safe and sound<br />Many Thanks
Works well and replace a previous 6 foot cord.
Noticed some reviews about these not fitting.. Not sure what their issues were but these went on easy and they fit just fine. The material stretches so maybe a good idea to install them in a warm environment so they give during installation :-)
"Came before the estimated time, it fits great on my phone 📞"
Works with my samsung galaxy s5 and I love the fact that it takes the place of those bulky emergency window breaking hammers!
Part number on box was right. But the mirror in box was not the right one. Did not have Comp/Temp.
"They match my wrist bands.  The most important thing is they keep my Vivo from falling off, especially when I'm carrying shopping bags.  No more lost Vivo!"
"Pretty decent, not the best headphones I've ever had but Bluetooth! Does have its occasional static and for me battery only lasts for a couple of days. I use it for working out which is between 1 to 2 hours a day."
"Worked well in retrospect to playing music from my phone over bluetooth. Fell short on being a substitute for a hands free device, road noise made it so I had to talk very loudly for people to hear me."
"I love this case, it is bright and looks really good."
This case fits my cell phone very nicely and looks great.  The company provides excellent customer service and stands behind their products.  The first case I received in the mail was defective and they sent me a new one free of charge that met my expectations.
Your phone slips out of this case it's not protective or sturdy at all do not recommend this I'm throwing it away
"This is a great phone, though many of my friends and family tease me about its large size. Using the phone function can be unwieldily due to the size. However, it performs like a dream in all functionality. Love it!"
Didn't protect my phone from cracking. Needs to wrap around the front better. If you want your phone to be protected from a very short fall do not buy this case.
Works great. Holds a ridiculous amount of charge. Thin. Rubberized exterior feels very expensive. Indicator bars are very very nice. Nice touch in adding the velvet pouch.
"Very good charger, but heavy."
I bought it for my husband for his birthday and he loves it! It's been 2 weeks so far and everything is good. Will keep updating!
Worked great for about a day. Stopped working after my cat chewed through cord. Please make future models impervious to malicious cats.
Pretty decent. The only reason I gave it three stars is because my phone is in an OtterBox and it doesn't fit. I don't like having to take my phone out of the OtterBox to put it in here to use this.
Iam very happy with this battery. Before I received it I though I had to purchase a new phone because my battery life wouldn't last 3 hours after being charged at 100%. Now my phone is working Iike new.
"it just came in the mail today and I love Ito love the color and though it seems like it could break easily, it is super cute and I'm not worried bc I have that glass screen protector. it fits perfect and way better than most of the other cheap cases that I buy. this one actually wraps around my phone"
"i expected the sparkles to be like gems, when in actuality they are just stars printed on the case. a bit disappointing, but a super cool case nonetheless"
Only for &#34;G Pro LITE&#34;  doesn't work with the regular G Pro because the case covers the flash.  My mistake   ... just cut out a hole for my flash and the case can work.
"I ordered mine straight from Proteus Labs since were not in stock yet with Amazon.  I have a Note 4, Gear VR and Colorcross headset that I also use.<br /><br />1.  The field of view is as good as the Gear VR<br />2.  Lenses are very good<br />3.  No display cut off for devices up to 5.7&#34;  (Homido cuts off at 5&#34;)<br />4.  Very comfortable<br />5.  It also barely fits my Note 4 with 8000mah extended battery if I leave the case and cover off.<br />6.  There is no focus adjustment but the image is crystal clear.<br />7.  There is no magnet<br />8.  Comes with a mini bluetooth controller<br /><br />This is IMO the next best thing to the Gear VR."
"I bought the case for my girlfriend. It was great when it came in but within a week, the case cracked already. Can I get a new one soon?"
"Excellent price for this combo - only pay about half of what you would pay if you were buying each charger separately. Both chargers work great with my Nexus 6, and the wall charger doesn't seem to get as hot as the stock Motorola charger. Nice addition with the 6 foot USB cables - about twice as long as standard USB cables."
"Only works if you can mount it directly in the middle of the handlebars, which my bike (and most) don't allow because of instrumentation.  It has no swivel mount so it sits sideways to my view.  It's pretty useless for me.  It fits my phone well though."
This amp is not new. Amp not wrapped in plastic. Missing speaker output leads. I believe this is a used amp. Very disappointed.
"I have been using Mophie Juice pack for my iphone 5s for 1.5 years now and its sturdy, and works like a rock. This one I got couple of months back for my wife's 6+. While this worked fine for these two months, the micro USB slot for charging all got pressed inside (now I recall some other reviews mentioning this), essentially rendering the pack useless.Should have saved my money and bought mophie juice pack to begin with"
Product came fast and as described. Great product
"Easy to &#34;wear.&#34;  I can fit a car and door key, cell phone, driver's license and credit card--the essentials for everyday life."
Opened the package the the item was already falling apart. I really loved the way it looked but unfortunately this became a bad buy for me
"Not many reviews for this case not sure why, but this case is amazing. At it's price point it can't be beat. It's a few bucks more than those generic cases and it feels like it has otterbox protection. Although it is a little bit bigger than what I expected, its not otterbox big. It's still has its slim profile.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Feels very secure in your hands, not slippery. The back material maybe slippery but the sides grip well.<br />-Corner bumpers seem like they would do their job, its protruded from the main case it self so it would absorb impact first.<br />-Screen lip is nice, landing face down only a boulder would be able to hit it really.<br />-The inside has a nice grippy material ensuring securty and protection.<br />-Camera opening  is closed of well so no dust will gather there.<br />-Openings for everyting are perfect except...<br /><br />Con:<br />-The only con, the audio jack opening only accomadates slim plugs, so get an adapter or use the one it came with.<br />-They should try to make a case with a clear back!"
"Great product.  Works great with my Moto X 2014.  No problems with my 2011 Audi A4 in the cigarette lighter. Originally gave this product a 5 star rating. Had to take a star away because the cord sent with it is built bad. I noticed it didn't look correct when I got it, but it still worked. Recently I have realized that the metal part that goes into the phone to charge is bent and the clips that hold it in aren't sticking out. This causes the connection to come apart frequently. I have had to disregard that cord sand use a new one."
"There is no instructions. I do not have a protector installation file in my brain. So, when I attempted to do it, I proceeded to wipe everything down, including the sticky side. I did not know it was sticky until it started get lint all over it. Of course I peeled off a protective cover first, not knowing that it was covered with sticky glue."
"I helped my wife set up some mp3 files, and then gave her this as a gift. She says everytime she turns the car off, the memory of the transmitting station goes away.  Can that possibly be true because that is crazy.  I have a different one in my car, love music.  But that seems goofy. Would be glad to update the rating if I get better information.  There are more expensive ones out there that control folders (different genres for example) and this one does NOT do that, nor does it shuffle. But for the price, and knowing that going in, it is ok."
I had high expectations for this product. It is poorly printed and the plastic feels like it could break any second. I didn't return it because it would cost more than what I paid for.
"I am very disappointed with the lack of sound volume on this unit. If you have your radio on, even down low or have your windows down there is no way that you can hear the directions. It should have enough volume so that you have extra that you don't use and adjust the level you want. Other than that major flaw it is a very good unit."
"Great for the price, and the sound is loud, works very well, just good for me while running."
"I guess the most important thing is that it doesn't leak. And it hasn't. I've strapped it around my neck and swam with it, slid down waterfalls, and jumped off of trees into water while capturing video. Picture isn't as clear while in the case, but that's likely an obvious point. I'm satisfied with the product."
"Without a doubt it is what I expected, very easy to install and it surely enhances the phone."
"i like the style, quality, and comfort of this device. really come in handy when I have to do a stand alone shift on my job."
"Just purchased these inexpensive, excellent quality, micro USB cables mainly for use with an Anker PowerBot 5 A2124111 charger.<br />They also worked as standard USB A to Micro-B data cables.<br /><br />Wish that they also packaged them as multi-color 3-packs for the same price.<br /><br />As noted by others, they may not work on a few phones or tablets that require special cables and/or chargers supplied by the manufacturer."
Buy these all the time. Great product and service
"This was inexpensive and it works to charge my phone, which is all I was really asking for. However the color is not really what it shows in the picture; it is MUCH brighter (I got the orange one). Almost fluorescent. Also the end of the cable by the Lightning connection is fairly large, and while it works fine on my phone it might not fit through the charging port on some protective cases."
"Good, sturdy little case. Plus, it has the Tardis on it so Yay!"
"Fast service. Plastic cases are good and waterproof. For what you pay for, great product"
Just ordered my 2nd one on June 2nd and it's already broke. The first one only lasted several months as well and just quit working. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!  Or if you want to and waist your money you will find out that it's not going to last very long. Disappointed.
"My iPhone is counting on it now, really protective with the slip surface, good products are hard to buy, this one is good"
"The back fit better than the original one, the back from this company fit nice an tight perfect doesnt fall off"
Nice and compact. Comes with a nice bag for easy storage. My only issue is it doesn't come with a cable that I can use with my iphone 6.
"How nice to get an entire pack of colorful cables.  What I like most about these cables is:<br /><br />1. They are short - perfect for charging devices without having excess cord all over the place<br />2. Of all the cables that I have (some quite expensive) - these seem to insert into the device ports more easily than my other cables.  Some of my tablets and kindles have ports that are starting to get mangled from so much use - but these slide right in.  This is a pleasant surprise that I did not expect from such &#34;cute&#34; cables.<br />3.  Seem to work fine with high speed chargers - no duds so far<br />4.  Although I didn't &#34;need&#34; the variety of colors, I have to admit that they are kind of fun to look at. .<br /><br />No complaints, good for the price"
"It's my 5th HTC smartphone, and I gotta say... It keeps surprising me. Great phone, better than expected!"
"This was a great purchase.  If you're looking for something like this, you won't be disappointed.  Great for the gym and phone calls (I usually only wear in one eard for phone calls and let other side hang on my shoulder)."
This thing is great.  I like that both ports are full power!  Most of these darn things have one a full power and the other is 1/2 power.
My daughter LOVES the case! It is great quality and is the first case she doesn't have to take off to charge or listen to her headphones.
I think these guys make fun holsters n stuff. Super cool man up your phone case equipment. I don't want a picture of bieber or shakira on my case so this works awesome
Great at first but started to rip after 20 uses. Don't put anything else in case otherwise water could leak in bc seal is not lined up
Awesome case!  Fits TWO cards like stated and opens as easy as I would want something that has my ID and Credit card in.
Ok so it is waterproof which is why I liked it but there's a space between the plastic cover and thae phone screen itself. Which would make it a four if the sound was better. Meaning that when I listen to my videos on YouTube the sound quality is not great so try to add a hatch that can be clicked on or off like for the charge port hatch and. Other than that it's great. Just think about the plastic screen and phone screen aor bubble because you need to press down a little bit so that you can actually touch the screen. Meaning you have to take your time when typing. 3/5 would probably look for other cases before getting this one plus the plastic just rips of so if your charger can't fit through the case and you have to take it off constantly the case start to rip off making it more prone to water and also the jack for the headphones broke off. I WOULD NOT recommend this case if you need it now then jus tf buy it but there are better cases out there
"Good cables, the 5 pack is a great value and the lengths provided is a spot on guess as to what lengths I usually need."
Cheap plastic case and very long shipping time (actually from China).  Terrible seller and terrible product.
"This case is great.  I use it to keep my phone dry while stand up paddle boarding.  I can keep my phone iphone in the case and take great pictures while out on the water.  I bought 2 more to give to friends who also paddle board, and they love theirs too."
"Randomly mutes and the control cover came off within a week.  I work at an office desk, not a lot of wear and tear.  Great transaction, fast shipping, just a mediocre product from the manufacturer."
The only thing I like is that it have a stand but I don't like it. It is not stright it is slant on one side so the pictures come out slant on one side
"This is the third battery that I have bought from Anker; however, it is not because there is a defect. I just love Anker long lasting batteries. When smartphone companies sell their phones they don't have their customers in mind. Their batteries are meant to satisfy, but Anker batteries are meant to Impress. I buy batteries from Anker because I know I'm getting QUALITY not just any company can replicate Ankers amazing service."
Great price.  Exactly how it was advertised.
"I like the case design, but the edges of the rubber and hard case do not align. There's a big gap, like you'd expect out of Chinese products."
"This is not a hard case, but fits on easily and so far has protected the phone."
My wife has expended a lot of time looking for a car charger for her cell phone that wasn't expensive.Finally she found it in Amazon and New Power gear.Thanks.
Pretty case & does it's job of holding the phone in place away from environmental messes. I received item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
The only problem I have is that the connection to the phone is not snug enough and it falls out most of the time.
Love this product! Keeps my hands free while I'm walking multiple dogs which is why I got it.
"Amazing case! I like that it's slim and crystal clear so you don't look the aesthetic of the iPhone 6 (I got the gold because the color is gorgeous). It's also very protective all around. I'm a bit of a klutz, and while this phone is less than a month old, I've dropped it many times. The case really does save the phone from damage. I originally bought the Spigen brand case--which I prefered the look of because it's 100% clear on both sides--but it was ill-fitting and somewhat loose when on the phone. I got this recommended by my sibling and it's so much better--and at a cheaper price than most cases you find on Amazon. I can even use my lens accessories with this case still on the phone. I greatly recommend it to any iPhone owner who wants to protect their phone and also keep the sleek look of the iPhone.<br /><br />Update: I've used this case for over a year exclusively and I would like to add on to my previous review. I still love that it's thin enough to not interfere with my use of the phone, but it still feels sturdy and capable of protecting the phone. An issue I realized over time is the discoloration of the bumpers (not a functional issue, just aesthetic). Another issue I have noticed is that dust and lint find their way into the case somehow. This unfortunately leads to scratches on the actual phone. I do have a couple of spots with damage due to dust/lint. So far those are my only complaints, even if they really aren't a big deal. Everything about the case is still in working order and it still protects my phone very well.<br /><br />I am planning on re-purchasing this case soon because it truly fits my needs better than any case I've seen thus far, despite the minor issue with dust/lint. I would still recommend it to iPhone owners who love how their phones look and feel, but still want to have it protected from life as it goes 🙂"
"Literally the best case ever. My girlfriend, when attacked by a spider on my balcony, some twenty feet above the ground, threw her Incipio encased iPhone the whole way down. When retrieved, the phone was in better condition than before."
Good water proof speaker it works well however it only comes with a USB charger and no wall charger so u have to buy one but it's really not a problem though
"Great style, feel, and fit. Couldn't be better except if it had a cutout for the sim and SD cards, so I don't have to take off the case to access them. ."
"Not a good product!  The instruction manal was very vague and I could not find a way to contact anyone for help. You can not mount the camera because the power cord sticks straight out the back and it is short requiring an extension cord. The app has to be running on your cell phone constantly to get information from the camera / doorbell and it sucks up your battery life. The color is not good, green trees look red!  Maybe that was a  warning sign?"
"Works well.  Compact.  Slightly difficult to see blue LED, but this is not a reason to not buy it."
"This speaker has amazing sound. The Bluetooth connects easily to all my devices, with a range of at least 30 feet in my house. I haven't tested how long the battery lasts before recharging."
"It says &#34;certified&#34; to not get messages, I got messages on different phones, with different cords, with different adapters. Do NOT pick."
"Bought this cable because Cheaper cables frayed, so Ibwas looking for something sturdy I could throw in my backpack. This cable gets top marks on every requirement for a cable:<br /><br />1. Sturdy build, parts don't fall off (it's happened), cables don't fray or pull out<br />2. Charges phone without getting an &#34;unauthorized equipment&#34; message<br />3. Design is understated but stylish, and the braiding around the cord is actually soft, which is unexpected and cool.<br /><br />A definite thumbs-up recommendation for this."
Love this little beastie. Part smart watch part fitness trainer.  Works simply and accurately. Setup is pretty easy. I had one problem (my fault) that customer service answered almost immediately.
"Sleek, perfect, professional and nice feel!"
"This is truly a waterproof case. I've tested it went I got it, I went swimming with it, took it in the shower and no water has gotten in!<br />At first I was little iffy because it seems like it wasn't going to protected it because it's a thin case but boy was I wrong! I actually really like the thiness now. All the other waterproof cases that I have a big and bulky and just annoying to have on my phone. But this one is so light weight and overall a fantastic water proof case."
Instructions were totally wrong. The manufacturer must have updated their website (in French) and the page they told me in their instructions was completely different. Could not activate the card at all - complete waste of money
Cute case gets the job done. I am taking a star off because the case is actually pretty tricky to get on. The blue piece is solid and has to try and bend around the black silicone piece which hits all your buttons.
I have literally had them for a month and the &#34;adaptive fast charging&#34; stopped working? It doesn't seem like samsung.
Case is good but none of my charging cords fit. Access is poor & a pain. I would not buy lifeproof again
"I love this product, this is my second time ordering. Sadly, have not yet received this order an entire month after ordering :("
Case fits perfectly and looks good for a very reasonable price.  Not too bulky.  Very easy to install.  Utilized an iCarez screen protector as that seemed more substantial than the one included.  Will buy another if this one wears out.
Delivered on time. This fits great for my iPhone and I would recommend this to anyone out there
The only problem is Arizona heat on the phone. I use a less insulated case when temps are above 105.
"Magpul makes the best cellphone case. 4 kids (3 boys), 2 in the army and they take a beating and work great."
I love my Sahara iPhone 6 case!! It's perfect! Exactly what I wanted!
No this is my second one - the plastic is too flimsy and cheap. The phone case is too slippery and make it drop out of your hands easily. It cracked 2 weeks after I got it. I ended up buying a $5 dollar phone case at Walmart.
It doesn't even cancel the noise or reduce it at all. When I'm on the phone and it's just a little noisy the person on the other end can't hear me at all
"Purchased this bag for my Sony dsc-400 and it fits perfectly.  I got it for travel so the camera is protected in my carry on bag and everything I want to take on trips fits in the bag also.  There is room for my extra filter, cord, extra batteries plus the extra charger I bought.  There is room above where the camera fits to stash a cleaning cloth too.  Very happy with this bag and the blue color is pretty too!"
"I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I am actually quite happy with the screen protectors, they get the job done and keep my screen safe. I really like that they cover a lot of the screen, much more than what my last protector covered. But, it was a bit hard to get it spot on since you didn't have much wiggle room; however, I managed to get it on there perfectly with only a few air bubbles. I also really like that the screen protectors are scratch resistant, but I felt like they make the actual screen very slightly blurry, still nothing to be that concerned about since the screen quality still looks great with the protector on. definitely happy and will purchase again in the future."
"Cracked the screen on the very first drop. Great that it holds money, but it offers zero protection to the phone."
Not easy to put earbuds in correctly
"I love this little gadget, it works as expected. I have an Galaxy s5 and it fits perfectly without my cell phone case. My case is pretty bulky it's a clear Chanel phone case so it's understandable. Would buy again."
This is the second charger I purchased from this seller. Great product.Super fast shipping. Thank you!
The screen protector didn't fit properly. The more flexable part of the case doesn't perfectly fit with the hard shell.
"The battery life it self is amazing, I am a heavy game user. Usually at the end of the day it is still at 50-60% after heavy use. My only issue is the battery for my s5 does not fit in very well and would come loose and lose connection. So I had to add small pads to the battery so it wouldn't come loose. Other then that I love these batteries."
"When it arrived a lot of the jewels were missing and more fell off when I grabbed it, I couldn't even use it it's very cheaply made"
great value for the money
"This product does NOT fit for the Glaxy S3, nor does it fit in the typical wall port in most homes, do NOT buy."
Arrived early! So stinking cute! Love love love it! Makes going from a smart phone to a flip phone completely worth it! Would buy again!
"This unit is nice. I'm using it with Google Cardboard applications and an iPhone. All this is early in the development, so it's not surprising that everything isn't perfectly synched. The headset is doing it's part."
This case fit perfectly and offers a decent level of protection with a minimal  impact to the thickness of the device. The device is so thin that this cover actually made it easier to handle. The material is very durable and doesn't tear or breakdown like some materials I've seen. The cover is translucent so the color of your device will impact the color of the case.
"Product seems nice. No fingerprints or otherwise, but almost impossible to align. Always offcenter, then doesn't stick all the way after it says you can pull it off and re-seat it."
"At first, I is working fine, but it is dead at random time with the message like this accessory is not supported."
Horrible do not buy. I received this last week and now it's stop synching and will not turn on. Piece of crap. Buy a fitbit
Ideal product for me with my iPhone 6. It allows me to attach my headphones and the cover magnets ensure good closure.
I received my charger and was excited to try it but I think I got a lemon.  I have charged it twice thru the USB port on my computer and it does not seem to hold its charge.  After charging the first time it I tried to charge a GoPro battery with it and the battery looked like it was charging but after over night the GoPro battery was not charged when I tried it in my GoPro.  Not sure if I am doing something wrong.  Sending it back to get a replacement.  Hopefully I can give it a 5 star when I get the replacement.
"Love this case. I wanted something I could still see the gold color of of my iPhone 6 through, and it works great - can still see the phone, yet it's protected. I have dropped my phone twice since using this case, plus a glass-like screen protector and both together have kept my phone safe and sound. Love the peach pop of color on the bottom back also."
This is a great case and the reason why...becasue i dropped my phone 3 times and it kept it safe.  A little bulky but I am ok with it.
Overall I like it.  Only problem is I have to keep making sure the back is all the way on.  Slides out sometimes.
Works better and battery life last longer than the original HTC battery when it was new and still is working very well. I am planning on buying two more for two other people who have this phone and the battery charger
Too heavy and too small in circumference for average woman
Fits great and looks like will last as long as my original (3 years).
"Directions were hard to read but had the directions to the lost phone just like it but from Mexico; so this one we really like, also."
"I bought 2 of these cords, 1 as a replacement for the 1st, for my ipad. I'm not buying this brand again."
"Got this for the 11 year old son of a friend, he loves it, very attractive phone and works well."
Great product. Easy to operate and fits my ears and head perfectly.  I also wear eye glasses while jogging.  No issues
Sorry it was just the wrong one for our phone but it was nice
This is the best and most economical Phone Cover that I have ever purchased. Totally protects my 6+ and it's so convenient for carrying everything!
"Let me just say this sub is absolutely amazing for the price, I have one 10 hooked up to a 3000 watt amp and oh my god can it handle every last bit. After one week of tuning and breaking it in, I turned it up half way and blew the back window out of my BMW. Will never buy anything but Soundqubed!!"
"I honestly wasn't expecting much for $10.  This unit surprised and impressed me.  Just as a test, I recharged a Kindle, 10&#34; tablet and my smart phone after intentionally running the batteries almost all the way down.  The portable battery recharged all three fully on just one charge,  A $10 item that can do all this - brave.  I am ordering more for stocking stuffers."
Returned product.  Did not meeting my expectations for performance quality.
Got my active 6 case in a couple days after paying extra for shipping.  The inner case fit good. But the outer case with the clip does go with the phone. It fits too snug and very difficult to get on. I just don't use it. The protective screen cover fits perfect. Over all it was a good but.
Great sound for a great price! I've been very happy with this product!
"Excellent product, well made ​​, excellent quality and efficient delivery ."
"Kickstand works Great, I use it often. Protects phone back and edges and actually makes it easier to hold. Have purchased the same case for all the phones like this in our family. Does NOT have the protection of the Otter Box or Life Proof, if you need that kind of protection, invest in one. This is well worth the money for basic everyday protection."
"Mine will not keep the date correct  tor more than a few days at most. The suction cup simply fell apart.  Nice concept, quality control sucks, typical of many Chinese products!  They have the talent. Why so dam cheap on QC!"
"My husband used the same Sena brand for his previous Iphone 5 and really liked the quality of the leather. This one I purchased for his current Iphone 6 fits perfect and he likes it.  It's slim yet very durable. The quality of the leather is really good and the details of the stitching is sewn in really well. He has dropped it several times in the parking lot, and the upper right corner of his phone just got scratched. I think it is over priced, but my husband thinks it's worth it.  I feel that cases should not cost almost as much as cell phones. However, if you don't have the time to shop around for dozens of cases and want to get a really durable quality and attractive leather case, this one is a MUST BUY if you do not mind the price tag."
Great product for the price
"For affordability, it's decent. Where my issue is, are the ear buds would not seat within my ear correctly. As I have them on while running, the sweat would make them slide off the back of my head. In the end I'm running with them in my hand. So I believe if the head set was adjustable around the ear, it would be a better product for me. I guess my head size is a little big. Overall I would give it two stars."
"Sound quality is OK, but I always have to unpair and pair quite frequently in order to get audio feed."
"I absolutely LOVE THESE!!!!!! They fit very securely in my ear, and not very heavy at all. I love that I can have my phone in my pocket or on the table instead tied to me via a headset cord. They have amazing sound, and if you do use them for a phone call the person on the other end of the line hears you very clear too. I was surprised at how great the sound quality on a phone call was. You don't sound like you're in a deep hole either; in fact, I was told they could hear me better when I was using the headphones vs just calling with my phone. They are now the go to headset in our house and I have no doubts we will be buying more in the future. *I received this product for free/at discount in exchange of my honest opinion/review."
Arrived fast! The case is very nice and detailed. A gift for my little brother that he very much appreciated and loved! Thank you!
I thought that it was a cell phone cover to cover the entire cell phone. I was surprised when I received it. It was not what I wanted.
"Makes taking pictures of ourselves much easier, and folds nicely for travel."
Can't use my aux cord because it's too thick. Can't use fingerprint for security password. But it will protect my phone. Cute backing.
"Not even 2 days after I got it, the black rubber outter later came right off. I should have listened to the comments and bought a different one"
Great cables - works perfectly with Anker power block.
Held a charge for a few weeks but is as bad as the old battery
"Very cable, long enough better that the generic apple cable"
"I was very skeptical when I received the Mazichands Wired Selfie Stick but it is much better than expected.  At first glance upon receiving it, I thought no way would this hold my phone and last, but it has been working much better than I expected.  I have a Note 3 with an Otter Box so it is quite heavy and the Mazichands Wired Selfie Stick while fully extended held my phone with no problems.  The pole is adjustable.  Another big bonus was that this selfie stick has a threaded tripod screw and you can attach it directly to your tripod and extend the distance in which you are taking your photos.  My phone has excellent resolution and it takes great photos, but it was a little wobbly at this length as some of the photos were blurry.  I think if I took off the Otter Box it would be okay but then my phone is not protected.  At this length or if you need the distance it would work perfectly with a lighter phone or even a GoPro.<br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised with the Mazichands Wired Selfie Stick and the only thing it didn’t come with was the Blue Tooth capabilities.  This is a wired selfie stick and the bonus there is that you don’t have to charge it. I received an email immediately after purchasing from the seller with instructions that can be downloaded and a YouTube video.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased and honest review and testing. All opinions stated are 100% my own and have not been swayed."
"pretty good, the backs not aluminium but its rather sturdy, not just a sticker- I threw it in my bag ewith my keys and while it was slightly damaged, it was a dent-like scratch, not a tear."
"Nice phone case. Not bulky and easy to slide in & out of pocket. The only thing I don't like is that it isn't very easy to feel side button covers, especially the power button. I have to look at it to push it."
"Great charger, best wireless charger I have used so far- I used it for a verizon sony xperia z3v phone"
"Exactly as described! If you are looking for a good portable charger, this is definitely the one to get! Once fully charged, it will charge your phone completely up to 3 or 4 times. I have gone through many portable chargers and charging phone cases but this is by far the best one i have ever gotten. It definitely is up to expectations and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good and reliable portable charger!"
"The UP24 is a good product but there are some drawbacks that you must be aware of.<br />The UP24 is supposed to be worn 24/7, but the UP24 can irritate our skin, if when you sweat, ant then sticks to your skin and mine caused my skin to get sore.<br />entUP24 does has a sleep function that monitors your sleep pattern. One word of warning.<br />It detects light sleep are the belief is that if you are sleeping light you move around more, but if you share a bed, this is not always the case.<br />It detects deep sleep by non movement.<br />As soon as you activate sleep mode, it will start to monitor you moving. If you are awake and still, it will register you in deep sleep, if you are awake and move about, it will register that you are sleeping light. When you are actually asleep, if the deep and light sleep movements are correct then it is accurate. The steps it registers will not be correct, however this is the same for all wrist step monitors. These do not accurately register your steps as it does not detect some, due to how you are walking and if you are using your hands for anything else; taking on your mobile, drinking, eating, etc.,. It connects to your phone by Bluetooth, but this type of connection, does drain the battery quicker and your phone synchronises with your phone every minute. Apart from all the downsides it is a got device, make sure you also obtain the latest software update from the web as this increases the UP24 battery life from 7 days to 14 days, the updates also fix some of the issues Jawbone (manufacturer) detect."
"Works great,  very pleased worth service and battery.  No problems"
"Had been looking for a long cord to charge my 2nd generation iPad, as the 3 foot cords are problematic if you need to charge and use your  iPad simultaneously.  With this 10 foot cord I can relax on the couch and use my iPod without it pulling from the charger.  Cord has worked very well thus far.  Now I have to purchase a 2nd cord for at work so there is short cord there was well"
This cover did not fit my droid phone I did not have s good experience since I been replying often& nothing is getting done about it once lppp
"I purchased the clear cases from Spigen and Maxboost to compare with one I like the best. Maxboost won! It fits so well. A little harder to remove from the phone than the Spigen's case. That means it's really sturdy and tight! It's doesn't absorb any color from your jeans. I have this case for 5 month. No scratch on the back and inside. Every once a while, I would wash it with soap. It looks like brand new again! The photo shows the current condition of the case. It still looks shining after 5 months of use."
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter. I got the product as ordered, but the back was completely separated from the frame. I had to super glue them back together. I'm disappointed that this case is so poorly made."
Bought two TYLT VU3's for work and home charging for my Nexus 6.  Works Amazingly!  Only down side I've noticed is that my Nexus 6 gets really warm after sitting on the charger for long periods.
"If after reading the other reviews you still decide to buy one of these, then let me one again tell you what you are actually getting. This is a really high tech Bluetooth ear piece with so so audio. I haven't returned mines because it does serve one really good function; it allows me to see my emails and texts without pulling out my phone, is that worth the $150.00 to you? To me it is. I can tell you though that Samsung has lost me as a customer because of things like this, if you really want a smart watch then wait until you upgrade to Apple. The other version of this will add to your mobile phone bill and your frustration."
"Works great. Only problem is that my vent moves with the weight of the phone. Not a big deal, and I fixed it by attaching a Lego below the vent to keep the phone flat."
"Great quality dual IPhone 6 case cover. I have the added protection from the green case, and also from the white bumper which goes on top of the case. Cutouts within case to access all buttons and ports.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Ravine 2 is a good phone. I just use it for calls and texting so it works well for me. Wish the front screen would stay on all the time like the Ravine 1 does, and the battery doesn't last quite as long as the 1 ( 5-6 days vs. 7-8). Overall I'm pleased with the purchase."
"This DOES NOT fit my 7 inch Sylvania player. The case is too way big for a 7 inch player (It is too big that a 9 inch player may fit there). I adjusted the straps very tight and I did my best for this thing to work out. However, the player fell and almost my screen got broken.<br /><br />I am returning this product asap!!!"
I do like the selfie stick but don't love how you must unscrew the bottom portion to plug into outlet. It is difficult to unscrew however I was very happy with the quality.
Fits comfortably. The only problem I would say that this phone protector has is that the kickstand doesn't  close all the way or snap to the phone. I Mean the kickstand works but it just a little annoying that It won't snap closed
"Great product. Despite the comments regarding the lack of coverage in woods, I had very good reception in throughout the national parks.The battery life is incredible."
Like it going to protect my phone from as many times as I drop it but wish I would have got one with the belt case cuz that would have protected my screen but is overall happy with all
"This screen protector went on very nicely. It was a simple process, and now I can feel more comfortable that my screen is protected."
"Glad I only paid $11 for this. That's because it went from the packaging directly into the trash can. It's a cheap plastic case with a greenish grey sticker unevenly applied to the back. They didn't even get the sticker on in the right place!!! It looks, feels, even screams cheap. Nothing remotely resembling carbon fiber. Save your money. This isn't even worth my time to return it. Garbage."
Best phone case out there. I prefer this case to any other because it provides protection without being too bulky.
Seems to work fine.  4 stars because I have not yet seen how long it will last. Could be 5 stars this time next year.
The battery still don't have no longer use than the original battery I just took out . Does this battery replace the galaxy s4 sgh1337 phone also?
"Product came in nicely packaged, material looks durable and sturdy. When I when ahead and put on case on my LG G2 I saw some concerns. The inner rubber protector is not flexible like other 2 part cases. When I put on the rubber protector I notice that it doesn't fit the phone correctly. Usually in one corner it will not go in correctly. After trying to put case correctly for more then 10minutes, I gave up and put on the outer case. Both parts match together correctly but when trying to put them over the phone like it should to protector the phone it doesn't fit correctly. Not sure if the manufacture has noticed this defect but this product was really not much use for me."
keeps turning off.  would charge for a minute then a blinking purple light would come on and my phone would stop charging.  This is a disappointment as a Samsung product...  I'm not sure if my product is a defective one but would like a replacement first to see if that's the case.  Until then... well.. I definitely don't recommend buying this product.
"It is so &#34;bling&#34; and looks great,  BUT , Be careful! I struggled and argued with by cell phone service provider over why my cell signal was low or nonexistent in major metro areas, only to learn that this case was the issue. Once I removed the case, I was back to 4G no problem. I do not recommend."
"Works perfectly; easy set up, no technical problems at all so far. Must have if you produce video content for business on a regular basis like I do."
"Had this for a while now, and now I don't go anywhere without it! These batteries last longer than the Gopro ones, and the dual charger charges them FAST.<br /><br />I plug it into my iPhone wall charger or my PCs USB and it'll be charged in 1-2hours. Lifetime warranty is a plus, especially since this gets a lot of use from me.<br /><br />A must for gopro enthusiasts."
"[[VIDEOID:723c867a014871005f710c59debfb3a6]] See the video for the real review aspect. I simply prefer magnetic mounts over all others because of the ease of use.<br /><br />The sticky gel means most mounting locations will work and the range of adjustment is plentiful.<br /><br />Best part is just laying the phone against it and being done...it allows for a little wiggle but the phone doesn't fall. I don't think there is any simpler mount to use and this one does not block the air vents...so better yet over the other magnetic mounts!<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
"Don't LOVE it as the top slot was slightly misaligned with the hole making it difficult to get a plug in.... not worth returning over, buuut pretty frustrating."
I have found this to be a clever and secure way to mount a Cell Phone to a GoPro camera mount.
Tried a similar system for half the price with zero improvement.  Installed this kit and it made a dramatic improvement in gully in rural oregon.  Nor cheap but it works.
"Very nice quality.  I looked at several wallet style cases that ended up looking a little too much like a woman's purse.  This one is more, for lack of a better team, &#34;manly&#34; (just take the straps off).  I purchased a credit card style key fob for my car that fits in this thing nicely, so I am essentially down to one item in my pocket, instead of the standard keys/wallet/phone.  I originally was going to give it 4 stars and the only reason I wasn't going to give it 5 stars is something you will see in several reviews, and that is that the binding is not wide enough, so when you have your phone in it, along with a few cash bills and even just one card in each card slot, the wallet sits open because the binding is not wide enough. However,  that is pretty easy to fix if you have strong fingers, by simply curling inward the inside edge of the hard cover on the credit card side.  You have to do it about 1cm at a time and just pinch really hard to essentially fold about 4mm of the edge inward all the way from top to bottom.  Once you have it folded inward, you can sort of twist and stretch and bend along the seem over and over again until it's soft.  It takes about 3 minutes, and now I have a wider binding and it doesn't negatively effect the look of the case at all.  If desired, once you do that, you can quite reasonably fit 2 cards in each slot."
This is a great screen protector. Installation was easy. The included dust absorber helped pull off all dust particles before applying the screen protector which basically adhered itself once it was put down. Great product for the price. It's just add good as my husband's more expensive glass screen protector.
"UPDATE.<br />Had some issues so I left a review and contacted the company and they quickly replaced the battery pack with a new one which works perfectly. Thanks for the excellent customer support!  I will continue to buy their products due to this amazing support.<br /><br />ORIGINAL.<br /><br />i have had it for about  year, but only used it s few times - mostly camping etc when i needed to recharge.  Whats disappointing is that it doesn't hold charges anymore.  i just charged it - and it took forever to charge.  Then i immediately plug in my phone and its already at 1 bar of power.  i guess you get what you pay for?"
The screen  protector is smaller than my Samsung note 4 about 1mm on each side edge.  It works
"Case is just OK due to the fact that the clear screen was extremely scratched ... almost as if it weren't new at all.  As for the fit and protection, I would rate that part 5-stars, but due to the screen I can only give 3."
"Great case! Finally a pretty case for the s5. To all case brands, people who have the s5 want stylish cases as well! Iphone owners are not the only people with a sense of style."
"The Aukey power bank has a sleek minimalist design and is very stylist. They packed a 10,000 mAh lithium-ion battery inside that will provide about four charges for most smartphones and can charge other devices like e-readers, speakers, anything that takes a USB charging connection.  It has two charging ports, one regular one that charges up to 1.0 A and one incorporating Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology at up to 2.4 amps for faster charging of compatible devices.  I also like how it uses premium Sony cells that support over 1000 uses and charges. It also has multiple built-in safeguards fully protect against over-current, overcharging and overheating ensure reliability and safety. I like to trust name brand cell much more than no name cells. I'm glad Aukey is being safe and only using high quality cells to protect customers and ensure quality.  Like most charger packs, there is a button to press to start the charging process if it doesn't automatically start. It's the same button that you hold for a couple of seconds to activate the LED flashlight, which is handy when traveling or during power emergencies or just for fun.  The power bank itself recharges overnight with a USB to micro-USB cable from any powered USB port or adapter. It took me about 6 hours with a fast 2.4A wall charger.  This battery comes with a clear instruction pamphlet, an 18-month warranty, and micro usb cable.  The only thing I wished the battery had was a charge left indicator LED so I can see how much charge is left in the battery pack. It's not a huge deal though.  Great product overall! 5 stars for quality and price."
"It protects the screen and dot view looks great. Using this on the M8 is a pain sometimes and most of the issues has everything to do with the fact that the back of the phone is curved. Since it is curved, the cover does not fold flat onto the back making holding it a bit awkward, and when putting it down on the table the phone is at an angle. The material is a bit stiff and as such the cover snaps shut when you lay it at a 180 degrees."
It is what it is.  Cheap.  Price is great but you get what you pay for.  Do yourself a favor and just buy a top name brand.
"Great product second purchase , drop several time including on concert and my screen didn't break just the tamper glass."
"Too bad, stop working after one month.  This is the first time I wrote feedback at Amazon, but I have to write it to let everyone know this product does not work. It comes with 3, one stopped working after couple days. And all of them stopped working after just one month."
I like it. It doesn't stick in the vent as well as I would. Like and does fall out on occasion.  Great concept. I like it and glad I purchased
Works and fits well will save phone if dripped from head hight..
"Looked pretty authentic when I got it, but its less than 2 months now and it stopped working. I didn't expect this to last a lifetime, but definitely expected it to last more than 6 weeks!"
"The quality of this screen protector seems to be of high quality. The only drawback is the size of the glass. There is little forgiveness when installing meaning the size of the screen protector is cut out exactly for the visible screen of my Nexus 6. On the phone there is a slight border on either side of the screen, if the glass was cut a little larger you would not need to be so exact when installing, and as anyone knows who has ever installed a glass screen protector, precision is a very difficult thing."
Cool case.<br /><br />Shows off the beauty of my iPhone and has a pop of color to add my own style (lime green).<br /><br />It gets dirty around the edges from my makeup and it's hard/near impossible to clean the dirt out that gets stuck in the sides.<br /><br />But I blame myself for that.<br /><br />It's an awesome case.
Broke after 1 week. Terrible reception!
"This case allows the phone to slide out of the bottom.  We bought it for my husband who works construction.  As he was getting into a machine the phone fell out.  He didn't realize it until he had run over the phone several times.  I feel like the purpose of the case was to protect the phone, which it obviously didn't do."
"An overall decent phone. Keeping expectations in check, this phone suffices. Moto E forces you to consider its good quality and current low cost.  Cons: Poor camera quality and lack of LED flash; front-facing lens.   Screen resolution is adequate but lacking compared to higher-end phones, if you've experienced one, of course.   3G-only but does use T-Mobile HSPA+ (H) and provides good-enough speeds.  Pros: Attractive design and build quality is better than expected for a now-sub-$100 phone   Screen quality is good but may seem lacking as competition in this price-range catches up. Decent resolution and brightness, colors are good but a little too warm.   Battery life! Although not as good as the first generation Moto G in my experience. Still excellent.   Running on Android 5.1 Lollipop."
"Does the job, great for travel when you need to charge more than one device."
"The first one I got would not work with the AT&T SIM at the AT&T store. They said it was a CDMA model. Took it to the Apple Store to get it unlocked. The Genius looked at the MEID & pointed out it starts with 99, which means it will only work with international GSM, not U.S. A U.S. GSM version would have an MEID starting with 013. I returned it for an exchange & the replacement also started with 99. Even had Verizon listed as the carrier on a sticker.<br />Don't buy unless you're on Verizon or another CDMA network."
"The bass control nobb was broken, it just spins and spins. Also the plate that says soundstream is super lose (also on the bass nobb)"
"This phone is TERRIBLE do not buy it. Camera is terrible can't take a picture thats not completely blurry. I had the phone for only a month before the charger stopped working. 2 months in now and the phone is worthless. It turns itself off from the small vibration, even being in my pocket for about 30 seconds.I brought it in to T mobile and they told me I would get a replacement shipped overnight under warranty. A week later i receive the replacement and it comes without a battery or back cover. Well it turns out the issue was in the back cover (the power button is on the back with some circuitry). So my replacement phone is having the same exact issue as the old one. not a happy camper right now."
"I bought this for my uncle. Nice case, sturdy yet flexible enough. Good feel, his cell phone looks better!"
"Tech Armor has many many great products and many different screen protectors. I always go for the HD clear ballistic glass screen protector. This screen protector protects the screen of your phone, it protects the screen from cracking when you drop it. Ever since i have been buying these protectors, my screen has never broken. Sometimes you drop your phone, flip it over and its cracked, i know worst feeling ever, but even if the screen appears to be cracked when you drop it, it is probably just the glass screen protector. It is much easier to replace a $10-$15 screen protector rather than a $100 or more screen itself. I would highly recommend this to every single person who has an IPhone!!"
If you have a larger phone like my Droid Maxx it is a really tight fit with the case on.  Product works great just needs to be a little bigger.
"I guess I misread the description? Only one of the two cables can transmit data. The other will only charge. If you are simply looking to charge two devices at a time it's a great product. If you were looking to use it to feed data/images to two devices at once, this wont do it."
Holds iPhone 6 with mophie case no problem. Put this on the dash of my car and have driven a couple thousand miles without any issues. Awesome that the Metal sticker that goes on your phone is NOT a magnet. adds almost no bulk to the phone. Only wish was that it was just black and didn't have the swirl graphic.
Works great so far. Great quality cord. Love braided cords like this because they tend to last longer and can take a beating. Would recommend.
"Connects really fast. Battery backup is just awesome. Sound quality average, but that you can expect at this price.<br />Looks good and perfect gym companion. Recommended!"
"This phone is a piece of s***. Worth maybe 5 or 10 dollars, defiantly not 60. The camera sucks, won't connect to a wifi network and has a s***ty 4g network. Phone calls are constantly being dropped. I have AT&T and never had this kind of problem before I had this phone."
Not 9H. Unless my keys are made out of diamond. Definitely the least impact resistant screen protector I've had. Not even worth $5.
"I got what I paid for (about $13) I can't imagine anyone every paying over $90 for these like amazon suggests. They fit on my ears and connect to my phone easily. The battery seems to hold up pretty well. I work in a loud environment so I turn the volume up full blast, seems to be okay. Not any kind of noise canceling quality though, but they aren't advertised as such. I'm also bummed that sometimes if I play a video on my phone the audio won't come through the headphones. But it works with my music apps. I have not attempted to make any calls or use the phone feature."
I bought it go my trip to mexico.  Worked the first 2 days perfectly fine. But then water somehow got right in it on the third day. And once you where underwater would let my phone take pictures only videos which i think its the type of plastic they use. Also you can only use your front face camera. But for 7$ can't expect to much.
"This is a solid unit. I went through two blue tooth headsets, but both were iffy. Poor audio mainly and didn't work for screenshot videos at all  - which is the primary reason I went back to the goodl old USB method. Recommnded."
"I purchased this particular product expecting to get both the Tempered Glass (Front) and PET (Back) Screen Protector for my device, but after opening the product package I found that the PET (Back) Screen Protector was missing."
Best Lightning cable going. Much more durable construction than the flimsy ones Apple provides. Comes with an 18 month warranty like all their products.
I bought this and it works great if you are playing music from your phone but not for calls.<br />I synced this with Iphone 6 and for incoming and outgoing calls I had to increase the volume to max to be able to hear the caller. Even tho music I can hear properly. I even increased the volume on my iphone but still very hard to hear the person. I don't know if I have defective unit or something else but not happy because that was the main purpose I bought this for.
"Unfortunately, it only charged my Galaxy S5 fully twice. On subsequent attempts, it did not charge it to 100%.  It stopped charging at 89% and 90%.  It was the only thing being charged at the time.<br />This was after draining the battery on the Anker and fully charging it.<br />It would only charge my Samsung S 8.4 Tablet to 100% once as well. It also was the only thing being charged.<br /><br />I have returned this and ordered the Anker 20100 hoping that it will work better. I like the fact that it will charge 2 devices at 2 Amps should I attempt to do two devices at once.<br /> I know 2 other people who had the 16000 and had no issues. I am going to be positive that mine was defective."
This case is a year old & still holding up beautifully.
The case is nice overall but the latch that closes the back cover broke off after a few days.
"I bought it for my 70 years old mom, it came with the pen.  She loves it, the pen helps alot."
"At the beginning I liked this product as it held firm on my windshield, as the glue was helping. I used it to hold my iphone 6plus.<br />However when summer came, the rubber did not survive the sun hitting on the windshield. The rubber melted and now my windshield has this messy mix of glue and melted rubber.<br /><br />Obviously the product had never been tested for typical summer conditions."
Cute case!!!! Fits like a glove
"will not fit on round vents, such as those on a 2007 Ford F150.  Seems to be a great product, but just not for that truck if you are looking for vent mount solutions."
"Great quality. But read carefully, if case is used - needs to be open bottom. If not, case needs to be removed. Quality craftsmanship -- heavy and sturdy!"
Works well for listening to music on my phone during my daily walks.  Not so easy to answer phone calls or texts while wearing it.
Easy to put on... Great quality my sister really liked that it doesn't look huge on the phone<br />The black looks really good
"Excellent, have had it for several months in fact and dropped at least ten times. Nearly half the price of other retailers."
"It is my first smart phone and I love it so far. My only problem was I could not get Tracfone to give me an area code to match my home address. They will only let you enter a zip code and gave out an area code that was in a different section of the twin cities that I didn't recognize. I was told that the area codes are chosen at random based on the zip. I tried changing my phone number 3 times. I ended up transferring my old phone number from a different provider to get the correct area code, otherwise people in my area wouldn't recognize it as a local number and may not pick up."
Cute.  Wanted a cover that would allow me to put the phone on a stand
"cute little case. phone stays in really securely, no worries about it falling out. card slots are totally separated, so each card has an individual slot. i do wish it had a little more protection for the phone, it would have made the case bulkier, but i don't mind that. it is actually a very slick slim phone case, fits easily in a pocket.  i received a discount on the product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
"If the web sight, or the packaging, had directions for using the wireless setup , I would have given it a 5 star"
"It came in much faster than expected, which was perfect since I was leaving for California that night. It's 100% waterproof, but after a few days, the blue plastic began to crack. It's great if you want to take pictures temporarily under water, like I did, but not if you're going to keep it as a protection case."
"Not a micro Usb cable, it's a micro sd cable. Would not fit my PS3 controller or do anything I bought the cable to do"
"Hello, I am writing to inform you that the damaged cell wine is not heard with headphones and the phone resets all the time. Please answer soon I hope."
"I purchased this case at the GATS from this company or a TPR (honestly couldn't tell) but I can co firm it is the same case.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) The resaler sold it to me for $120 and I purchased it forgetting to check else ware (partially my fault there) but the principle still stands. Is the case with $120 or $99? No. Go and buy another one. If you are paying $20 ok decent but still not worth it.<br /><br />2) I was supposed to receive a receipt of my purchase which I have not which just makes me mad, so I can't take advantage over anything like warranty if I ever needed to.<br /><br />3) The kickstand after gently opening as possible as I could it broke.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />None"
I like it.  It shows the back of the phone of this phone - sexy.
"I wanted to use primary for hands free answering phone, I could hear well but the other party cannot hear at all.  The mic is not walking."
"This band looks and feels decent. I am still partial to my stock stainless steel and black sport bands. However, I wear this on occasion just to give it a different look. Worth the money if you don't have a stainless steel band."
"Not to comfortable to hit the volume buttons along with the lock button. good material, holds enough of a charge to keep my iPhone going for 3-4 days, but all around a nice case for a reasonable price."
"Didn't last, the plastic seemed cheap... And it broke after a few weeks."
"For $180, this phone has blown me away. I considered spending a lot more money for the Moto X 2014, Alcatel Idol 3, Zenfone 2, etc.<br /><br />I'm completely thrilled with the build quality, snappiness, and overall performance of the phone.  Stock android is also definitely the way to go.  I was worried about 1GB of RAM not being sufficient, but with the light use I put this phone through on a daily basis, it isn't an issue. It's worth mentioning that the iPhone 6 only has 1GB.<br /><br />Only Con is the 8 GB of internal storage.  I will be buying an SD for this phone."
"The case itself is nice and feels well made.  It fits the phone correctly and gives the screen a bit of buffer room if you drop it face down.  My problem with the case is the printed design.  It's pretty and not blurry or anything, but it is only printed on the back side of the case.  It does not wrap around the side of the back piece like the picture shows.  In fact, it has an uneven margin of blank space around it on the back alone. The entire case is the same bright white, unlike the pictures (which show it as being brighter where the design is) which is nice.  All in all a good case."
LOVE IT!!!! I wanted a case that said &#34;me&#34; and took several days searching for just the right one.  Saw this and fell in love!  And I love it in person even more!
I absolutely love this phone screen protector. It made my screen resolution even better looking on my galaxy 5S. I would buy these screen protectors any day. It was a great product. It was very easy to put on my phone and also no air bubbles!! Great screen cover.
Packaged great.  Comes with everything needed.  Will purchase for ofher phones and tablets.
Delivered timely and they work great.  Good value purchase and vendor
Love the color and the port covers on the case. The silicone isn't as thick as it appeared in the photos but still works well. I appreciate the tool provided to open the case. It's nice not to have a bent or broken fingernail trying to pry a case open. Overall I would definitely recommend this item. Also like the stand on the back of the case to sit it up while watching videos.
it is OK. quality is fine. A bit stiff and kind of awkward to constantly open and close it ..
"Got this product for free in exchange of my review.  I love it because I can charge 2 devices at the same time, without using all the outlets. There' a lock/unlock button for kids safety and less bulk to carry."
"while it was adequate for the price paid, the phone cover case is not the highest quality.  Have not used the car charger yet."
"Charges my phone just as fast as an in wall phone charger, and the blue light looks awesome at night."
"These work really well. They fit on my head nicely, have good sound quality an I love the color. The range is pretty great too."
"Good Strong micro usb cord at a great price.  We go through dozens of chargers cords over various devices, with small children hard on pluging and unplugging items they easily bend and break.  So far after a week this one is holding up and looks like it will be around for some time.<br />Cord received in exchange of an honest review"
"Everything works well. The phone is almost brand new, and it works perfectly. The charger is also good."
Cord is a little thick. Doesn't wind as nicely as previous purchase of another brand but love the two in one connection.
"These lenses are great, but unfortunately they don't stick very well :( It would be awesome if there were a more permanent way to put a magnetic ring on the phone, otherwise, the stick on rings just pull off. Otherwise, the lenses are great!!"
"It's thicker than I would like, as it basically doubles the phone's thickness. But it's good quality. Fits perfectly with Lego pieces. I bought a Lego car and use the pieces to have the phone video camera roll smoothly. It's great!"
"This watch is very nice looking.  The directions are useless.  I finally got it to sync with my phone, but don't ask how I did it.  I like the watch... But I still have a lot of setting up to do.  There are really no instructions on line to help.  I would recommend shopping around."
Exceptional protection for phone. A little bulky but that's ok. Easy snap out option when you have to take the phone out if clasping it onto a belt or pocket.
"Headset came with wrong charger, and does not charge when plugged in with another charger. Had to use my phone charger to care and still doesn't work. It looks good though like the design."
Amazing quality product!!!  I ordered a second set because I love it so much!  You will love it.  I use all four connectors and the cable is totally tangle free!  Love it!!!
"Recently went on a cruise and used this for my new iPhone 6 whilst snorkeling! It works great, no damage to my phone whatsoever. Water tight seal and for a great price."
"Shipped pretty quick.. the only issue I noticed on my N7pro tablet the black boarder around the glass are a little thicker than the original, which prevents you from seeing icons at the very top of the screen such as battery power and wifi icons. If you tilt the tablet you can see the icons under the black boarder. Other than that it worked and looks way better than the cracked screen."
"Did what it is supposed to do but is kind of like a gas gauge on an old car... Says it is halfway charged for a while, then seems to drop off to empty very quickly. Can charge a Samsung S4 about 1.5-2 times"
Slim protective and light. Works like a dream and the s pen is easy to pull out. It's about the thickness of a regular tpu case
NOT a 2.1A charger as advertised.  ONLY 1A.  very disappointing.
"For 30$ below this is a no brainer. Ive been using this for walks and its been great so far. For the price its a very good deal. I have several headsets like astro gaming headsets, bose, beats and so on."
"I really love the fit of these and they stay in place well. However, the sound quality is poor. If speaking to someone on the phone, I can barely hear them, and I have to turn the volume all the way up for a moderate music volume.But for the price is good"
"I Bought it for my husband's phone.  He likes the fact that it does not add bulk to the phone.  Fits well, not slippery, and protects it."
"I love this product!<br /><br />It came in two days (I live in Northern California) and the company was even nice enough to include two screen protectors. I was a bit nervous whether the product would be cheap and flimsy, but was presently surprised that it is exactly how it like looks in the picture. Feels great in my hand and does not make my ph me bulky like some cases do.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps potential buyers."
Solid pair of headphones. The top band is soft and the sound is great and the earphones are clearly labeled &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;. One extremely frustrating thing: These some with a piece of cloth that says LIMITED EDITION across the top. I bought these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
cute make my phone blingbling phone👍👍thnk you for this liitle and cute things.<br />I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.
"In-expensive replacement headset. Shipped from China.  Faster shipping than expected. Not great battery life, but they do work as advertised."
"This watch is so great, I love it!  It does exactly what I expected:  tell time, answer texts, receive alerts, track health data and look great!  The battery usually lasts around 23-28 hours on a single charge, so just leave it charging while you're sleep and you're fine."
A+ thank you
The worse thing I ever bought was this speaker. I totally regret buying this speaker. I bought it to listen to music at work. I work around cars so you barely can hear it. Had I known it was not loud. I would have never ever bought it. Its good for having it around an office but not outside. Plus the charger falls right out the back of the speaker if moved around. You really have to be close by if your using bluetooth on your phone. It does not work that great. An easy way to waste your money is buying this junk. I have a smaller portable speaker I bought for $25 which sounds louder than this speaker. Save your money on something better.
Came as described  clear  boxed showed abit wear and tear but all in all not back good head phone for my use.  Easy to connect  and wear  . I have funny shaped ears  so I used the large buds  these fit good for me  clear  box came with all contents  like new. No wear and tear on headphones  great buy
"After using one of these forearm armband I had to get another one for my husband so he can have his phone on him when he is at the gym. This armband is much better than any other phone carriers we have used in the past. This band is like an oversized watch only its your phone, this is so much more convenient. My husband needs to be near his phone for all his business emails and text, instead of fumbling around his pocket or taking it off of his upper arm its right there where he can just respond quickly. The band material is soft, it protects the phone from sweat and the material does not irritate our skin. He has put his ID, credit card, cash, his car key and his phone, it is still comfortable even with all that in the band."
"The case has cracked in an unusual place on the back.  Not at a corner, not at a stress point, just a small crack that catches on my son's pocket.  Because it<br />catches, I'm sure the whole back will crack soon.  Not for long term use."
"Nothing to review here. They are simple, basic RCA patch cords that work. Just choose the right length and order them."
"Couldn't ask for anything more out of a phone case! Fits the the Note 4 perfectly. The buttons respond instanly and the case looks amazing because of how slim it is, would definently recommend it for a Note 4."
"Works, but does make your phone warm.  This was with a Nexus 5.  I'm a big fan of Anker products and have several, but this one is just ok.  If you want to maximize your non-replacable battery's life by avoiding excess battery heat, I would not recomend this."
I give this product for stars because it can't be used with a phone case. When you plug it in to your phone with a case it doesn't get proper connection. It's a pain to have to keep taking you case off and on just to use the product
"Sound good base not as good as I thought but highs sound great crisp and clear, I am satisfied especially for the price!!"
This cover is super
"Great bracelet compared to what Apple charges, and the only one (that I've found) that tapers into the watch instead of using a loop connector for the bracelet.  Came in a beautiful retail box and included a tool for DIY link removals, although the tool broke on first use (that's okay I have my own tool).  It also came with a screen protector although mine arrived cracked due to poor packaging.  The bracelet itself is of good quality and is even tighter fitting than the original Sport band.  Be aware, however, that the dark bracelet doesn't match the color of the Sport case (see pictures)."
The best. Love that I can maneuver the part that holds my phone pretty much any which way and it's very sturdy.
This 2 port quick charging car charger also includes a high quality lightning cable. The lightning cable included is the premium version that Anker offers. The charger has 2 ports that can deliver quick charging speeds with Ankers Power IQ technology. The devices are automatically detected when plugged in for maximum speed. This allows you to charge a tablet or phone at high speeds. You can even charge both at the same time. I was sent this product at a discount provided I give an honest review.
I bought this as a gift for my friend and he absolutely loved it. The leather strap with the golden dial absolutely makes this smart watch stand out from other watches. The quality seems pretty good too though I didn't get a chance to test it. The box is which it came was also pretty great. I loved that box.
"After using it only a handful of times the volume is no longer where it once was. It is barely audible now.  When I first turn it on after a full charge, it is fine....for 10-15 seconds.  After that the volume decreases to the point that it is worthless.  I didn't expect a tip of the line speaker for the price, but I did expect something that would work more than 5 times before becoming garbage.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product. Spend $10 more for something that'll last a little longer."
Awesome product!  Will charge my phone several times.
Pretty good.  Just wish the armband portion was a bit narrower.  I like that it is very roomy.  I don't like the band across the middle inside the pocket that makes it dificult to get my iPhone in one-handed.
I got mint and pink.but the colors are not same as picture.the mint color has more green.hot pink is more darker than picture.I would not buy if I saw on offline market because of colors.case qualtlity is better than I thought.
"This case is good. Waterproof, and if u drop it on the face it won't break. Its meant to be used for hiking swimming,  and stuff like that. But you cant charge it inside the case like lifeproof cases. Or use any side buttons. But its a good case."
Love these headphones. I accidentally washed and dried them and they still work. I have had them for almost a year and they still work great
"I got this product as a birthday gift from my friend. It seems okay and works well. I sent an email to their customer support about settings, and got response within 3 hours on Sunday. All my questions were answered clearly. They also provided me a link of their latest firmware. I am very satisfied with their product and customer support."
"This case is cute. Probably not the best for protection, but it's good for looks."
"Fits alittle small on the 6 plus and has a rainbow looking sheen in certain light, otherwise it does what it's supposed to"
"I love this product. At first two of my devices wouldn't locate the CoolStream Duo and I was a little disappointed and ready to ship it back, but I gave it a second chance and they located it and paired without a problem since."
"Perfect replacements for my magic mount! I cant comment on the color matching with the iphone as I bought the gold ones for my gold Samsung S6 edge+. It is no where near the same color. (Which i figured when I ordered it) but still blends better then black would have. Also, wireless charging and NFC ability does not seem to be negatively effected while using the smallest plate."
Cords are what they say they are and work just like they should. would buy again.
"I only had it for a few days but I took my Google Nexus 4 in the case on a long ride and the case was as good as advertised. It was water and weatherproof while still allowing you to operate the phone just as easily as if there was no case. Takes a little work to put all the spacers in to fit your phone perfectly, but once that's done it's great. The installation directions were a little confusing and I didn't understand that the hand-tightening screw on the mount is totally necessary to secure the case, so on my long ride I lost the case four times in the street. It took that damage without any problems and my phone took no damage at all. Then I finally figured out the purpose of the screw and it worked perfectly for the rest of the trip.<br /><br />Today I absentmindedly forgot to secure the screw again and lost my phone in the middle of a really busy street, then it got directly run over by an SUV. The case is dead but my phone is, amazingly, completely fine. I think that's the highest possible recommendation I can give."
Nice case only issue it gets dirty fast and doesn't clean well.
"the edge part is left exposed so if not careful its easy to be taking pics,  making calls and opening other apps without realizing it. I dropped mine on the ground from about 3 feet and right before it hit the ground the flap flew open....resulting in a phone belly flip and shattered screen. $380 in repairs later- I wish I had spent a little more for some extra protection. 1 good thing- the case snaps onto your phone after u trajectory the back off, so it doesn't get hot when it charges (like phones do with many rubber/plastic cases)."
This is very effective screen protector that is cost much less than the brands offering lifetime warranties and prices at around 40.00. There are three protectors included for a fraction of the cost of other brands so in essence you are getting a much better value considering most warranties on the single protectors (at a greater expense) require a shipping fee of at least 6.00USD per claim. So 40.00 + 18.00 = 68.00 vs. less than 20.00.<br /><br />The installation of the screen protector is very simple but you should clean the screen completely before installation.
"If you're looking for a cheap Bluetooth adapter for your car, the Mpow Streambot Mini will do. It's small, light, and will operate for several hours without charging. Setup is straightforward: just hold down the play/pause button until the light starts blinking red and blue. Put your phone into pairing mode and you're set. From there, it's downhill.<br /><br />While the audio quality is fine, the BT antenna in this unit is horrible. If your phone is more than a foot away from the receiver you will get drop-offs. The antenna is even worse if you intend to put the receiver in your pocket as your body will attenuate the signal, making it unusable in the gym. There's no pin or clip on the device to fix it to clothing, making the problem worse.<br /><br />The Mpow Streambot Mini is useless for anything other than audio alone. There's a notable delay between the audio transmitted by the phone, and what you will hear in your headphones. When watching video, the delay will make everything you watch look like a badly dubbed Godfrey Ho flick. If you're listening to music, podcasts, or audio dramas, however, the delay isn't an issue.<br /><br />As a general BT receiver, the Mpow isn't great. You get what you pay for. If you just want something cheap to put in your car, this will work fine."
"Easy to snap on. Darker than it looks on the picture here. But under lighting or outside you can see the purple. Looks more pink on here. I got the $2 case, which does have a little use to it. Some wear around the edge on top and side. But for the price and just to have a  nice hard plastic protector it's good enough for me."
I bought this item two weeks ago and just received it. As I opened the package I noticed that I did not receive an original Cailifu Tempered Glass. It does not even have the Cailifu packaging.
"The frosted clear case looks excellent and shows off the finish of the phone well. The case doesn't block the camera lens, flash, charging port, or headphone port. The phone case is not rubbery, so it does not &#34;stick&#34; or &#34;grab&#34; when placed inside of a pocket or purse. The material does not feel cheap or hard. In fact, it has a semi-soft feel that feels satisfying to the touch. The blocky lines on the back of the phone are the only love-it or hate-it feature about this phone. I'm pretty neutral on the design, but some may think it makes the phone look too masculine or rugged.<br /><br />Pros:<br />soft touch materials<br />fit and finish<br />price<br />high quality<br /><br />Cons:<br />None"
Love the look and versatility of this case. Not bulky and it cuts need down for carrying a wallet most of the time. Completely satisfied!!
"Everyone in our home when sitting in the front of our 2011 Nissan Quest, loves to get our screen on the GPS/Radio dirty. I ordered these, prepared and cleaned the screen and installed the screen protector. It is so easy to clean now and does not show the fingerprints or marks that it had previously. I highly recommend them for any vehicle, given the little cost to these."
"Beautiful case...its a little thicker than the standard one and of course gets rid of the water-resistance. I would give this 5 stars....but it really wrecks all signal coming into the device, I had GPS problems constantly, wireless charging is a joke....I am really disappointed because I really thought this was a super nice looking backplate."
Well this case work well like a cute case. It's not extremely safe but for a Woman phone is the right case. If you want more safe you dont buy it.
"Sleek,elegant and nice feel. Amazing price and delivered quickly."
"EDIT 10/31/15: I've changed the rating to a &#34;4&#34; now instead because of the excellent customer service the seller / vendor has offered.  They saw my review, and sent me a different headset that has a better fit for my needs.  I can't really change what I've said about this set here though since the fit really isn't universal.  I'd still warn buyers to beware if you have a smaller head!   Where do I start with how awful these things fit?  The design of these headphones is one that seems to require a person with a larger head (no offense to those of you whom this thing actually fits!).  My head is pretty small so I think they ended up not having the proper tension as a result?  Not sure?  Just pure BAD design?  Hey, I'm ok with the fact that all of us got a different sized noggin' but you can't market something as a &#34;universal&#34; one size fits all if it doesn't!  What's worse is when I tried using them while jogging they would always pop out of the end of the ear canal and then rest in a spot of the ear that was very uncomfortable / borderline painful.  Also when this happens the sound quality suffers as a result.  I've seen so many positive reviews of this product and I'm sure it works fine for people with the right size head, but beware of what I mentioned above if you plan to jog with them and have a smaller sized head.  Thank you seller for a no hassle return."
"Unfortunately, this product came just as others had reported. It doesn't fit properly. I contacted Amazon customer service and they offered to send me a replacement case. I received the replacement case and it was defective just like the original one. I don't understand why they are selling it on here if they know that it is damaged. Don't waste your time."
Looks like it's made in China. Mirror for the 6 is a lot smaller. Stones are spaced out and very cheap quality
The phone is showing small water spots underneath the outer glass of the phone
Product as described and work
I love  my  new phone  case ..
This case was exactly what I expected and more. It's sturdy and good for if you want to tilt your phone to watch a show at work or movie. Big thumbs up to the people who I bought mine from they went above and beyond to make sure I got my product even after it went to my old address. It was mailed back to them and with a quick email they had it sent to the correct address . Completely my fault but they took great care of me. WILL BE BUYING MORE IN THE FUTURE
Best USB cables I ever owned!! Love them and so does my family. They are so sturdy and well made.
"Had some issues with the cable not working but emailed them and they helped refund me so I can purchase a new one. The cables are a lot nicer than Apple ones, and this is the first time this has happened. Hopefully it wont happen again but I really do like these cables!"
"[[VIDEOID:ec5727b1609c4442587a0b909e25a765]]Excellent Dashcam for the price you pay for it . Less than a 100 bucks including a 32 GB Class-10 Sandisk Ultra Micro-SD card, and an adapter? Thank you - that's awesome..!!<br /><br />*** Watch the driving footage in 1080p here on youtube : http://ow.ly/RxSUt ***<br /><br />VIDEO / AUDIO QUALITY<br /><br />The 150° wide angle f2.2 lens does a great job. The max resolution on this is 1080p / 30 fps, with options of downgrading it to 720p, WVGA and VGA. In daylight, the number plates of the vehicles on your lane and adjacent lanes, and in some cases even the ones parked by the side of the road, are absolutely clear without any squinting required. The night time footages are good, but requires some close observation to get hold of the distant number plates. But I would say at this price-point, its better than a lot of other similarly priced dashcams you would see in amazon. The stability of the videos are just great, not even a file I could find that you can call a shaky footage.<br /><br />One great thing to note here is that the windshield mount has a swivel facility, which allows the camera to be turned around to you, if you want to capture the footage inside the car, or even further turned towards the window, if you wish to tape the conversation with someone standing beside the car. I think its worth mentioning here, because I often see this feature being asked for in dash cam forums and even in amazon Q&As.<br /><br />This one also has excellent mic too, which I often find missing even in the costlier dashcams out there. The car noise and conversations are captured with ease, even the ones from the backseat. You might want to turn it off in the settings, if you are not comfortable with that.<br /><br />MENU / CONTROLS<br /><br />You can find a good degree of camera controls on the menus, which helps customise various aspects of the camera like:<br /> - Display-On time (screensaver) - Off / 30 / 60 Sec<br /> - Video Resolution - 1080p / 720p / WVGA / VGA<br /> - Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) On / Off<br /> - Manual / Auto Power-on<br /> - Loop Recording (2 / 3 / 5 Min, Off)<br /> - Motion Detection Sensitivity (Off / On)<br /> - G-Sensor Sensitivity (Low / Medium / High / Off)<br />  ==> Note : Depending on the settings above, all the footages wherein a jerk is detected, gets locked and moved to a folder by the name \\""RO\\"". These files won't be overwritten during the loop recording process.<br /> - Delayed Power Off/On (10 / 20 / 30 Sec / Off),<br /> - Mute Microphone, Exposure/White Balance etc...<br /><br />All in all, a great Dashcam I would say - go for it if you are in the market for one.<br /><br />Disclosure : Review unit provided by the vendor at no price, for constructive feedback.

Great quality and as described.  This has a solid fitting for micro usb ports which is important because of the weight of the cord is a little heavier than normal because the length and material it is made of.
I wanted a case that would allow me to keep a white back but with a good grip along the edge.  This case fit the bill perfectly. I highly recommend it.
I can get 5 charges for my Samsung Galaxy S2 on a single charge. It recharges quickly and I love that it has two charging ports. It's a little bulky but that's a fair trade off for the amount of charging it can do.
This is a great little GPS and is a great value for the price! I have used it a few weeks now and really like it!
Would have given 4 stars if it didn't keep falling off when it catches onto something. Overall feels like a cheap piece  of plastic but good thing is that it's not noticeable.
Got one for every member of the family.  Provides excellent stability particularly when using speaker phone.  Accommodates the phone with a protective case.  It is also sturdy enough to support a tablet.
Hard to get them to stay in.  Maybe my ears are not like others. I went with beats instead for a guaranteed fit and they never come off.
"Didn't work at first, so I took the fuse out and put it back in and it came right on."
I bought this for my mom and she loved it it's a excellent case over all it's like a mini wallet with a phone attached.
Its cute. But thays all its good for is looks. No protection. None.
Not as sturdy as its predecessor
I ordered 2 of these based on the reviews to give as gifts.  I purchased them in April and just gave one to my daughter the other day. She charged it once and used it for one day. When she went to recharge ti the unit was dead. I gave her the second unit and went online to return the dead one. I was informed that the return period (30 days) had expired. I will return to write a review of the second unit but as of now I would give this product a no-star review and would be somewhat circumspect about ordering this product.  UPDATE: It would seem that the defect here is mine...the charging cable used was defective. When my daughter swapped out the cable the unit recharged without issue. The company contacted me shortly after I placed my review so I can report that they are responsive to customer concerns.
"This is an amazing extended battery case. It lasts longer than my Mophie and PowerSkin. It's also thinner. Very unique design. Rather than charging a depleted battery, it just simply doubles the battery capacity. I agree that you do lose that water resistancy since the case does not do that. As for protection, I dropped the phone twice and the case protected it very well. Another note is that the case is slippery for the white back covers. I am not sure about the black covers. They might be better in grip since they are made differently. Other than that, all ports are accessible and it charges back to 100% pretty quick."
LUUVVITT!!! Doesn't offer much protection as it is thin and flimsy. But it's exactly what I was expecting it to be!
"like the design, I can put id and key in. But the build quality is bad, broke within one week."
"I bought this phone for my husband. He loves it! The phone is well made, and the handwriting inputs of foreign languages are fast and accurate."
"[[VIDEOID:54911cab9de5b1c56e1a9619f23aa917]] The Dash Cam, Eachine AT55C 2.7 Inch Car LED DVR Road Dash Video Camera is a great sub 100 dollar Dash Cam.  Nice 2.7 inch LCD display.  1080p video recording and 170 degree wide angle lens for getting the whole road in the shot.  The dash cam has WDR for night shots and an LED light to assist in night still shots.  The Dash cam supports HDMI output (via Mini HDMI).  Supports up to 32GB Micro SD cards for storing files, and also has loop recording built in so that it will overwrite your oldest file.  Built in microphone for capturing sound as well. The is an emergency \\""lock button\\"" on this model that allows you to lock a current video file so it will not be overwritten during the loop recording.  The G-Sensor will also lock an active file if there is a shock to your car (i.e. you hit something or it hits you).  The unit has a built in Li-polymer 400mAh battery.  The mount that comes with it is nice and sturdy, the suction cup did well on our windshield to hold the dash cam rock solid.  Install is simple and only take a few minutes to run the cord from the 12V adapter  (12V to MINI USB) up to right underneath the rear view mirror.  We were up and running in about 5 minutes.  You can also attach this dash cam to your computer to use as a PC camera or to use as mass storage to access the files without having to remove the Micro SD card.  The outside day time footage (attached as video in this review)  was excellent for the sub 100 dollar price point.

"EDIT: I dropped it once and it broke apart into separate pieces. It can be put back together but it's very cheaply made. Not worth your time or money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-2 USB ports, great if two people need to charge their phones but you only have one outlet in your car<br />-comes with both a USB mini and lighting cable (I'm an android user but most of my friends are Apple users so that's pretty convenient)<br />-The cables have different coil sizes so you can identify which cable you're grabbing by feel alone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The cables are very short. I use my phone as a GPS when I'm driving, which drains the battery quickly if it's not plugged in at the same time. There's no way I can use this cable to charge my phone while using it in this fashion. I plugged the USB cable into my computer tower and the cord wasn't even long enough for me to rest my phone on top of the tower while it charged, I had to rest my phone on the floor.<br /><br />The cables would probably work best if you need to plug your phone into your laptop for charging or transferring images/docs. They're really too short for anything else.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for the purpose of providing feedback in the form of an unbiased written review. My review is based on my honest opinion and experience with this product."
Impossible to get phone out of case after great difficulty getting it in. Power cord is different than iPhone cord meaning you need both if you want to use phone without battery back as I do under certain circumstances.
"I love the case itself and as others have mentioned, did not care much for the screen protector. Not a big deal for me. Hey, it was under $10 with shipping. How can I complain about that. Love It!"
"Until now I have a always liked my OtteBoxes.  Unfortunately this one has had multiple coverings fall off, so far they just appear to be decorative and it appears there a be a small crack forming between the camera and flash opening.  At first I liked the case but these problems have not taken long to show up."
"Fits perfectly on my Lumia640 cell phone.  The buttons still work on the sides, and the cutouts are great for the camera, speaker, headphone jack, mic and power."
"It works, but totally wipes out FM radio reception on all but the strongest stations."
"It does everything it says it will do except the range it gives is absurdly overly optomistic.  It goes through the battery very fast.  I thought that I should go for something better than the very cheap solutions to send my mp3 player through my car radio.... I wish I would have tried one of the cheaper solutions first.  If you are looking for something to broadcast your home audio player to a portable radio while you are mowing and have a decent sized lawn (1/2 acre) you will be disappointed by this product.  (I have tried all of the settings, and gone through the whole channel range)."
"Charges very fast, nice quality and look"
"While not a ultra high end tweeter,it really will surprise you,im using these in factory locations in a 2015 Ford Transit Connect,these use the supplied passive crossover ,and match fine to my CDT QES-680 6.5&#34; woofers also in stock locations,these run open,(no passives),and are powered by a Linear Power 2250. Ultra clean detail,im very particular when it comes to my high end,and these really surprised me,handle power nice. Granted they dont give the airyness of a 500.00 tweet,but at they're price point,you cant go wrong. Wire them in,tune,and enjoy."
"Just what i wanted, nice and quick Thank you !"
"Must say I was a bit skeptical but wow I love this little device especially because it tracks my sleep went swimming in it, and I don't have to worry about the battery as much as I did with my fit bit one.  Overall I'm loving my Misfit Shine and not to mention the whine color I choose matches my many wardrobes. Love it!!!"
I thought these would be good they look fine and the customer service is well really wonderful. So good that after getting a dud cable in the first box I was ok with having the box switched and another 4 cables for another try. Well currently I have 8 cables 4 of them are broken and 4 of them are new siting on my desk. Unless they want to mail me a cable once a week I can't keep them and the cable that is working right now I don't want to hold on to until I am past the 30 amazon return day. Simple they are going back. Also one of the silk screened logos are smudged so I wonder how much quality control there is.
"My iPhone 6 with a hard shell Otter Box is huge, as far as phones go and finding belt-case locally in Houston was impossible, so I found this case here and liked the reviews. It's a snug case and you really have to push the phone all the way down for the magnet lid to close completely. The quality of leather is fine, the belt clip sturdy, and it looks professional. I would buy it again."
Fits good in the radio's cd slot. But the phone swivels around. Swivel is weak. Needs to b stronger. Over all I am happy with my purchase
Gives the phone a little extra hefty but the battery life is fantastic. I can go three days on one charge.
Son uses every day Give a AAA rating. Awesome unit
"Amazing case!! I love this 'Caseologist' case, it's a thin design but it has that 360 bumper protection so it's 'pretty perfect' ! :)  I personally like the &#34;luxury&#34; look and most of all of those types of cases don't have the protection of a Otterbox. Being a mother of three and a entrepreneur I really appreciate those features, even my husband gave it a thumbs up an he's a Otterbox only case choice guy. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.!"
"These protectors for Galaxy S5 are very good for the price and they seem comparable to another brand that my son got at twice the price. Fortunately no experience or comment on impact protection.  The biggest shortcoming was that the Tech Armor instructions state that when installing the protector, just lift and reapply it to correct misalignment.  NO, when we did that,it left unsightly void/bubbles that we could not squeegee out.  Fortunately Tech Armor honored their satisfaction warranty and provided replacements!  If you check the support videos on the Tech Armor website, there is a video with a better method for installing the protectors that assures precise alignment by first taping on one edge the protector including protective layer in the exact location you want, flipping it up to remove the protective layer, then flipping it back down into permanent position.  That video method is better than the written instructions since alignment by eye required better hand coordination and fine vision than we had. It did take several emails and waiting to get the warranty replacements.  Protectors work and look fine at a good price and Tech Armor fulfilled its warranty."
"This product is absolutely amazing, it meets or exceed all of my expectations, and there's just one thing I want to say.  This charger works flawlessly through my Otterbox Defender on my Galaxy S6 Active.  As long as the phone is fairly centered on the pad, it works great."
Best non-tempered screen protector I have ever used. Added plus that it comes with two fronts and one back. Easy bubble free application. Optical clarity is excellent.
Battery last just as long as the original battery that came with my LG G3 which is all I could ask for. I honestly can't tell the difference unlike with other batteries I've used. I highly recommend this battery to anyone in need a spare or replacement battery. My only regret is not buying the two pack and saving a few dollars.
"I bought this in June 2015 and started wearing it the 3rd of July, I was amazed when it came it had no packaging and was floating around with only instructions and its charger in a UPS envelope. But it worked so I let that go, 3 days ago it broke (syncing issues, tried to restart the band and using all the online tricks to fix it) and nothing helped. I should add the Jawbone band would also lose my phones constantly and all my data regularly - but I'd always just work with it because it was so expensive. The band wasn't what I had expected, too glitchy and uncomfortable. Yesterday I bought the low end FitBit (Flex) equivalent to the Up 24 and I already see a huge difference in quality. Tracked my sleep better, much more comfortable on, battery doesn't start dying right away, and I like the app a little more, though the Jawbone's app was its best feature. Hope this helps someone else decided between the two and not waist $ like I did"
This is a horrible product. Very noisy and constantly dropping and adding to charger. Each time it drops or adds or finishes charging it beeps. Makes charging on night stand irratating.<br /><br />Additionally finding cases or adapters to charge devices is difficult. Duracell and the PMA do not understand apparently that the purpose of wireless charging is to not have to plug it in. So the addition of a battery or circle charger is just stupid.<br /><br />Qi is the way to go without a doubt. Would never have purchased this device if at@t did not force it by stripping out Qi charging on LG G3.
This item blows it does not work there is no contact information I can't get ahold of anyone I want my money back does no matter what I do to it it will not work
It holds the GPS safely. But I wish it was bigger to hold everything I brought to go with the GPS.
I like the protected it's self looks and feels great but the corners of the protect don't wanna stick to my phone.
These tips are great and last a long time.
"Nice looking case, but arrived late. It isn't super protective, but I would have given 4 stars if it arrived timely."
"Bought it for my cousin as his old one was broken. It's the same one he had bought in a store for $80, but I got it on here for more than half of what paid, great deal!"
Keeps gripping through hot and cold. Very easy to insert the phone and to get it out. Bought several of these as presents after testing out
"Awesome cable. I purchased it to use for flying my Phantom 3 drone, since the OEM cable is too long and looked messy when wrapped. I have used this cable over 10 flights on my DJI phantom 3 plugged to either my iPad Air 2 and also iPhone 6 Plus with no issues to report. Would definitely recommend to purchase, especially if your looking for a shorter cable for flying the DJ drones."
"I like the look and it monitors quite well.  It DOES NOT have a smart alarm as most of the reviews I read said.  That is a top feature I wanted.  The app is nice (I have an Galaxy S6).  I am hoping for updates to include that smart alarm.  For now I wear my old Jawbone Up for that purpose.  Got tired of replacing my UP, so tried the Misfit."
"Nice big magnet, fits nicely into my cd slot, makes the smart phone look almost like a built in navi system"
"Sturdy, long-lasting screen protectors. The wet application makes it fairly easy to apply and reposition if needed. The hardest part is separating the backing from the screen protector before applying - wish there were a little tab on the backing to get things started. That said, I will keep ordering these as needed in the future."
"It's an amazing smartphone with surprisingly great camera, however, I ordered the L10 version but I got L00 version and it took me some time to get rid off all the Chinese applications, but not a big deal. I love my Huawei!"
The  Item I order from Amazon is very good
It works to hold the phone....after that I am not liking it.<br />The band does not stretch to accommodate any flexing of my arm muscle.<br />This makes it uncomfortable.
I didn't like the way it feels it don't fit my phone good at all. And I would like to have my money back. This case sucks. Don't get it.
"The product is a total disappointment to me as,<br /><br />Firstly the shipment tracing details wasn't updated in Amazon website<br />Secondly the product cover was not exactly matching with what is available from the retailer and seems to be not a genuine product<br />Thirdly the size of the Bluetooth device was small than the one from the retailer<br /><br />I am planning to return this product back to Amazon"
"I love this arm band Fits perfectly, and has a lot of room to adjust for bigger or smaller arms, which is nice so my husband And I can both use it. Great quality. I love that it also has a little pocket for cash and another pocket for an id or credit card. You can still use the touch screen on your phone through the clear front cover which is nice. The neoprene material is nice while running and working out as it still stays in place while you sweat. I recommend this product to anyone! I revived this product at a discounted price for my 100 perfect unbias and honest review."
Case seems to be tight and well fitting.  Mute button on side stopped working after a month.  Have to take the case on and off to mute the phone. Looking for a new one now.
"Even if they are inexpensive they should last fit more than 1 month of very light use. Cant get them to charge, won't turn on. Very disappointed."
It's lovely and durable as all get out. And the card holder is sweet!
Using for a long time and it's works perfect everything lip to it
"I would have love it, but it seems right side of iphone screen's adhesive is not strong enough.. Meterial looks real glass and the touch is very soft and smooth."
"Just received my case, the blue looks really nice but the the chrome silver part in the back was detached since I got it."
"I decided to participate in Project Fi; Google's only available phone is the Nexus 6, which is of course LARGE. Having dropped other phones before, I was looking for a good case. Outer Box didn't seem to make a case for the Nexus 6, so I purchased this case.<br /><br />The case reminds me of the Outer Box; the Outer Box has essentially 2 cases: a hard plastic case inside a softer &#34;rubber&#34; shell. The Bettle has a hard case similar to the Outer Box hard case, but no soft &#34;rubber&#34; shell. Although that probably diminishes the overall protection a bit (hence the 4 Stars), I don't see that as a major problem. It also has a screen protector similar to the Outer Box.<br /><br />One slight issue is that the cover for the power charging port is very stiff, and occasionally takes a bit of fumbling to it get open enough to insert the charger cable. I imagine that it loosen over time.<br /><br />So far, I have managed to drop the phone both on the concrete driveway and a tile floor (don't ask), with no apparent ill effects.<br /><br />Inasmuch as Outerbox doesn't seem to make a case, I found this to be a very good option, similar in almost every way to the Outerbox, and at about halt the typical Outerbox price. I would certainly buy this again, and would recommend it to those who (like me) are a bit fumble-fingered on occasion"
It's a good case but it's loose in the sides and if dropped it would probably break even with the case on because it doesn't have and shock or bumper protection
"I've owned and used the original 4&#34; version of this cable since I got my 5S almost 2 years ago, which just started to malfunction. I decided to rebuy this cable in the 3' version. Big mistake. Cable would not charge unless held at a very specific angle. It's also very obviously cheaper than pervious versions, evidenced by the thinner cord as others have noted. Not sure if it was a fluke I returned that cable and bought two more (a 3' replacement and another 4 incher). BOTH of those don't function at all. Extremely disappointed in how much Amazon's quality control has fallen."
"I love the case! It's perfect for vacation. It is slim and protective! However, when I talk on the phone the other person has a hard time hearing me. People have described to me that it sounds like I am whispering on speaker phone. Other than that I haven't had any issues."
"Ok product,  I would rate it with 3 stars compare to bose mini but because of price I'm raising it to 4stars"
Very happy with my case. Secure but comes off easily enough when I want to use my phone in my stereo dock. It has a classy matte finish but still slips into my pocket without much friction. Give whoever designed your packaging a raise - not often you see so much care taken these days.
"Very disappointed. I've only used it for two days and it has cracked at the back, without my phone falling or anything."
Perfect little camera with wide viewing angles. Works excellent at night ( no night vision though) . Put it at the top of the license plate without any drilling or additional effort. pretty easy to install. would recommend it to a friend.
"Cheap case, my daughter didn't really like but only paid a few bucks for it."
Great product.  Fully charges my galaxy in half the time of other chargers.
This item mount is wonderful I even brought 2 for both cars. It's strong attaches to most surfaces and the phone doesn't move at all with heavy vibrations. I have a iPhone 6+ with the apple leather case.
"Thse are very nice headphones. The Base is a bit high and not tunable, but otherwise the sound is great for the price. I would recommend these to my friends!"
Really like the way it raps around my phone. Feels great in my hand. The kickstand is a wonderful thing.
Works on very smooth surfaces. On my car only glass is smooth enough for it to adhere. The magnet is at the swivel ball not holding the phone to the mount. Attachment to both the car and the phone is by suction cups. These seem pretty well designed but be aware that on a surface with any texture at all (either the car or the phone) this device will not hold. That is not clear from the description.
It did protect my phone. I dropped the phone and the protector crack from left to right but the LCD display didn't break. At lease save me $100+ for the repair. iCarez sent me a replacement under their warranty with USPS tracking no. ( Need to send picture for prove ). Great product and service.
I got my case today and followed the instructions clearly. I installed the case and I luv it. Going to order one for my husband. Works great. It's lightweight not bulky and the buttons are easy to use. I like the silent button switch it works smoothly. I got the teal and black case and I luv the colors.
Cable fell apart after a few months. Was the cable next to my bed--not abused in any way. At one point the company offered a lifetime warranty and said that they would replace any broken cable. I bought within this warranty period.<br /><br />I contacted the company about the issue. Company offered to refund rather that replace. I replied that I really wanted a replacement--if I got a refund the &#34;lifetime&#34; warranty was then worthless. They wouldn't reply to any of my replies after that. I even said that I would accept the refund.
Please save your money and buy a case that actually works! Mine only charges my phone to 2% when the case is fully charged! Worst $20 I've ever spent!
"I had None of the problem s others reported regarding trouble with the thickness of this battery - I use an Otter Defender Case, NO problem installing, No problem charging with the case on."
"Very sturdy cause.  Just can't carry it in my pants pocket,"
gift
2 cables worked but the longest cable broke with the first use. These cables will not fit a iPhone if you have an otterbox or life proof case.
"The case is waterproof. I when I went to use the ringer button it popped off. I am unable to turn it from silent to on, but I was able to put the little knob back in the hole and I haven't had any issues with having it in the water or shower."
"I'll never program my Baofeng manually again, not that I have this cable.  I downloaded &#34;Chirp&#34; from the internet to my computer and it works great.  Just be sure to have the radio tuned to an inactive frequency before you plug it all in and turn it on, because it starts broadcasting before you run the download program."
Fits my LG phone perfectly as was described. Nice bright purple color & should be durable. Solid value & arrived in just 2 business days.
Crap Battery .. loses charge with minimal usage 3/4 way through the day ... YIKES!  Wish I would have not purchased the &#34;standard&#34; .. thought it would be the same charging power as the battery I had for over 2 years without these kind of issues!
"I like the phone. I was initially concerned about it's size, since I was used to a smaller phone. It took about a week for the phone to &#34;shrink down&#34; and not feel awkward anymore, in other words, I got used to it and now it feels weird when I pick up my old phone. The added real estate makes a world of difference to an old foggy like me, who wakes up every morning with a little less eyesight and a little less hair.<br />As others have mentioned, the sound quality is amazing for such a small device. Now, it's not a heart stopping &#34;boom box&#34; by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds great for what it is.<br />It has a brilliant display from every angle. I have not seen a phone any clearer or sharper at any price.<br />The cameras are pretty good. I've always had cameras on my cell phones, but I hardly ever used them because I'm a hobby photographer and I don't shoot with anything less than a DSLR. However, I can see myself taking pictures with this one from time to time. Coming from me, that'... Read more"
"The UP3 by Jawbone Activity Tracker is sleek in design, yet practical. The corresponding UP app for a smartphone is very detailed and easy to navigate, making accurate records of all activity and sleep. Specifically, the sleep progress feature on the UP app is precise, logging time in minutes and hours of each stage of sleep. Although the appearance of the UP3 is very timeless, the only downfall of the product is the fact that one must reference her UP app to review all recorded activity and sleep, in addition to accessing the up-to-date step activity tracker. Ideally, it would be niceto have a small screen on the actual UP3 band, itself, so that steps and the time can be recorded and easily visible. Implementing the time on the UP3 band would also replace the need for a watch. Other than some minor improvements, the UP3 is a detailed and goal-oriented product to track and follow daily activity and sleep."
"I am very pleased with this screen protector. It was (for me) easy to apply and once on is almost invisible, it actually gave the case of my Apple Watch an added shine! With that said, if you are purchasing the Skin for just the screen of your phone or the Apple Watch it will be relatively easy to put on. However if you are purchasing the full wrap around Skin for the Apple Watch be advised it takes time, manual dexterity and patience! Please watch the videos, read the instructions and follow them to a T!"
I love these ULAK cases!  I have 2 and they are great! Excellent product!
I got this case from Amazon. Lasted about 45 days. The case itself is nice. But the battery played out and my iPhone now doesn't recognize the device when it's trying to charge the phone. Says it's not supported. I tried to return the item but Amazon only has a 30 day policy. I will try the main vendor but I doubt they will fix it. But it's worth a shot.
"I like the idea of having both the quick charge and the standard, but this particular unit does not work very well. The cable that comes with the charger both does not want to stay in the charger nor in the phone. I find I *think* I am charging my phone while driving, when I am not -- only to arrive at my destination without much time left on my phone battery. I would not recommend this unit."
I purchased this item and the first one just stop working by itself. Returned that one and got another one and that one just cuts off by itself.
The case is exactly as described.  Slim and protective.
"Love the idea...  but took me forever to figure out how to work it... Instructions weren't very clear & 3 short days after turning it on, battery was dead."
Broke my back and this was perfect! Great price.
Fit my Droid Turbo perfectly. It has a kick stand which is helpful when I use my phone as an alarm clock. The glow in the dark case is awesome.
These cases are ultra thin and I don't have to worry about my phone being too thick. They are true to color I just wished that they had a red color.
Love this light. 2 brightness levels. I use this with my Kindle and regular books.
"This has to be one of my favorite purchases! this portable external battery pack, has remarkable features that I cant help but to brag to my friends about wheh i go out. I work at a restaurant, and my husband works on the road. So there are times when, neither one of us can use a &#34;plug&#34; to charge our phones. Or maybe we just need a inconspicuousway to charge phones while at work. This product definitley does that for us!<br />Easy to us, Simply plugging in the charger at home yo completely charge the &#34;portable charger&#34; to 100% charge, grab and go. When your ready to charge your device, use the proper cord to your mobile device, turn on the portable charger and vaalaa. Your device can charge in your pocket. AND its fast!! Got to love something that doest take a long time. Whats cool about this product, is it also has a flashlight built in to help see if your in the dark. HIGHLY recommended! thanks for allowing me to recieve this product for a discounted rate, in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
"This stand is great. It works just as you would expect.  It seems a little weirdly shaped, but it is mostly functional. The coils are in the oblong section and it makes it easy to align the phone for optimal contact.  There are rubber place holders at the base which helps a phone find its grip and rest securely without slipping.  The light isn't nearly as bright as other options, but it is bright and ONLY lit when a device is charging - so that's a plus."
Just received mine today. Luv the print!! Snapped on nice and easy. Fits snug and feels like it may be a tad bit hard to pop off but that is what I want...not some flimsy case that falls off and doesn't protect the phone.Cell phones and the services are expensive and if your the type that constantly drops your phone then you should invest in a rubber case to protect your investment. For what I need t for to pretty up my phone it serves the purpose both ways.
"Case feels cheap, small crumbs and skin get stuck in the holes. A small drop will shatter any edge of the case, poor quality due to the structural rigidity of having holes."
Charges my Note 4 five or six times fully before needing to be recharged.  I use this product while I'm working since it charges faster than via the car charger.  I love it!
Very cute when i got it and better quality than i had expected  however 3 weeks of using it and the plastic on the actual case part is breaking apart and the trim around the leather is fraying and pulling apart. Fun for a short time.
"This product fits well, easy to apply and looks clear, color very natural vibrant, just like how iPhone looks without the screen saver! It also has a lifetime warranty! Quite satisfied with the purchase!"
"This case keeps my phone safe, all the while, constantly reminding me of how much I love Paris!"
"I know this is meant for the car, but I'm actually using this on a glass work desk. I don't spend much time in my car, but I'm always at my desk (I work from home), so I thought it would really come in handy there - and it does!<br /><br />The phone holder is tight and secure, yet easily adjusts to and grips any size phone. It holds my phone nicely and doesn't slip or slide. It takes a little effort to attach the phone holder to the base. You may think it will break, but it won't. You'll need a little strength for that. The ball, which attaches the holder to the base, makes it easy to adjust the position of the holder and makes it movable in just about any direction.<br /><br />The base has a sticky bottom that adds an extra layer of stability and keeps it from going anywhere. I'm hoping it doesn't mess up my desk though. There's also a clip that helps to secure the base to my desk (or dashboard if you use in your car). It's also convenient that the piece used to attach the holder to car vents can also be used as a stand. This makes it easy to hold up your phone on any flat surface like a kitchen counter or restaurant table.<br /><br />This is my second product from UnicornTech and both have ben great quality. I've had this holder over a month now and it works just as good as when I first took it out of the box.<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine."
Works great and durable. Was able to put back together after it got stuck in the charger once. Unlike the Powergen charger.
"I want to say up front that I am giving this product only one star because of it's performance with my new phone (Galaxy Note 5), however, if I were rating Rav Power's customer support, they would get 5+ stars!<br /><br />In a  nutshell, this device did not work properly with my Note 5. When plugged into the wall, the charger sill only charge my phone to about 70%, even after being on the charger for 9 hours and starting at 38%! When I unplugged the unit and charged my phone on it from its battery, it worked perfectly!<br /><br />I emailed their customer support and the emailed me back immediately! They sent me another one which arrived in 2 days! They didn't even want me to send the first one back! Unfortunately, the second one performed exactly as the first one did, so I am thinking there is a compatibility issue with the new Samsung Note 5 and 6 Plus Edge.<br /><br />I bought Rav Powers regular (no battery pack) wireless charger and it works flawlessly.<br /><br />Again, RavPowers customer support gets 5+ and I will definitely do business with this comapany again!"
I'm hard on my Bluetooth devices. After trying 13 models this Elite Flip is the BEST.
Came on time. Looks great. Only thing I do not like is it doesn't fit my s5 in it unless the case is off. Snug fit. But definitely like it over all. Pretty small. Can't wait to use it!
"The case was everything that was promised,easy to install and seem sun breakable"
"I cannot tell you how happy I am that I purchased this phone.  Had been using HTC Evo 4G LTE for 18 months, but had to stop updating apps because its memory was full.  Found this at such a great price, read review after review and bought it.  You will want to get a case because this is a super slim and large phone; it feels far too delicate to hold by itself.  And buy the fastest and largest memory card to go with it.  Excellent quality picture and speed, and the sound is as good as they say.  Camera shots are instantaneous and great quality.  Because I updated from an HTC, moving apps, music, pics, texts, etc. was a breeze; they have you use an app that auto transfers everything wirelessly, just tap one button and watch it all move!  Battery is lasting a long time.  The best thing:  My old 4GLTE phone would not find 4G service in my rural area even though VM said it existed; this new phone has 4GLTE service throughout this entire valley.....  LOVE the speed!!  I also was able to use Talkback to read my overdrive books, which I couldn't do on the old phone.  With the auto-updates, it is running Android 5.0.2 and HTC Sense 6.0.  Note:  Before you turn it on the first time, follow the instructions and go to virgin mobile website to set it up.  Then turn it on and activation will be quick and easy."
"Great product,  sound is just right not crazily loud for the kids  Great customer service.  These guys stand behind their product. My son headset broke and these guys replaced no questions asked."
The case is what I expected only think I had a problem with is that the logo faded and fell off in like 1 day but other than that a great case
I'm really dubious of these product reviews. The product is of poor quality and I wouldn't trust my phone in it anywhere near water. It's a low-quality Chinese made product. Even the product packaging was not nice.
One of my favorite cases that covers and protects both front and back. Will be getting different colors in the future.
No problems so far.  It was very easy to put on my phone and fits perfectly.  I've had it for about a month now.
"This is the best case for the Nexus 4.  I've been using it for over 2 years during which I've accidentally dropped my phone at least 4 times...slipped out of my shirt pocket or fell off the kitchen counter.  The phone has landed hard on an asphalt driveway (2x),  bathroom tile floor,  and hardwood flooring... resulting in NO scratches or cracks.  Amazing! Thanks to this case (and a screen protector),  my Nexus 4 still looks brand new."
"Suction mechanism did not work on my vehicle's surface, limiting me to use it on the glass which obstructed my view."
works just as well as an otterbox not even half the price good product
"Device is extremely cheaply made and it only works for phone audio, not for media audio."
Great product!
"I had bought these for this past Christmas and just got around  to reviewing them. They are simply amazing! I had my husband try them as well and he was amazed. I even caught him using them a few times when he couldn't find his set! I have not had any issues whatsoever with these headphones, and I purchased a set for each of my 3 children. Would highly recommend and would not hesitate buying these again if the need arises. Such great quality all around."
"Works, but is only 700 rms at 1 ohm. Way over rated power, not even half the rated rms power. Barley runs 2 type r 10s. Wouldn't buy another one"
"This Choetech dual USB car charger with QC2.0 quick charge port arrived in an environmentally safe box and, in addition to a charger, also included a premium 3.9ft thick 22AWG cable to handle high current without losing efficiency or charging speed.  The unit is very compact at 2.4” x 1.2” x 0.8” and lightweight at about 30g.  Even so it has dual USB ports, it’s still very small around usb port area.  It’s quite impressive to maintain a size of a regular single usb port charger while providing 30W of power with over-current, over-charging, and short circuit protection.<br /><br />When you look during the daylight, you can see QC2.0 port having a blue outline to easy find your quick charger port.  That port is equipped with auto-detect charging which handles 5V @2.1A, 9V @2A, and 12V @1.5A.  A regular usb port next to it is a standard port with a fixed 5V @2.4A charging speed.  But where it gets interesting is in a dark when you look at the backlight.  Without any cable connected, both ports have a cool blue light so it’s easy to find your charger in the car when it’s dark.  When you plug in a cable into a regular charge port, the other open port remains lit up in blue.  When you connect a fast charging QC2.0 port – the adjacent LED turns green.  I absolutely love the visual indication with a different color for QC2.0 charging.<br /><br />There are many car chargers, and I’m sure we are going to see more QC2.0 enabled ones soon.  But a little detail like a background LED light and a changing color when QC2.0 charging in progress is what makes this product stand out from the crowd.  And it's always a good option to have both charging ports because QC2.0 charging is fast and if you have a long drive - the annoying message of &#34;unplug your phone&#34; will stay up.  In a summary, Choetech is a reputable company and offers 18-month warranty on their products, and for under $17 this is another must have product if your phone supports QC2.0 fast charging.  Definitely gets my recommendation."
"Sturdy frame and surprisingly clear given how much it costs. Believe it or not, I'm typing this while driving in reverse on the freeway. Ridiculously quick and easy to install.  For my vehicle, I had to drill a hole in my trunk to allow easy access to my wiring. For those of you that choose to go that route, make sure you put in a rubber gromet in place where the hole is."
after 4 month<br /> three port of usb is not running ...!
"Again, another great case for the price.  I have the same case for my iPhone 6 plus and loved using it.<br /><br />It's sturdy while also providing a nice amount of protection for drops.  The only thing I don't like about these cases is the built in screen protector. Because of the hole around the home button dust and dirt typically get caught underneath the screen. Normally I will pull the screen protector off and replace it with a hardened glass screen protector. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. My recommendation to supcase would be to remove the built in screen protector and provide a hardened glass screen protector in its place. Otherwise I consider this one of the best cases for the Note 4 or an iPhone 6 plus and will continue to purchase for future phones if available."
"Love, Love it! Bought one for my Granddaughter too! I just upgraded my phone, so I will be purchasing another one!"
Im not convinced this is genuine motorola product. It doesnt hold a charge any longer than the 3 year old battery it replaced. it should be an all day battery.
Great
This fits like a glove and keeps the phone still feeling slim.  I have the gold S6 Edge+ with the clear case.  Awesome!
Good service and product!
"I've had this case for about a month now and I love it! This is my favorite case out of all the ones I've had in the past. The color is different in person- I like it more. It's soft, durable, not easily scratch-able and it fits nicely. Definitely a recommend! This is definitely a woman's case because  of the shimmer/glitter on the case."
"For the price it is cute and not that cheap...however, the magnet from the flap that closes it demagnetized all of my debit and credit cards, twice. Just be careful what you put in the slots in the case."
"I thought this cover would have a little bit of texture to give it a more leather feel, but it didn't; spent too much money for a flat finish, plastic cover I could have purchased for 1/3 the price with a little bling or something with a better &#34;feel&#34; to it.  Also, this has a felt interior that holds the heat in the phone and am constantly having to cool it down.  Can't get to the power button easily because of the flap being mostly in the way.  I spent too much for this to toss it so will put up with its faults."
"OK, but to be clear the USB only provides power, no connectivity.  Makes it pointless since you have to still use a cable from input device."
PROTECTS THE COVERS BUT NOT THE SCREEN
"Along with my black tempered glass screen protector for the front of my iPhone 6, this rear protector really makes my phone look it's coolest! Reminiscent of the all glass iPhone 4 & 4s. A really great look for this phone. Not to mention the added protection. Personally, I ordered it for the looks, and I love it. Gonna order a couple more just in case I get a little careless."
It fits very well in my Lenovo A-850 cell phone and protects it fine also.
This case is just perfect in every way.... The buttons operate the phone easily and it doesn't make the phone bulky for carrying in your pocket. Would recommend it highly!
Love this case! Fits perfectly. The design is gorgeous. I get so many compliments. Would definitely recommend this case and seller! A++
"After reading all the positive reviews, I had to try this screen protector. I tried a number of other screen protectors but they fell short, interfering with the phone, causing the screen to go blank. This screen protector is superior to the ones I have tried in the past. It is very easy to install, there is absolutely no &#34;rainbow&#34; on the screen, the image is crystal clear. As promised, the screen protector does not interfere with any of the phone functions and when placing a call or when disconnecting the screen does not go blank. I am happy than I spent a few extra pennies and received an excellent screen protector that goes above and beyond - it does the job well."
I ordered two of these items because I thought they would be handy to have. Neither worked! One of them clearly had a defective USB connection. Very disappointing!
Color started wearing out the same week it came in. Disappointing because the original color (pink) was beautiful
"Structurally,  I am extremely happy with my otterbox. This is the second one I've purchased and it does a great job of protecting my phone.  I do make a couple of modifications right off the bat to make it optimally functional for me.  First,  pop out the built in screen protector. The air gap is terribly annoying and a dust magnet.  I already have an excellent zagg screen shield on the phone anyhow,  so the otterbox one is redundant. It pops out easily with my fingers.  Second, take scissors and cut the flap off the charging port cover.  It puts pressure on the cord and weakens both cord and charging port. Dust in there has never been an issue.  Third,  dremel off the hard plastic guards around the microphone jack. They prevent me from being able to seat the dongle I use to process credit cards for my business. Viola,  well protected phone customized for my needs.<br /><br />My one issue with this otterbox is no structural issue at all,  but an aesthetic one.  I ordered the purple otterbox an expected the usual grey plastic inner shell.  Well,  the rubber portion of the case isn't really purple ...it's blue. I can live with that. The game killer is the retina melting pink of the hard case. Egads!  Had I known that I would have ordered the plain black case.  It makes the phone case garish and unforgiveably ugly. Enter one final modification: I painted the horrid pink black. Now my phone is dressed in a much more tasteful dark blue and black."
"Not a bad strap. iPhone 6 fits fine. There's a flap that goes over the top of your phone once it is inserted I guess to keep out water. The biggest issue I have had so far is with the elastic arm strap. I do not have huge biceps at all but the strap is super tight around my arm. I tried to find another spot to wear it, like on my forearm, but that wasn't comfortable. Other than that issue it's great. Has a place for your key and a credit card or ID which I think is a nice feature in case you're out running/walking and want to stop to get a drink or something. :-)"
"I like the protective case...it fits well.  My two complaints are: 1) The price was too high...I could have gotten it cheaper if I had only done a little more shopping.  2) I wish the company would have sent a protective cover for the face of my phone.  Otherwise, I am well pleased with the product."
Not pleased with the case.
"terrific value for a light weight, elegant iPhone case."
"I don't think you can beat this phone for the price.  In most criteria, it is comparable to phones costing 4-5 times its amount. I was trying to decide between this and the Moto G (for 80 dollars more). I'm glad I went with the E, because it has everything I need, with just a few minor weak points.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Performance-wise, it is a beast. The quad core processor can handle just about everything you throw at it, and I've yet to see it really bog down--perhaps a little bit when I have 20 apps open and have not yet cleaned out the 100k old messages from previous phone. Although, I do not use my phone for resource-intensive apps or gaming.<br /><br />It connects very quickly to WiFi, data, and GPS and doesn't hiccup.<br /><br />Battery is exceptional. Unless you are constantly glued to your phone and streaming music and video, you will get 2 days of normal use with one battery. streaming a 2-hour movie will eat up 30-50% battery. Not too shabby.<br /><br />Physically, they phone feels very nice. Good weight and thickness. I hate the ginamorous phones coming out these days, and prefer something in the 4&#34; screen size, but at 4.5&#34;, this is not too obtrusive.<br /><br />The Motorola Migrate app is very handy and easy to use--made easing into my new phone quick and painless.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Camera sucks. Bigtime. It's like stepping back into 2010. Oh well, not a big deal for me.<br /><br />Screen resolution: probably could be better, though it still seems pretty great to me.<br /><br />Android Lollipop--personally, I preferred Jellybean more, and I've seen some buggy issues with Hangouts and text messaging--not sure if that's the phone or the OS, but I suspect OS."
"Works great and very simple to get started,  the only 2 things that bug me is when I charge my phone with the 1.0 amp port the music playing starts to get kind of a static noise going on. And since the power outlet is close to my cup holder any big drink I put there eventually turns the device off went it bumps into the power button."
"I received this as a free review sample. I have gone through a few generations of these phones, and this one has a lot of refinements.  Note that I have had these since mid May - over three months - and have been using them often. I can honestly say that they are sturdy and mine have not exhibited any issues.<br /><br />There are detailed product specs and a slew of reviews, so I will try to avoid repeating those. The main two things I look for in phones are comfort and sound quality.<br /><br />These are comfortable enough to wear for up to three hours and the buds stay put in my ears. They are not as much noise canceling as noise blocking, but if you are using them while jogging they allow enough ambient noise to ensure that you are always (and safely) aware of your surroundings.<br /><br />Sound is excellent for sports phones. I would not buy these for indoors critical listening - that is not what they are designed for. However, each major frequency band is clear, with a distinct bias towards the mid range, but the high end is crystal clear at max volume and the low end produces respectable bass.<br /><br />I like the controls, but you will find that they do need to be memorized because some of the buttons are used for more than one function. The call and Play/Pause/Stop buttons are the most used and are prominent on the body. Plus instead of holding down a power switch for some arbitrary amount of time, this comes with a simpler slide switch.<br /><br />Overall, a lot of thought went into the improvements of this generation of sports phone. I tested mine with an Android (Note 3 phone and Tab Pro tablet), and an iPhone 2 and newer iPhone Air 2 and these phones worked perfectly with each."
"This is a very cool radio!  It's small enough to fit in your shirt pocket.  It's only 2 watts but powerful enough to hit the repeater in my area.  I have a variety of Baofeng radios but this is one of my favorites because you can charge the battery with the supplied USB cable,  The controls and programming are a lot different than the Baofeng UV-5 but I like how compact this radio is.  This radio does not have any numeric keys because you change the frequency with the rotating knob, but it does have an FM radio receiver and an LED flashlight.  This is a great backup radio that you can fit just about anywhere."
"Been using it only for 1 week so far. Good treble, decent bass, warm sounding., that is good. I am hearing notes previously unheard from former earbuds. Fit is OK, the plugs must be fully inserted into the ear for a snug fit. This will affect the frequency of the sound. All in all, a very good buy, i am extremely happy."
It is very beautiful but the magnetic cover flap is not a very strong is not very good at keeping the case closed.  It would be better with a belt and loop option.
Worked well at charging/running everything we threw at it. Better than others I've spent more on.
"It says Apple certified, but sometimes I will plug in my phone and it tells me that the accessory is not recognized. After I unplug it from the phone and from the wall, then plug everything back in, it seems to work fine. I love the longer length, but not sure if I would trust an Amazon basics product again. I would probably just buy a regular apple product."
New cover looks good. Battery is heavier than I expected but I'm okay with it. Great battery life!!! I never run out of charge even with heavy use. Well worth it.
Great case but don't like the color attachments
"Purchased from several glass screen protection people over the years. It went on as easy as the others. You just have to be careful. Zero air bubbles. The coating for the fingerprints works okay. Other makers feel a little smoother but that is really splitting hairs. Tech Armor has an excellent customer service dept. I have used on other products of theirs. I just wish they made a glass anti glare, now that would be really useful. All in all you can not go wrong with this screen protector no matter what phone you use it on."
I returned this the minute I fit it to my phone.  It instantly doubled the size of the phone and didn't feel like it would stand the test of time.
"The watch I got continuously drops the Bluetooth connection, so as far as using it with my phone it kind of blows.<br /><br />That said, it's still not bad when using it disconnected.  All things considered, $18 for a touchscreen watch with a calculator, altimeter, barometer, sleep monitor, pedometer, stopwatch, and alarms isn't all that bad of a deal."
"I was expecting something a little more durable and sturdier. The black bumper part is not rubbery feeling and the blue is plastic that does not seem sturdy at all. I thought I was going to break it when I snapped it back into place. The screen is an oil and dirt magnet. I used this for about one week and couldn't wait to put my phone in a new case. The opening for the charger made it difficult to keep open long enough to insert the cable. I gave it 3 stars because it is only going to be used as a backup if I need one. I would have returned it, but I did not want to pay another $6 just to do so. I guess I was spoiled with an otterbox when I had the iPhone and thought this would be similar to it. It is just a cheaper version."
"Most people are typically concerned with the safety of their phone, however, people often get bulky cases that protect their phone but look tacky or just aren't convenient on a day to day basis. This case is excellent! It's very useful and the credit slot holds my debit card and my license. This is useful as I don't have to worry about carrying my wallet with me. It is an excellent 2 in 1 accessory. It's very protective and looks stylish. The color is truly unique and the quality is unmatched. I received this product in return for and honest and unbiased review."
Fits perfectly.  Low profile and doesn't increase the phone size too much. Protects the phone.  Doesn't interfere with the camera or ports.  What else could a case do?
"I have been totally impressed by this case. It fits perfectly, it provides an excellent grip and shows off the beauty of my gold coloured iPhone 6 plus from all viewing angles. It is very scratch resistent and protects the phone really well. A great purchase overall."
"This is my second radar detector, and it blows away my other one.  (Beltronics RX65)  Far fewer annoying false hits, and the sound itself is much easier on the ears.  I love that it will let you block out known false hits with a double push of the button.  And, I like the blue light.  Very happy with this purchase."
charges my LG G4 in a fraction of the time of the one that came with the phone
"The case is nice, however one corner does not snap together.  I needed a case quickly, so didn't have time to return it."
I love the way this case fits my phone. Everything is snug but not so tight its a pain. It slides into the clip nicely and holds well. It has a nice slim fit which is nice compared to some which are too bulky. The two part case offers protection for my phone and the kick stand on the hard shell stands up nicely. I would recommend this case to anyone looking for an affordable alternative to an otterbox or the like.
"I love those dresses,but my last order I asked for the color violet and I received the magenta wich is pink l need someone to fix this problem for me, now even if I kept the pink how I am suppose to know the violet is actually pink not as the picture suggests that it deferent color completely !!"
Convenient.  You can carry it in your pocket.  They provide the connector.  It was able to charge my LG Leon 77 percent full.  The only drawback is that it took about 4 hours to do it.
"Great case! It had just enough texture to make it easy to grip.  The buttons function really well, which wasn't the case for my last case. Great protection for corners and the camera. I'd definitely recommend this case.  And I get compliments on how it looks."
Very misleading in the details. Says &#34;rubberized&#34; material but is actual hard plastic.
"Nice adaptor, - well designed. However with some UK plugs ( the upside down ones) - there is not enough room between the plug and the wall to fit them in"
"I bought this case for a small make-up box.  I like boxes that are sturdy and this is great.  Small enough for the basics and great if I ever want to use it for anything else.  Comes with foam inserts, which I didn't use, latches take a bit of pressure to close, but seems to seal tight.  No complaints."
Product was everything I expected.  Price ..reasonable..  - Quality .. Perfect..  Availability..  great. ..  -  Shipping response ..very quick which met my timeline..  I'll be using this provider again and likely soon.
"Pretty useful. These batteries don't charge nearly as fast in the anker charging cradle as the note charges them if youre using the &#34;fast charger.&#34; But they're still amazing as long as you plan ahead and keep one charged up.<br /><br />Great value at this price. Haven't done any serious testing but after a month of daily use, these are still going strong and are pretty much equivalent to the stock samsung battery."
Overall this was a pretty good product. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and I have a very slim case on it and with the case it was an extremely tight fit. Without the case it slipped right in and fit just right. It also was a little bit hard to be able to use the touchscreen but it is still usable. Overall not too bad of the product especially for the price. I would definitely recommend this product to people but keep in mind if you wanted to fit properly and have a larger phone your phone cannot have a case on it.<br /><br />I did receive this product for free or at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and that is what I have given you today.
Bought the case at retail price and was generally happy with it. My only problem is that the top of the case does not cover beyond the phone
very good item
"I love this case. It fits perfect and does not block any parts of the screen with the raised sides to protect the screen. It also is still very easy to press the side buttons even though the case covers them. It is very easy to put on and take off, though fits snug. The only reason I deducted one star is because the picture, which appears to be printed onto a metal plate and then glued onto the back of the case, was (and still is although I've tried to fix it multiple times) bent. This has not affected anything to do with case, it is just a small imperfection that is only noticable upon inspection."
"Bought this case for my guy: he asked for it by name and is very pleased with it. He swears by the brand on many other items so once he learned they had a phone case he was confident about quality, durability and design. He tells me how he was spot on for these high expectations."
"Like another reviewer, this isn't the type of case I normally go for, as I prefer a silicone cover inside a polycarbonate (plastic) shell (like Otterbox's Defender series).<br /><br />I have tried two cases before this ([[ASIN:B00WB8DTLQ ASUS ZenFone 2 ZE550ML/ZE551ML Case - HOTCOOL Heavy Duty Rugged Dual Layer Armor with Kickstand Cover Case For ASUS Zenfone 2 ZE550ML/ZE551ML(Will Not Fit ZE500CL Model), Black]], and the [[ASIN:B00OXRGD8Y MoKo ASUS ZenFone 2 Case - [Scratch Resistant] Hybrid Armor Series Dual Layer Protection - Scratch Technology Corners + Bumper Case for ASUS ZenFone 2 5.5 Inch Android Smart Phone 2015 release, BLACK]]) and I prefer this case over the other two.<br /><br />The main thing I like about this case is that the power button is much easier to press compared with the other two (I cut the case over the power button for the Hotcool and the MoKo was sometimes difficult to press).<br /><br />The sides feel like a vinyl rubber compound similar to the valve for inflatable beach balls (as another reviewer has said), and allows enough of a grip without gripping fabric (as seen with silicone rubber cases). The back is plastic and there's not much to say about it.<br /><br />I was thinking to use the &#34;strap holder&#34; to attach a wrist strap, but I eventually figured that it would break over time and I would end up with a broken screen because of it. The &#34;strap holder&#34; is better suited for cellphone charms in my opinion.<br /><br />One surprise was when I set my phone down with the screen facing up with the camera LED on - fibre optics took over and turned the case into a strange lamp.<br /><br />I can't say for protection as I haven't dropped this phone yet (knock on wood), but I hope I don't have to find out. I also can't say about the design template, as I don't think I'll spend the time to fiddle with it, as my phone's usually screen-up or in my purse.<br /><br />So far, it seems like it's one of the better cases for the ZenFone 2,I only wish I didn't buy the other two cases."
"The case arrived as described and it fit my iphone 6+ perfectly. I was a bit disappointed about the material's apparent flimsiness, but not surprised considering it was less than $2.<br />The shipping was excellent, it arrived very quickly!"
I got this because I needed something to carry my phone and license and a couple credit cards. I didn't want to carry my wallet around to gaming conventions and the like. Just something simple and easy. This case was perfect for that. It fits my phone no issues. Easily fits a couple cards in the back of it. The only downside is that I use a magnet car phone mount so I have to stop myself from throwing it on there as I don't wanna risk the magnet ruining my credit card strips. I did receive this at a discounted price for an honest review but for the full price it's definitely worth it. I love the cases I've gotten from caseguru in the past. Their stuff is always top quality.
"Works well, I love it for long trips."
Great look case but it feels cheap. Real lightweight and is described as a heavy duty metal case but it feels more like plastic. will give it a go and see how it stands up.
Nice case but after I had it for a five months it chipped one of the corners.<br />It now has a white corner.
Holds charge for an extremely long time. The shiny metal ornamental plate between the outlets separated but can still plug in. Fairly small size so that it is easy to place in a computer bag or pocket book or pocket. I have actually not had an occasion to recharge my phone.
"Looks nice. Less then a day and just from reaching in my pocket watch face is scratched. Won't stay connected. (Samsung Note edge) When it is connected no other Bluetooth will work, ex my link in my truck. Overall just not happy. After several &#34;smart watches&#34; I give up. Had a Samsung Gear and won't work with the new phone update. September 18,2015 update. I contacted the seller about how bad the product was and they refunded my money. Good seller bad product."
"I bought this and the Sumaclife Mesh &#60;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T2OEBV4&#62; for my First Gen Moto X. This one is much better, it is perfectly designed for the Moto X - with the headphone jack hole in the right place, and fits the phone perfectly, even with my Seido Case on &#60;http://www.amazon.com/Seidio-BD2-HK3MTXPK-GL-Kickstand-Holster-Motorola/dp/B00EUBRWOC&#62;."
[[VIDEOID:11c14496ceb0af094e5c3c10729578ae]] This is now my go-to battery bank. I used this mainly with my LG G4 and it charged from 30% to 100% in about an hour and a half. That's really good! I also like the compact size and that it comes with a pouch. Mind this was sent to me for free in exchange for my honest opinion and you got it.
"The armband arrived on time and was fully functional for about 2 weeks (I run 4 times a week). Then, after a long run both parts of velcro just fell off. I tried to glue them in place with superglue, but the part from the tip fell off again. There is no way to use it now other than holding it with a hand (or sewing together?).<br />Also, it is not sweat-proof as the description says, the phone is covered in sweat after a run.<br />Total waste of money."
Was what I expected. A very great product.
Horrible . Did not fit my phone
"Didn't work after 3 days, wouldn't connect with my phone and lost connection with my car. The top charger didn't work at all either."
"Save your money. The 1st time  I  used  this product  on my s5, my phone and this charger over heated. I'm disappointed with this product. I only had it 1 day and it doesn't work. What a waste of my money. Save your money! Do not purchase."
The perfect case for this phone. It won't cover the leather backing like the other cases but still offers the same protection.
"Short version:  Don't buy it.  Get the Anker PowerDrive 2. Better build quality, better product, same output, half the cost.  http://amzn.to/1PXZR8Y<br /><br />The details:<br />I ordered two of these, one for myself and my brother along with the PortaPow charging cable.  My brother complained that he couldn't charge his phone in his truck, that every time he plugged in the USB cable and/or phone, the blue light would go off and it wouldn't work.  I thought it was his truck.  Two weeks later, the same thing happened to me in my car."
"I received this case a few days ago and it creates a snug fit for my brother's iPhone 6. It's fairly light, and while definitely not a thin or thick case it has enough protector for drops and shock. I've added a tempered glass front and with that combo I feel it's safe enough for normal wear and tear.<br /><br />The quality of the case is great, since it's rubber it's a bit stretchy unlike the solid cases where you might worry if putting the phone inside the case would scratch up the iPhone itself.<br /><br />I received this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
"Good case, but it significantly effects my cell service. Go from 2 bars to 4 when I take the case off. Also just broke the gorilla glass screen I've had it for a month."
Only lasted one month.  The cell phone will not turn on.  Tried hard reset after charging overnight (pressing volume down and power key for two minutes) but no luck.
The stand broke first day. Made very cheaply.
"The plastic/non-leather portion is much more gold in color than shown in the pictures of the red/burgundy leather option. Everyone I work with calls it &#34;the Ironman case&#34; because of this. Other than it being more comical than I had expected, it's a good case."
I love this watch 4 apps running and you can see them on one screen. What band is permanent unlike the frame so it cant fall off. Great watch will buy more before they run out as they aren't  making these anymore.
"I thinks it's so cute and sleek looking , the only thing that sucks is the regular iPhone lighting charger doesn't fit when the alumni bumper is on , so in order to charge my phone I have to take that off , and at first it was a hassle . So for the most part, I just wear the tpu case . Unless I'm going somewhere"
Good solid adapters. Looks to be exactly what I need. Only star removal is for no grounding. Adapters all plug together for easy transport. Will test while in the UK on a trip and update if any issues found.  *Received a discount for an unbiased review. *
"Great, sturdy case. I've had it for about a month now and it still looks brand new. Definitely recommend."
It broke and I haven't had it long<br />But I love the color it's so pretty and it's nice structure before it broke
i like photo on it and stuff cause its the turtles..but was kinda disapointed it came hard plastic n not rubber like it was sopposed to....n it ruined my phone :/
"I am really impressed with this adapter. I have travelled extensively and always find it terribly inconvenient to pack all of the adapters I might need, some of which have been quite large. This one little adapter (smaller than the palm of my hand) fits them all! It's really easy to use; you just pop the plug you need out, either manually or by releasing the &#34;lock/unlock&#34; slider and when you are done, you pop them back into the place, so it's just a small box without awkward prongs sticking out everywhere. You can tilt the American style prongs to fit several other countries' needs as well. I love that each of the prongs is labeled with some likely countries where it can be used. It also has two USB ports, which is wonderful for most of today's technology. The front prong holes allow for a variety of plugs as well, so you really can go from any plug to any plug! It also comes with easy to understand instructions. This adapter is not a converter, so if your devices are not dual voltage, you will still need to get one of those.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
My son really like this bumper for hos iphone 6. It is light weight we liked the fact that it was easy to put on we didnt struggle not even a little and it protected his phone when he dropped it by accident.

"First of all, a disclosure that I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />There are a few scenarios where I find 10 feet micro usb cables necessary compared to shorter ones. In the bedroom where I want to use my phone while charging it, anything shorter than a 10 footer and I wouldn't be able to lay back comfortably on my bed while connected. That applies in the living room as well, when I'm laying back on the sofa. In addition, in my home office I need to route the cable from the outlet to my table and only a 10 feet cable could do that.<br /><br />My primary concern was that fast charging would be an issue with a 10 feet cord, but this PowerLine cable fast charges my Galaxy S6 with a stock Samsung fast charging charger.<br /><br />Two cable ties were included with this cable and they work really well in that they detach and attach easily. They have a good hold yet it opens without force. Since I don't need to use them for this cable, I am repurposing them on other cables.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the grey color, however. I love the look of Anker's white and black cables (and especially their red nylon braided ones), so I hope they give us that option in the future.<br /><br />Anker touts a 10000+ bend lifespan on these and although I haven't actually bent them 10000 times, I do like how the cable feels different than any other cable I've tried before. It kind of feels like Gumby (if you're old enough to know what that is) in that you can bend them in a certain shape and they kind of stay in that shape. It's rigid, yet malleable at the same time.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fast durable micro usb cable, I have no problems recommending this Anker PowerLine cable backed by Anker's warranty and great customer service.<br /><br />Update: 9/26/15 (Anker PowerLine Micro USB (6ft) Review)<br />I already have the 10 feet grey version of this cable and gave it five stars. I use it in my bedroom to reach from the wall to my tablet and phone in bed. In that review, I wrote of the need for it to work with fast charging, which it does, and how I wasn't a big fan of the grey color. Well, this white six footer still does fast charging and USB transfers quickly but is white and looks a lot better in my opinion. It still has a durable bend quality and that's important because I am using this in the car where I need to constantly adjust its position.<br /><br />This will be my go to for all micro usb cables from now on at 1ft, 6ft, and 10ft.wrote of the need for it to work with fast charging, which it does, and how I wasn't a big fan of the grey color.

"These are great little earphones. They easily paired with my cellphone and with  a wireless transmitter from my TV. They have a great bass sound. My only criticism is that the treble is a little too bright ( it seems to be missing mid-range strength).<br /><br />They are comfortable to wear. Depending on the size of earbud you use, there is some noise generated from my own jaw muscles. That went away with smaller buds. They fit well, and block outside noise well."
Very nice case for my iPod.
The gel case looks stylish. We bought this for a white-colored phone so the color shows thru nice. The design is simple and stylish. Fits the phone nice and solid. Very nice product.
Strong case. Didn't fit my phone perfectly but it looks nice!
"I have bought a lot of these cables for my Apple product, but find they don't work or are flimsy.  I have bought theses because they work overtime and I don't have to hunt for one that will work.  There gold and there easy to find and they work and they are sturdy.  I've bought two so far. One for my car and one for home."
"I purchased this item with a significant discount but most importantly it is the best plug I have purchased to charge the items in my car and I am very pleased with it.  I have purchased several similar plugs at various local drug stores and they seemed to fit correctly and but would become loose and become unusable when driving.  This item was snug and never became loose on any surfaced roads that I traveled.  With regard to the LED lights showing voltage, amps and temperature is nice but more for the geeks and did not matter to me....I am just happy that the item is the best I found to use when needing a USB port when traveling in a car."
"Does exactly what I need it to! I bought it to power to 8ohm JBL speakers. They sound great! (mine came with a power adapter, unlike some other reviews)"
This case does not fit well at all. Does not come up over the edges enough. I do not recommend this case.
"Well, they arrived today. I have purchased better sounding earbuds for $3.00. Not only do they sound bad, only one side works."
Fantastic replacement.  This is my third time fixing my clumsy mistakes and the first screen I bought from a different vendor for more than double the price was total garbage.  The screen had awful light leak and didn't feel like the OEM at all.  I installed this screen myself in under 30 minutes while watching a YouTube teardown video.  Very happy with the quality can't even tell it's not from the factory!
"Decent phone case, but it's just a hair too big for my phone so it slides around. Even though I got it for the g4, it doesn't fit my g4. Probably won't buy again."
I LOVE THIS CASE!<br /><br />Everything is PRO: protection! Looks great - true to color and style.<br />Only con is that the corner bends when dropped just like how a textbook cover dents and bends when you drop it.<br /><br />Overall. Highly recommend!
"Tried this cell phone with two different carriers.  As long as I was in the 1900 tower range, I had coverage.  Once I was in the 850 range, I lost coverage.  I bought this phone for my business cell and was unable to receive half of my calls.  I would not recommend this product unless you know you are within the 1900 tower range.  If you are traveling, you will lose signal once you leave 1900 tower range."
Has problems when I put it on the charger and it randomly shuts off and won't come back on unless I plug it up to the charger.
Great sub's if put in the right size box and good thick ofc power line and ground on the car itself and from batt. to your amp is used. And just make sure all your connections are good. Sub's really hit hard but you should test before you buy or cheak the return just in case becase you never know
"Cowboy Dan ,Says get you one of these it,s all i need for my 97 grand cherokee.If you have an infinity stereo, here,s how just go blue to blue/white and your done! Get the correct wireing kit#1817. Dont worry the remote wire is the one to use,remote still works.Hope this helps! 1 800 Dont bother"
Fits perfect. Didn't have any issues lining it up. O thought it was the same silver as the iphone but no it doesn't match the stock gray-silver
Works fine on my Note 4.
Bought these as a gift for husband and he LOVES them! Great range when working out at the gym and he said they are very comfortable!
"Functionally, these worked well, but the flimsy construction makes them easily damaged.  After falling from my ear to the surface of a table (less than a 3 foot drop) one of the buds came apart, leaving the ear piece dangling from very thin wires.  I was able to press the pieces back together, and it still worked.  On another occasion, I snagged the cord on an obstacle, and the wire on the earbud broke at the volume control before it even pulled out of my ear.<br /><br />I don't expect them to last forever, but I do expect more than a couple weeks of use from these."
"I absolutely love this case!  The next isn't a con regarding the case but something you should be aware of,  A standard one ring wireless charger will not work with this case .  You will need to purchase a three ring wireless charger"
Good phone used with Tracfone. Works great in my area.  Need to shut off bluetooth and wifi when not in use to save battery.  Battery needs daily or more frequent charging.
I really like this screen protector.  It was very easy to place on the phone and even lifted off and resealed nicely when I placed it a little crooked the first time.  The true test is to see how it hold up when the phone is dropped though!  The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars was because there was a little fleck of something on the protector when I pulled it off the backing and I can see it on my phone.
"If you are currently browsing for a screen protector, look no further. It adheres to your phone's screen quickly and with no bubbles. Also, once applied the screen looks and responds like there was no protector at all. Great product!"
"This is a replacement after the connector between the holster and the clip broken after getting into my car. I didn't request credit toward the replacement, but will reserve judgment until later on. I love the overall unit, except I'm wondering if the durability is there for the long term."
"Cheap. It is some kind of HD dimension, but not quality. Great value for price. Bought two. One for front and back."
Poor connectivity
Great product
Apparently it works well because I have trouble getting my 14yr old daughter to stop drawing and leave her room.lol<br />I am greatful to go digital because with all the art work she creates I was getting nervous about all the papers becoming a fire hazard.<br />JaneB
"Noise cancelling, powerful, sounds very clear even for heavy metal. These are the best at a good price."
"Just an amazing product. Would have loved if the packing had any box for keeping earphones. Apart from that, product is brilliant for such an amazing price.<br /><br />Works perfectly with iPhone, iPad, Mac.<br /><br />The volume buttons  play pause, forward backward - all buttons work exactly same as EarPods.<br /><br />TLDR:<br />Buy this product: Best Price"
Worked for a few minutes and all of the sudden stopped working but the packaging was good and the installation went ok except for the fact that it stopped working
"I  am kind of disappointed with the color on this phone case, not even close to how it looks on the picture, everything else is good."
"I usually go through 3 or 4 different cases for my iPhones before settling on one I like. The design of the iPhone 6 is so spectacular that I was hesitant to cover it up, but after having tried just one other case, this is the one I'm going to stick with. It hardly adds any bulk to the phone, the clear back shows off the Apple logo, and the black bumper sides blend in perfectly with the black front of the space grey phone and also provide a soft grip and just enough raised edge to protect the screen if you lay it face down. One of the best features is the button covers - they don't protrude at all from the sides of the case but are still easy to find with your fingers. Excellent value for a good price.  * I received this this product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.*"
"This is a pretty Nifty Gadget,  Loved it from the get-go!  Still about 3 weeks of having it,  and I believe I've found the best Bluetooth FM Transmitter.  I live in a Big City with many radio stations with high frequency signals and it has been superior to a Wired FM Transmitter from Monster that i've previously owned.  Even Though I am happy with this device it does have  minor flaws.  Here are the Cons and Pros of it.  Pros:  1.  Sleek cool style (Gotta love the magnetic top piece sticking onto the bottom piece)   2.  Sound Quality is as good as you'll get with bluetooth ( Living in a big city found it to be less static than most wired transmitters)   3.  The Illuminated Blue USB Charging port works great with my 5.2 inch Smart Phone   4.  If you enjoy Online streaming media Radio such as Pandora, Spotify or Google play and perhaps others   you'll find the NEXT and PREVIOUS tactile Buttons very handy as well as the Pause and Play Big Button on top   But my Favorite is the VOLUME Button on the top of the device. (Comes very handy when your Vehicle has the   a power outlet infront of the armrest console for those with SUV's)   5.  The Price is reasonable,  you sure get what you pay for.  If you have two vehicles you can just transfer the top piece   from vehicle to vehicle and having a spare for just in case.  Cons:  1.  Had a few Bluetooth skips,  (not connection but actually blutooth signal delays)  but for the most part it works like a charm   2.  The microphone was one BIG let down,  as I tried to talk through it using the phone but everyone found to listen to me when   in use.  Perhaps is the location where the power outlet is, but power outlets don't come standar near the sunvisor or any car that   I'm aware of,  perhaps that makes the call audio out hard to figure out.   3.  The Design is not quite well fitted for most cars,  the USB charger part is pretty long and the top piece is heave as it is Magnetic   Which can cause minor pressure on the power outlet.GOOD part about it is that the rod that the magnetic transmitter sits is very   Bendable."
these things will pound with enough power.caution these are no joke.with 2 4000 watt ssl monoblock d amps bridged it is causing my front windshield to flex a half and inch. installed in a 2000 chevy metro hatchback
"The case is a lower cost alternative to the similar Otterbox case with an added bonus of interchangeable backplates. 3 part construction will provide good protection against the drops, etc. but I do not buy the &quot;waterproof&quot; feature. Also the flaps are a bit inconvenient to deal with if you need to access covered controls and ports. Hence the 4 stars."
this product was provided for a honest unbiased review.<br /><br />[packing]<br />this product came in a little package i was kinda disappointed on how there was not more protective packing because when the headphones arrived. but still it came the headphones were not damaged but the packing was and i think the company should worry about that because of the headphones got damaged that would be bad.<br /><br />[sturdy]<br />they use a very strong material for the backing of the headphones and there is a big square button that is really nice push. i did a test drop on them they got a little scuffed up but they overall did very well. its has a very nice look it  and still being very tough.<br /><br />[design]<br />the earbuds look really good i like how there square shaped. the front of the right earbud has a square button which feels really nice to the touch. there is a little button on the back which lights i would rather it have been put on the front. The cord is really nice and feels good around my neck<br /><br />[sound]<br />This headphones set has really good sound nothingness crazy but for the peace it's really nice it has good bass and he highs and mids are very nice overall the sound quality is very good<br /><br />[bluetooth]<br />I had no problem connecting my iphone6 to the Bluetooth headset . I did not have any trouble with it braking up or cracking when I went a little bit away from my phone.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent pair of headphones and I will say go for it if you would like to buy them there a very good pair of headphones.<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to contact me!<br /><br />Once again this prudent was provided for a honest unbiased review<br /><br />-Hunter
Worst headphones ever. Only one run and headphones don't work anymore. They won't charge or power.
"works great, I use it for work, bluetooth telephone headset, EXCELLENT QUALITY"
It didn't settle correctly on my phone and I called customer service who were great BTW !!!  I got a replacement within 2 days. No scratches thus far and the second one went on like a charm. New lifetime customer here skinomi.  Thank you
Love this item.  Fits comfy in my ears & I can hear very clear. It doesn't come out while running.  I would def recommend this product.
Solid lightweight case. Have dropped it a few a times and nothing has happened
"Works well when it turns on. Sometimes it won't turn on and I have to plug them in, then it'll turn on immediately. The fit isn't great for me either. But for the price I can't complain."
Pretty good amplifier. Ratings are over rated. They will blow the 15&#34; boss 2500 max easily. Got some 15&#34; kickers now wired at 4ohm they hit hard.
I bought this case about a month ago when the Zazzle brand I got prior to that was cheap looking and tacky. This one is great! It fits my phone really snug and it has the right amount of bling. I get tons of compliments for this case. I simply love it!
"The product is cheap that's my issue, it doesn't feel like it was worth the money and the case won't even close with more than one card inside :/"
This Easylife iphone 5c Waterproof case is great!!!  this phone lives up to my expectations and beyond.  I love that it is waterproof and has covers over the jacks so everything is covered and protected.  it comes with a headphone extender that screws into the phonecase to keep it waterproof while using the headphones.  see pictures.  I really like that it has a spot to put a hand strap and that it came with it.  This case is great!!!  I did receive this case at a discounted rate for my honest opinion.
Nice case but the cutout at the bottom for the power cord is not cut right and you have to remove from case to charge...in my old case (which was similar to this) you could charge the phone without removing it.
"Great product, reasonable price. Provides protection for corners and screen of my wife's I6. Fast ship. Hot pink for my wife being a cancer survivor."
This is a pretty basic case but good quality.  It has the rubber rim around it to protect when it's dropped and the hard middle part to grip the phone easy.  It has a clear protectant glass screen cover that comes with it and the instructions. I received this product at a discount for my review.
Does charge well overnight.  It's definitely a trickle charger.  It IS very nice to just plop my phone down in the evening and forget about it.  The charger automatically turns off when charging is complete.
"I've been purchasing Anker products for several years now, and they have never let me down.  I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this Micro USB cable, however, because I wasn't sure if it was worth the extra premium.  So far I have to say, the answer is yes.<br /><br />I'm reviewing the 3ft version of the cable, which is apparently made partly of Kevlar and is much more stronger than the typical USB cable.  Only time will tell, but based on the way it feels, it certainly is sturdy, and the connectors are as secure as can be.<br /><br />I moved it to my car this morning, as I have the Anker 24W PowerDrive 2 Car Charger.  I use Waze (a GPS smart phone app) on my Samsung Galaxy S4 for traffic information while I am commuting to and from the office, which obviously uses a decent amount of the battery life while running with the screen on.<br /><br />This cable coupled with the USB car charger not only maintains the current level under load but is able to charge my phone to a higher percentage.  Ultimately a primary function of this cable is in its durability, and since I will be plugging and unplugging my phone from it more than once a day, it should last indefinitely.  If you're looking for a quality Micro USB cable for your phone, this is the one to get.<br /><br />As a side note, you may want to consider getting the 6 ft cable depending on your needs.<br /><br />Thanks Anker for another 5-star product!"
Its not that good of product and it only works with the newer phone and if you had Bluetooth on your phone then get the Bluetooth one.
This works wonderfully.  Unnoticeable lag unless you are specifically looking for it
"It was everything they said rugged, lightweight, durable and you can't even feel the plastic screen but you know it's protected buy one."
"Love the look and function of the case (clip rotates--easy to clip to waistband) and the ability to use the &#34;kickstand&#34; and have the glass protected when not in use BUT this is the THIRD i-Blason case that I have bought since October 2014  (less than 10 months)--Oct  2014, May 2015, and now August.  On the first case, it was the side of the cover that broke.  This time it was the side of the phone holder that broke.  I hope this one lasts longer than 3-4 months."
Saved me a bucket of money.. Works just fine...
"I rarely ever write reviews but I felt like this was necessary because of how amazing this case is. If you are a klutz who drops her phone everyday then this case is perfect for you! I don't know how many times I've dropped my phone, even with the screen down and still have a perfect screen. It's not bulky and fits well!"
"Great cell phone case. Upon first glance this case looked very sturdy. It was easy to put on my phone and clung well around the phone. The buttons work and line up well. The case is very form fitting.  There is a credit card slot on the back of the case. I can quickly slip my credit card and id in the slot and go about my day. I don't have to worry about losing the cards because I always take my phone with me wherever I go. The credit cards stay put and do not slip out.  Since I have been using this case I have received several compliments. It almost feels like I have bought a new phone. Instead, it is all because of the cell phone case.  Disclaimer: I was provided a discounted or free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. Regardless, all of my opinions are 100% my own and were gained through my own experiences with this product."
Love this case ...protects your phone and you can still see your phone ...it's not all blocked by a bulky case .
Fits great works great and looks great. The best thing it tells you that its a 4g unlike all of them on here.
I got the gold glitter case. My buttons are all protected. It fits my phone perfectly. The camera part is actually protect because the back does stick out farther than my camera. It's even more gorgeous in person! I won't be worried about good looks and protection with this case. It's perfect.
"Quick summary: If you're purchasing because you've heard the hype about the Tripath chips, this is not the one you want - you will be disappointed.  If you're just looking for a cheap, low power, energy efficient amplifier with the FM tuner and memory card / usb capabilities, you MIGHT be satisfied, but I don't recommend this first of all due to the serious noise issues, and unsatisfying FM performance.  Some noise comes from the display (read below for details), but even after removing that there is still too much noise for me.<br /><br />Original Review (Approx 9/2/2015):<br />Original Title: &#34;Hum/buzzing sound - no good if you will be close to speakers&#34;<br />First of all, I am using these connected to a computer, and therefore use them for computer speakers on my desk (about 3 feet from my ears), as well as for movies (I reposition them around my TV for that).  Being that I am so close to them, the hum noise is totally unacceptable for me.  Note that before purchasing, I read several reviews mentioning the buzzing/humming sound when nothing was playing. I was concerned about this, but decided to take a chance and get it anyway... and I just received it today. It does in fact have the hum in Aux and FM modes (I have not tried the MP3/USB function yet). It's definitely noticeable, and I find it annoying. It is present even when the volume dial is all the way down. There are actually two components to the noise... one is a hum/buzz (approximately 200 hz), and one is just static. The hum/buzz strangely goes away when I turn the volume dial to maximum, but the static is always present. I also own an Onkyo TX-SR601 7.1 Ch receiver, and a hybrid tube amp.  Both are much more expensive than this, but I never noticed any hum with them [edit: I double checked the hybrid amp and actually there is a little hum but only noticeable if I put my ear within about 6 inches of the speaker... it's much lower and doesn't bother me]. The only troubleshooting I have done so far is to put it on two different power strips, but the result is the same either way. On one of the power strips this was the only component on it.  I'm wondering if the similar looking (but slightly more expensive, and using a different amp chip) [[ASIN:B00L8PJDBS Lepy LP-600 Hi-Fi Mini Audio 25W*2 Amplifier with USB SD MP3 and Power adapter]] has the same issue.  I asked the question to those owners...<br /><br />A note about my setup: I tested these using the satellite speakers from a polk audio RM6750 5.1 surround system (originally purchased around 2007).  The Polks are fairly sensitive 8 ohm speakers at 89 db.<br /><br />Update one day later: I happened to find a review for the similar Lepai LP-269FS, that mentioned the buzzing sound was fixed by de-soldering the display.  Actually there were many reviews for that model that mentioned the hum came from the display.  I figured it might be the same issue on this model; however, I didn't feel like breaking out the soldering iron, so I just took some diagonal cutters and needle nose pliers and destructively removed it (just remove the front panel 4 screws to get to it).  Well, now the really annoying loud hum is gone, but the less annoying snow noise is still there... and I'm flying blind (but I'm only planning to use AUX and FM modes anyway, so that's not so bad).  If I didn't want the FM, I would definitely go with the LP-2020A+, though.  I'm kind of wanting to try that one anyway, just for comparison of the sound.... although now I'm looking at purchasing the much more expensive AudioEngine N22 instead.<br /><br />Note: Interestingly, I noticed there is another Lepai/Lepy model similar to this, but it doesn't have the display [[ASIN:B00721Z1AE Lepai LP-A68 Digital 2 x 15W Amplifier with Remote/USB/MP3/SD/FM]].  So it seems that functionally the LP-V9S without the display is similar to the LP-A68... although that has room for larger dials, and it has less wattage.<br /><br />Update 9/27/15 (about 25 days later): Ipurchased a Topping TP-20 MKII amp used, and it is much quieter than the LP-V9S after display removal.  If I put my ear up to the Polk speakers, I can hear some &#34;snow&#34;/static using the Topping, but it's totally acceptable (I believe on par with my hyrbid tube amp).  Moving my ear away from the speaker, the static becomes inaudible at about 7&#34; away.  Switching to the Lepy LP-V9S, the static is louder, and doesn't become inaudible until my ear is about 20~25&#34; away from the Polk's tweeter.  Overall, I just don't have any confidence in the Lepy, and I think it's going to end up sitting in a corner for a while.  The FM also sounded flat to me.  The FM from my Onkyo TX-SR601 receiver is the best sounding FM that I have, but that thing is just too big and creates too much heat.  I purchased an old (1987) Onkyo tuner T-4120 secondhand as a smaller option to use with the Topping, but this is not a particularly easy solution.  As-is the T-4120 sounds much better (dynamic range / resolution?), but it is super noisy - I believe due to the wide filters they put in back them.  I know I need to at least change the 10.7MHZ filters out to 180khz, and it might need an alignment... so I'm not necessarily advocating going the old route [edit: tried changing the filters to 180khz, but still have the noise].  Check out the &#34;FM Tuner Info&#34; site if you're interested.  Regarding the topping, I have seen a few recommendations to power it from a Sealed Lead Acid battery, so I tried it and it does sound spectacular to these Audiophile wannabe ears... I think it does indeed sound the best that way, although I didn't do a lot of A-B comparisons to absolutely know it's not my mind just messing with me.  I also tried powering the Lepy from the battery, but it didn't reduce the noise so I didn't go any further.  By the way, I never did try the Audioengine N22... I think the Topping powered from the SLA battery does the job for me.  Reducing my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars, because I'm fairly certain now that the Lepy is not going to get much use from me.eter than the LP-V9S after display removal.

"The sound is fantastic, and the bluetooth range is exceptional. Would not hestitate to purchase again,"
"Ive got this yesterday and im actually using it right now.  The case is very light, not bulky and no compartments at all. Its kinda slippery at the back but then you get used to. What i love this case is every edges is covered and it looks safe, I got this to exchange discounted honesty this is so far one of my fave phone case. I would highly recommend this."
"Like the case and stylish design, although I wish it stayed in the propped position when placed there. Falls quite easily. Otherwise in satisfied."
I don't care much about the protection part of the case. I hate that it slides off the counter when a car backfires outside. This case isn't quite as grippy as I thought or hoped it might be. But that makes it easier to slide in and out of jean pockets. But it is going to be fine as far as having enough grip to not slide around off my truck center console etc. It's doesn't make the phone that much larger either and I like that. Happy with this item.
It's supposed to have 3 lenses and I only got 2 please send me the wide angel. Thank you
"I just bought this because it was on sale for $8.99 and I have no regrets!<br />I was never really in the market for a selfie-stick but for the price + the bluetooth functionality I couldn't resist. You never know when it could come in handy. One tip, if you are looking for a selfie stick, make sure it has bluetooth functionality so you can snap the photo from the handle, some of the asian knock off versions have a pretty ghetto physical switch to tap the phone screen with a knob.<br /><br />see the photos taken for the unboxing and usage-<br />the quality feels pretty durable, the metal rods feel solid in hand and are not bendable without excessive force. as long as you dont go chucking this at the wall, this should last you a long time.<br />the internal battery is only 60mah but the inserted pamphlet does say it can operate for 20 hours on a single charge...<br />it charges by any 5V micro usb that your smart phone or other devices commonly use.<br /><br />yep 5 stars, no regrets, solid construction, folds away easily when not in use, great price at 8.99"
"Amazing product, buy it! I've been using this products for months now and it works! It is very durable & long (6ft). It charges the phone quickly too. My sister would steal this cord and use it to charge her own phone if I am not charging mine. I would recommend!"
"Some cases are a lot of trouble getting the phone into and out of, so this one wins on that count.  I don't like a lot of cases because they are too bulky or too heavy or cumbersome to carry.  I like this one.  Good protection for the weight and price.  The cutouts are better than on many other models I've tried, nice and clean.  Recommended."
"Works great. Was able set it up with minimal confusion. I just cancelled my Onstar subscription so with the money I'm saving I decided on the Garmin. I am going to loan it to my son for his next road trip, so it's nice to be able to share it. The screen is easier to see, and gives more info than Onstar for a fraction of the price. Happy with purchase."
"With case the buttons don't work as well and some times when I pull it out of my back pocket the case pulls apart. Also not all of chargers will fit with out taking the case off ,which is a pain . I love the color."
"I feel like the phone is well protected! It's somewhat bulky but that's not a bad trade-off for the good protection. The way it curves in on the sides makes it comfortable to hold with my arthritic fingers, and I am pleased with the blue color. Gave it 4 stars because of the bullies - but, I can live with that considering the good protection. If possible I would have rated 4.5."
I saved myself a decent amount of money following the youtube video the process was very simple. My camera works like new for a fraction of the insurance fee.
"God I wish I read more reviews before purchasing this complete POS!! I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS COMING FROM JAPAN!!  I had to wait almost a month to get it shipped to me. Once I opened it up, it looked just like my Samsung so I was happy...until I charged it up and tried to use it to send a text. NO matter how hard or light I pressed letters or digits, it did not work. The period is right by the backspace and &#34;DONE&#34; feature so every time I tried to hit the PERIOD for 'DOT COM&#34; it backspaced me and deleted what I had already written...it was so frustrating. I was trying to send an important picture to my boss from the fair I was working at...total and complete piece of poop...had i Known It was coming from so far away I would not have purchased it because now I have to pay for the postage to Japan and it is going to cost me more than the freaking phone did. From now on, no knock offs for me. If it isn't Samsung I don't want it. so dissappointed..seller...you need to do some work on your customer service and your cheesy cheap products or your ratings in here will plummet!"
Don't seem any better than stock battery
Cheap but yet effective case for the money my daughter loves it
Fabulous.  Have had many compliments. Fits perfectly.
"This screen protector fits my LG G2 perfectly. It was easy to install and held up quite well despite my phone case rubbing on the edges and causing it to lift a little. It has been on my phone for the last 2 months and held up to toddlers and various drops. Just yesterday, I dropped the phone on a tile floor and the screen protector finally cracked. I'm so glad it was the protector and not the screen itself! I replaced it with the standard transparency film to see if it was more compatible with my case, but since the case is doing the same thing to the new screen protector I'll order another tempered glass one and replace my case."
Perfect for my wife new phone. Love Otterbox. If you have a problem they will make good on their product for life.
I ordered this case for my daughter and she loves it!! Thank you very much Amazon!!
"This kit did the job. I was worried due to previous comments about receiving the glass already broken but mine was perfect, not a scratch. The only problem I had was that the picks were too thick and the adhesive lining was squished in the box which made it hard to stick to the phone smoothly...although after 15 minutes I finally got it on there perfectly. took a lot of patience but all turned out well so im not going to knock a star just for 2 tiny problems...also this price cant be beat! 5 stars!"
Great product very good instructions and applies perfectly when you follow them.
"This is a great case. The plastic screen protector was a little loose when I first put it on, but after a week it stopped clicking and it seems to be flush against the screen. It's not quite as responsive as my iPhone 4 and Otterbox were, but that's only ever a problem with some games, not with any important phone functions. And I've never had any problems with the touch ID through the button cover."
Good product!  Works well / cheap and shipped reasonably fast...
Does not work on my iPhone<br />Don't by this product  worked for one week and went dead. Not good fit glass lifted up in 3 days.
Perfect charger... I used it for the first time while on a camping trip... It charged my phone come early while I was watching videos :)
Fully great charges my samsung galazy tablet & phone .
The case is a perfect fit and it looks great. It is way better then an otter box and you can't  beat the price. Thanks for a great product.
"Got this item free to try/review and exceeds my expectation. I like that there are two different lights and coincidentally are Seahawks colors! :)<br />My BF and I always run into this issue where we fight over the one spot to charge our phones (iPhone vs Android). In addition to the attached cord, there are 2 other USB ports! we are planning to purchase another one for his car!"
This product would have to be one of the bwst ones i have purchased. It's good quality and actually protects the device. It has good stitching and the fabric is also great quality. My daughter is rough on things and so far this item seems to be holding up. Oh amd the seems are perfect too. Not like the cheaps one that buckle everytime you open it. I would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br /> I was given this product for a discount for my unbiased and honest review
"Awesome case, just as described and fits perfect. Delivery was fast and it is so much nicer than my Ballistic case."
"The plastic part around the magnet (which is supposed to close the flap part) broke 1 week after. The metallic part of the magnet came off after 10 days, which means that the case does not close at all. Quite disappointed with this product."
Love having  extra  chargers instead of  moving  one around to were need it.
Nice stand.  Place right on nightstand for convenience.
"love the way it feels and simplifies my purse. It is too bulky for a pocket and the strings swing in the way of the camera, but they are easy enough to remove. Really lovely product."
"I loved this case. I had it on my galaxy s3 for two years, I dropped my phone weekly, and never got a scratch on my phone. I highly recommend this case."
"The build quality of this thing is solid (made in japan). It works great and does charge reliably. That being said, the capacity is low as it only takes 2 eneloop batteries. I wish they made this thing take like 6 batteries (that would take a week to charge in sunlight). I ordered  the eneloop pro batteries with this device to ensure higher capacity, which hold up to 2550 Mah. Of course the device takes 15 hours to recharge the batteries from pure sunlight, so this is more of an emergency device you leave in your window (only charges in direct sunlight). Stay tuned I plan to run my cellphone down and recharge with the pro-eneloops to see how much I can squeeze out of it. (testing on iphone 6). Okay did a test today, was able to charge the iphone 6  39% - 85% so that's 46% and that's probably the best case scenario, realistically I'd say you are looking at about 30% on your phone."
Arrived on time. Sturdy case.  It would have been convenient to have a wrist strap attached to it.  I am however pleased with the purchase.
Love this case.  Very durable and protects my phone when dropped accidentally on tile floors.  Stylish and holds my credit cards so only need to take with me shopping is phone and cards while out.
"The quality was not what I expected. This headphone does not have a clear sound system, so it is hard to carry on a conversation."
"Ours may have been a defective model but when the case is fully on the tablet, lining up the rubber notches to the tablet, the rubber buttons on the volume are too tight to the tablet and the buttons are then pressed continuously. We have found that we can just not push the case all the way in at that spot but then the rubber isn't fully enclosing the entire tablet. So it works but not the way it is supposed to.<br /><br />Otherwise the case is really great ! Sturdy and a nice feel in the hands"
LCD is a  very good  quality and excellent color contrast..happy with this purchase
Very handy little connectors. Feel kind of cheap but so far have held up. At this price they have been a great deal. They seem to charge the various electronics very quickly and well. Performing just as we had hoped and with the retract feature make for a good travel cord.
The armband case is perfect except for the strap. Once you start loosing weight around your arms the Velcro can only go so small before it doesn't fit snug. It would be nice if it had a adjustable strap for large -small arms. I would buy from this company again in the future 
"This did not work for my brand new 1080 Toshiba flat screen, I followed all the directions and nothing ."
Perfect.  Sturdy and u can see through it.
Cheap cheap cheap. They fell apart before I could even try them on. The wire came out of the ear piece just removing it from the packaging.
This product is a piece of junk. I brought this tablet for my daughters birthday once opened the charger didn't work. My daughter dropped this tablet once and wont even turn on had it less then 30 day.Customer service was great with returning money
Great phone and had no problems with it or seller.
Does everything it says...very worth the price. Great if your a Bost Owner !
"Fast,  efficient,  good price.  Homerun!"
"Good alternative to the wireless charging stickers, especially for the price. Easy to install, both the quick circle interface and the wireless charging started to work as soon as I snapped in the replacement back panel, nothing to configure. The case has a nice texture to it, giving you a pretty decent grip. Appears to be a legit LG product.<br />I do wish the magnet for the wireless charger was a bit stronger; It can be a pain aligning the phone just right with the powermat. Additionally, I would have liked to have a bit more drop protection, as the new back plate is shaped differently and precludes the use of any standard G3 case.<br />Overall a good product for an outstanding price. With this and an old Duracell powermat I was able to buy a wireless charging set up for just a little over $20."
great styolus & I like that it fits in the earphone hole on my iphone so it doesn't get lost.
"JDB 10000mAh Power Bank is a perfect solution for those who travels a lot and often not around a AC wall jack or charging stations. Even if you have access to the AC power jack, sometime you don't feel like carrying those AC adapters or waiting near the AC power jack wall for the phone to fully charge. This JDB battery pack charges my iPhone 3 times. This battery pack have two USB output so you can charge two devices at the same time (one is 1A and the other one is 2.1A. I do wish both are 2.1A for faster charging). It also has LED light which is not super bright but nice to have. I notice that it seems to take forever to charge and for a while I thought this battery pack is broken (as it stays hours after hours only showing one bar with second bard blinking and once it moves to the third bar it seems to charge faster to complete the charge to full so if you see it seems to get stuck at charging on the second bar try to be patient and keep charging it for more hours). Thanks JDB for sending this sample product."
Great product!
"Don't waste your money. Had it on my iPhone 6 since May, shattered underneath the protector by the end of August. Huge disappointment."
"Greatest warranties ever - Have had 17 of them, made 5 claims (3 tablets, an all-in-one printer, and headphones) - all paid/repaired immediately/super fast!  Amazon has the best prices on these babies.  They are pure gold!"
I bought this after a lot of research. It works well. The included charger is sturdy and high quality.
These Subs are amazing. I'm running them in a prefab box with 500w and they still slam.
"Everything works on this watch. The graphics on the display aren't bright like other watches I have seen. The battery lasts me about 2 1/2 days when paired with my phone, but would be better if I turned off email notifications."
"Bought this unit for a trip to the Carribeans on a Carnival cruise ship.  Performance was perfect for their intent.<br />Communication was almost flawless from the front of the ship to the aft of the ship and every where in between. There was some dead spots but both parties stayed in communication with each others.<br />Used on an excursion couple miles off shore, and performance was amazing with the group on shore.<br />Very pleased with this purchase. Thanks Amazon."
Can a product be rated a &#34;zero&#34; stars???  These cables CANNOT be Apple certified.  They do not charge the iPhone 6 or iPad.  False advertising & a big waste of money....
I purchased 2 armbands and both ripped in the same spot!  They must have lasted about a whole month!
"I ordered this because it said screen protector... When it arrived in the mail it was an actual glass screen for the iPhone, which is nice, except I didn't need a new screen.  Btw I ordered it based on the recommendation of a friend who ordered the same exact product and he got a screen protector, I got a screen"
"The Garmin Edge 500 is a fantastic product. I've been riding road bicycles for many years, and thought my CatEye bike computers were plenty. So I was hesitant to purchase, but have been happy ever since.<br />The main benefits of this computer are;<br />--Dedicated unit with long battery life: It does one thing very well -- track and display speed and distance.<br />--Small and lightweight: Critical for roadies!<br />--Easy to setup (although reading direction is required!)<br />--Excellent low light visibility: I ride early in the morning and 8 months of the year it's dark when I start.<br />--Syncs with Strava and RidewithGPS<br />--Requires no data plan: This is important for logging rides in Canada. We visit often and my phone would use many $$ of data tracking a ride. This unit doesn't require that so I can log every ride and upload when we return.<br />--Solid HRM: The only time I see weird readings is when the battery is about to go. The deluxe strap is comfortable and long-lasting (just hand wash it and let it air dry).<br /><br />Although once every 3 months or so there will be a Garmin error, eventually it gets sorted out and the ride is logged.<br /><br />I don't rely on this unit for directions, altitude, or ambient temperature. Those features are present but not trustworthy. Who cares? There's a hill? Climb it. When you're finished, load the file and see exact elevation online.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the Garmin-provided mount. I immediately purchased the wildly expensive K-Edge mount and have been happy. I use the Garmin mount on my rain bike and it slides, moves, and just feel insecure.<br /><br />Overall a great unit for road cyclists riding on familiar roads. I would upgrade to a map version if I was riding tours or cross country."
The price was outstanding but I wish it held the charge longer. I don't use my phone much but when I need it I need the battery to be charged.
It provides protection for the phone when carried in a cargo pocket and is thin enough to be carried in a leather case attached to a belt of waistband.
"The cell batteries were fine for a while, but are now very weak. Purchased in February, they are advertised with a 12 month warranty, but try to return them and Amazon says the window to return or exchange closed in March. I would like them to honor the 12 month warranty by replacing tthe batteries."
"The keyboard frequently can't keep up with the speed I am typing... so it causes a lot of typos... Additionally it frequently types numerous letters of the same type so that instead of typing one word you get onnnnne worrrrdd.. even though you only hit the key once.... which means you have to go back and correct it as well.<br />The case is of good quality, but the flap gets in the way while you are using it since it comes out the front. There is no way to secure it in some other position so that it isn't sticking out at your torso while using the tablet in the open position.<br />I do like that the keyboard is magnetic and comes apart from the case so that you can charge it separately or so that you can use the tablet without the keyboard weight or pressing the keys because you are holding the tablet like a book. However, I will likely have to find another solution because of the mechanical difficulties. (I did not write this review on the keyboard.)"
"The fit into the holster is very tight and difficult to remove in a hurry.  However, removing the black rib makes it better.  The holster can even work with other covers"
"I have been using this in my car for several months, it has never fallen off the window. Holds the phone good. My only (minimal) complaint is that it vibrates a lot."
In the description it clearly states the frequency range starts at 87.5 and in actuality it starts at 88.1 which is pointless for anyone who lives in or near any top 50 city in the US as the only good frequencies for FM Transmitters are under 88.1
Got it quick. Product works/fits perfect. good buy for the price.
Came earlier than expected. Cord seems to be better quality than others of the same price.
Fits well and looks great.  No problem putting it on my Vision 2
I never drop my phones first time in 10 years.  I just droped the S6 with this case 20 feet to a steel deck.  I obviously expected the worse because i didnt pay 70$ for the otter box.  The case has a couple scratches thats it the phone looks and operates flawlessly!!!!  Best case ever!!!!
Very disappointed.  There are marks and scuffs along the side and back.  Appear to be a bad mold or something.  I will be returning.
Like the XL size because I don't have to take the case off of my 6 XL I phone.
"The size guide had me clearly in the &#34;large zone&#34; but the large unit was also clearly too big for my wrist.  I have traded this in for the Medium, which has arrived and fits great... So the two stars in this review relate to the purchasing experience not the actual device... I will post my review of the actual device (after I've used it for awhile) with my purchased medium size unit"
This holder does a great job of keeping your phone in view. The mount has two different sizes for thin or thicker vent fins. Pops on and off very easily but is secure. Comes with 3 different magnets to either attach to your phone/case or place on between the phone and case. I have not noticed any issues from using the magnet on my galaxy note 4. I find that if I hit a significant bump in the car it will occasionally fall off. This doesn't happen often enough (a few times in a few months) for me to negate a star. Definitely a good product.
"Fits perfectly, looks really good on the iPhone. What I really like is that the bottom of the case doesn't make it harder to access the Lightning port which my previous apple case did."
Awesome product.  Camera and monitor worked great.  Installation all depends on your vehicle and how you want it to operate.  Mine I hooked up to the reverse light directly.  I have a van and the wire was sufficient to install and hide the wire but I had to put the monitor on the left side which worked better because it wouldn't fit well in the center.  I don't want it to stand out.<br />It's a must have.  The colors are a bit funky.  Tint is off but who cares.  Has the option to attach a second input too.<br />Camera tilts.  It is the plastic type not the metal.  Still works.  At night it has great visibility especially due to your reverse lights.  I want to install one in the front of the car as parking is difficult for our van as we can't see the front.
"The case is pretty,  but the back started peeling off the  third week."
Cheap it has  scratches and doesn't fit my defender case for my Samsung S5 also shipping took a month
"These things are a MUST HAVE for anyone who owns a Fitbit Charge!  I lost my first Fitbit because the clasp just comes undone too easily. But ever since I've used these, I haven't had to even think about my Fitbit randomly coming unclasped and falling off. They are fun to change out the colors every so often, but I mostly just stick with the black color, since it matches my Fitbit. Don't even hesitate, you NEED these if you have a Fitbit Charge!"
Prompt delivery. Excellent product.
Met my expectations.  Does not add a lot of bulk to the phone and the stand works as expected.
I had to return it. The audio jack extender  was not great. One of the case covers was an imperfect fit. I would have to press the button to lock the screen twice to lock it.
Purchased 4 of these and 3 of 4 stopped working after less than 2 months.  Ugh!!!
works as intended
No regrets. This helps my phone very well & nobody cannot see what i am doing on my phone but myself. Get this item
"This review is for the Galaxy Note Edge Screen Protector. [Edge Not Covered] Skque® Privacy Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Note Edge<br /><br />I must say that this will be my first screen protector since purchasing my Galaxy Note Edge.<br /><br />I had no problem with installation of this product .<br />There are tabs that tell you which side to peel, which side to install first ect...<br /><br />I peeled number 1 tab off halfway, was careful to apply making sure to get the function holes correctly placed,  and proceeded to smooth out the remaining of the protector onto my screen.<br /><br />I checked to make sure no bubbles were there , and smoothed out a couple with a credit card.<br /><br />I then peeled off the number 2 tab leaving my phone supposedly covered.<br /><br />Now this is what i noticed :<br /><br />The screen since being a privacy screen is dark (similar to sunglasses) and a couple of bubbles were remaining that i couldn't see before peeling the last layer.  I would suggest carefully and closely inspecting before peeling of the last layer since they were barely visible.<br /><br />I also noticed that even though i correctly positioned the protector, and my buttons were  showing correctly through the cut outs, that the left edge was not fully covered.<br />I don't mean the curved edge, i mean the flat edge.<br />With the screen protector being darker, it was a little bit obvious that it wasn't fully covered and i felt that it made it unpleasing to the eye.<br /><br />The edge also seemed very square, and not at all rounded, making it a little weird for me to flip left and right through the edge functions.<br /><br />Another thing i noticed, that hadn't occurred to me while purchasing , since this is a privacy screen, is that the edge is so bright it almost looks too bright compared to the rest of the screen.  I felt it was glaringly bright.<br /><br />The screen protector did feel thick and i do think it would give some good protection for your phone if you don't mind these flaws.<br /><br />I used a double layer Reiko Case, i don't know if another case might cover your edge more and make this screen protector edges less obvious, but for myself this protector is not practical and i will be removing it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. However I don't just give glowing reviews to a product just because i received it free or a discount.

"This is pretty cool...I love the concept, but after having my little wallet for a couple months now I have noticed a little of the blue parts flecking off and the magnetic clasp has weakened and does not hold the wallet shut anymore. Aside from that, the color is true to the picture and I have gotten many compliments on it!"
"Received my phone case two weeks prior to the delivery date! Extremely happy with the quick delivery, the packaging, and the amazing quality! Deserves 5 stars! Will recommend!"
"I got this case with the one shown above. The review is technically the same. Love the feel of it as well as the vibrant colors. Very convenient as it holds credit card, ID and of course the phone. No need for a purse. Received this item in exchange for a review."
"I received this power case 3 days ago. Good design and feel, easy installation, and relatively fast charging. However, the advertised 125% of extra battery is not even close. I used it a couple of times and it only charged my phone up to 75% with the power case fully charged. Perhaps there is a breaking period, I don't know. Other reviews do not make reference of this. I will give it a week before posting my final rating.  Not so good.. It has been over a month since my first review. The PowerBear does not charge the cellphone beyond 88% when plugged in. The 125% advertised is obviously not true. When the battery is down to, let's say 20%, the fully charged PowerBear is incapable of deliver a full charge. I wish I could return it or exchange it. 11/27/15- it no longer charges beyond the 3rd led and the cell phone cannot detect it anymore. This product was clearly over rated by other users. It looked like a promising product but stop working as intended. I would not recommend anyone to buy this. 3/17/16 update. I file a claim with PowerBear in December 2015 and they replace it, no hassle. The replacement arrive within a week. The new powerpack works as advertised, so the first unit I received was definitely defective. Overall I am please with my purchase. I give PowerBear a 5 star rating for its customer service and product support. I even bought another one for my cousin's iPhone 6, it works perfect. I definitely recommend PowerBear products."
"This is a very good FM transmitter. It did stop working after about six months, but it has a year warranty and they are shipping me a new one. You will get better sound on a high static station."
"Very happy with this Collen case for the Samsung S6 phone .  This is a premium case that helps protect your phone from fingerprints, scratches , and dust and this case is made with anti slip material to help with this being able to grip easier and for it to be comfortable to hold on to .  This case does not block any of the important buttons or speakers and allows you to get to everything that you need to . This fit perfect onto my phone and has stay on and in place. This is made very well and I believe would last a long time . Not only do you get the protection you want for your phone this case is also stylish it self so you also get the extra bonus of it looking like a awesome case.<br /><br />I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion"
It's so cute.  I bought it for a friend as a birthday gift and once I got it in the mail and opened I was literally addicted to the glitter and couldn't stop looking at it.  Definitely buying one of my own soon.
"I have had this phone for less than 6 months and I am having the most problems with it. It has been turning on and off at its on pleasure, it moves extremely slow, wifi barely works on it, and sometimes it doesn't work at all!!!! This product is definitely not worth the money!!!!"
"Amazing battery life, but it's massive. New battery and back were heavier than my entire phone.<br />I was expecting it to be bigger but this more than doubles the phone's thickness and weight.<br />All in all I am happy with the purchase, but I keep this charged and use it as a back up or when I know I won't have my charger for an extended period of time. It is slightly too obnoxious for daily use and just slipping in my pocket or tool-belt."
"There is no cons to this. Super easy to put on and DIY, even for beginners!"
I am a frequent phone dropper...and this case has saved me several times already!  Looks good and keeps that pricey piece of technology intact.  Very glad I bought it.
My cord arrived on Sunday of last week. I went to charge my phone today....no such luck.
its what I expected.made the phone alot bulkier thank it is but the whole purpose is to protect the phone.the door for the cc is a bit tough to open and still have a hard time opening and closing after a week of use. It will hold 4 cc at most
Thin Case protective and simple it makes it one of my favorite cases because it Unintrusive Yet looks good. Very protective.
Pretty good unit for the price. I only had it a week and the led light started flickering and eventually burned out. Now I don't think there is anyway to replace it
when I ordered this phone it was suppose to be new but it has a few scratches on the screen of it !
"I have purchased many remote speaker/mic combos in my quest to find something that will work well AND sound good. This item and the Wouxun SMO-001 are the only 2 out of 10 mics tested worth using. The outbound audio speaker audio qualities of the mic is the best of all I have tested. The mic audio quality of the Wouxun is better than this speaker, but it's hardly fair dinging this item since the two are both head and shoulders above the rest. This item is worth the extra money.  This item feels sturdy and the swiveling clip is outstanding."
I bought this for my sister's 12th birthday and she loves it. I put the product onto the phone and it fits like a glove. The buttons are still nicely responsive (unlike some cases where the buttons are depressed). The case uses a soft silicone material to protect the phone and then has another plastic/rubbery material for the &#34;shell&#34; of the case. This case is definitely worth the money!
Received it on time and in great condition I am very happy with my purchase and will shop again soon
Easy to apply and never any problems with this brand. I will only buy iCarez.
Great value.  Would buy again.
"I go through a lot of Micro USB cables.  They just don't seem to last long before they get loose and I have to wrap them around the phone to get just the right tension in the right direction to make contact.  Thought I was done with this nonsense when phones started to use USB 3.0 connections, but now the new ones are reverting back to USB micro to save space.  So, I needed new cables and these looked good, and were cheap.  The metal ends and braided cover made me hopeful that the contacts were better than the usual cables too.<br />I've been trying to get as much use as possible on this to test it, rotating devices on one cable instead of using all 4 cables and charging everything at once.  It's not the best test since I've only used one of the 4 cables, but one month in and this is when cables usually start to get loose and this is connecting solidly with a nice click and with no play.  Very good!"
"Upon receiving it i was very happy with the screen quality and camera quality. A month later, it's constantly crashing and restarting itself. I use the phone for work, I was going to upgrade and make this my personal phone but the bugs with the phone make it unreliable and not suitable for any kind of heavy use. Needless to say I'm disappointed. Hopefully this helps."
Don't waste your money. This device stopped working after 30 minutes of use.  It won't connect to anything now.
This case looks awesome on my phone and I got a discount promo code for leaving a fair review
"Unfortunately, this device constantly disconnects from my WifFi and therefore cannot be controlled.  It worked initially for a few days, but since then I have been unable to connect to it from my iPhone app, despite unplugging it and resetting it several times.  I also ordered a second WeMo switch and was unable to configure it at all.  In my opinion, this product is not ready for production yet.  It has too many bugs, and is unreliable.  I have ordered a Philips Hue system instead, and it has been reliable."
"The volume and quality of sound from the Splash Speaker is impressive given its size and price. If you have the money to spend there are better outdoor sound systems available—especially if we’re talking about delivering music poolside in your own backyard. Most of those won’t also allow you to answer calls from your phone while you’re swimming, though.<br /><br />At $70 this would be a bit pricey, but it’s actually available from Amazon for under $50—with free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members. If you visit the pool, lake, or beach often I would recommend picking up a Splash Speaker.<br /><br />See the complete review on TechSpective.net: http://techspective.net/2015/05/19/bring-the-noise-with-the-splash-speaker/"
This kit does not include everything needed to install a double din stereo in a bmw e46. It is only the wires and outside trim.... No mounting brackets.
"Awesome. Tons of power to charge phones, ipads, etc. Very tough rubberized package. Given the large capacity and packaging, it might be perfect for your hurricane / tornado / earthquake / zombie apocalypse emergency preparedness kit.  If there were a down side, the waterproof charging jack cover can be a little hard to open. If there were another, the printing by the jacks is kind of hard to read, and the power button is a bit camouflaged as well. Other than that, it simply rocks. Zero issues with Android, iPhones, iPads, etc. Oh yeah, if there were one more negative, it might be overkill, possibly a bit big with too much capacity. Wait What? I'd rather have capacity I don't need than run out of battery when I need it. Its no bigger footprint than my Droid Turbo, and maybe a few times as thick."
"I did an extensive amount of research between the various types of waterproof phone cases before finally deciding on this one. I was skeptical about it so I made sure to test everything as soon as I got it. I tested it like the instructions said and it was water proof. I took it to the beach and the pool on vacation and it worked great! No water. I haven't had any issues with the camera (front or back) like some of the other reviews I saw. The sound for phone calls is definitely a little quieter and can be hard to hear, but the other side of the phone had no issues hearing me. The speaker phone and sound works great! The only real issue I had was that when I dropped it, the case slightly popped off. Other than that, you just have to make sure everything is on. I went around my phone twice to make sure it was shut tight, as well as making sure the ports on the bottom are sealed before taking it in the water.<br /><br />Update: after a couple months, the film that covers the thumb sensor ripped, which is very disappointing considering everything else was great. It leaked water inside the case and my phone got wet."
"Battery gives about 2 hours. I bought this to use during my marathon run. I would need at least 4 hours of power.<br />8/30<br />Confirmed, it gives 2 hours of play time.<br />Don't bother buying this brand.<br /><br />The fit is little uncomfortable. I will try the different covers and update in the next few days."
"The charger port cover doesn't stay in the case after charging over night and sticks out a little, other than that a great case."
that  not what i was expect did not eve try
It's nice to be able to control how bright (one light or 2).  The bendy neck and sturdy clip are very handy. It has a slot where it could be plugged in but doesn't come with a cord. I searched for hours trying to find a compatible plug in and never found one.
I love this radio woks good there was a delay in the delivery but it was worth the wait. I just use it as a scanner it works fine I also ordered the mic to go with its I can receive pages from fire departments over 30 miles away comes with everything in the picture.
"It met all expectations, fits good and phone works great in thecase. I like the belt clip that it comes with."
"Love the portable charger, it's slim and perfect for my purse, any size"
"I love this case!  I love Pink!  I was very easy to put on.  Once I put it on, if fits very well.  I get a great protective case in a slim design.  It is still able to fit in my pocket when I need it to.  It also came with a screen protector that was very easy to put on.  The directions were easy to follow.I love to change my phone case out frequently so now I can add this to my collection of cases.  I will definitely keep this one around for awhile!  I got this case at a discount to try out in exchange for my honest review."
As specified. iphone6 doesn't fit so well. Still a decent amount of space left. Sometimes a one size fits all doesn't fit all.
"Couldn't handle my iPhone 6+ without swiveling. No matter how hard I tightened things up, within a few minutes it was loose and swiveling. The latch system in the CD player worked great, held well, but the phone would end up loose and rotating within a short time. I may try changing out their screw for a bolt, get everything aligned and try and tighten with Loctite or something, but should be useable from factory."
"Really nice earbuds, I recently lost my other pair but this replacement exceeded my expectations, the volume is great, the buds don't hurt my small ears, and I like the mic functionality. The packaging could've been a little better, but it's okay because we all know what headphones are. I highly recommend this product as it meets my standards. I received this product for a discount or for free in exchange of an honest and unbiased review.<br /><br />Update: right side went out, then left side went out a few days later. :/"
I love my I phone 6 case. Even though this case may not look like it will protect your phone it does. I have dropped my phone numerous times and my phone has been fine.
"This phone case looks fabulous however I had some issues with it. First off, I go it on a weekend so didn't use it until Monday on my way to work. I wore it less than an hour when the pin that hold the belt clip together slides out and my phone hits the sidewalk. Luckily I was able to find all the pieces and put it back together. I dabbed a small bit of superglue on the end to ensure that the pin wouldn't slip out again and everything is working fine now. One other Issue is that the velvet insert on the belt clip is already coming unglued from the inside. While this is not a big issue as it doesn't actually serve any real purpose I would like to keep this thing in a nice condition longer than a month. and the stylus that comes with it is made of cheap plastic and there is now where to carry it."
"Got my order today fits great,comfortable, I don't like earbuds but I like how this fits I would recommend this to anyone!! Thanks"
Great product  it inhances my phone thks
"Perfect. Outside watching the USA Pro Challenge all day and charged my wife's phone and my at the same time, in no time. Glad I bought it.<br /><br />Update: Dropped from a foot high onto wood desk and the case hase a big chip in it. Not very rugged."
"Everything in the bundle worked just fine except for the earplugs. I emailed the company because they weren't working at all. The company sent me another pair and those still weren't working. So i just left it alone and bought some more expensive earplugs that i know for sure would work. My advice to the company, take the earplugs out the bundles. They serve no justice!"
"I actually like this band better than the Apple sport band!  Material is slightly thinner, very comfortable, great price. I wound up buying two colors!"
"I read and watched every story and video that I could find, and it was easier than I thought. Just watch as many videos and I don't think you should have a problem.  This screen was inexpensive but great quality, fitting and looks perfect."
"Really builky and ugly. It's got good protection for your phone but the back is too shiny, the kickstand broke."
did not work and looked bad. They did send a credit for this so all was not lost. I had to buy a different one and this one works just fine
I have a Honda Accord 2004 this product is amazing the sound of the aux is better than my original CD player and it's easy to install I did it in 30 min I bought the isimple cable that was recommended with this product it worked the best if you buy different cheap cables you might have problem with the sound I recommend buying the cables that was recommended with this product
"The case fits amazingly, its thicker but that is what i wanted it for. came with a screen cleaner as well.  the color is spot on and i just love it! great price too!"
"[[VIDEOID:b011e6223cc1bbaabdd79ef065b7f377]] The video really covers most all I'd say of this unit but I will add a few quick thoughts.<br /><br />Color/design...weird but I don't dislike it.<br /><br />Shake for status...different and I like it.<br /><br />Charge a phone (or whatever you connect) while charging the unit...not all power banks can do this...BONUS.<br /><br />I really like it even though I think it looks rather weird due to the pattern. It is a pretty slim size for the capacity and it'll charge your device well all while standing out and looking more unique. I kinda like oddities and this sort of qualifies.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
"This product is super high quality and is a MUST for tweens, teens and accident-prone adults!"
Excellent quality. Works great
"This is great. I honestly didn't think I would be having so much fun with a selfie, since I've only really learned this term a little over a year ago (by my nieces!) This stick was so easy to use, and I've had so much fun with it, that I felt like a kid myself, taking crazy silly pictures with me. Ironically, it has brought me closer to my nieces! That has been an unusual and very pleasant surprise! I just don't have anything negative to say about this right now, since I've had so much fun with it! I felt like a kid again! What can I say? It has brought many smiles to my face! Just a silly little stick has brought many smiles and good silly moments, how could I not give it 5 stars! Against., I'm not a millennial, so the whole selfie concept was new to me, but I can see what the fuss is all about. But back to this product, it was easy to use, and in the a minute, it was working. It was fantastic! Even for an inexperienced &#34;selfie&#34; person like me. What can I say, buy one and have a few laughs! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. However, I never guarantee a positive review. I honestly had  more fun with this than I thought I would!"
These work very well and this is the second pack I have bought.  I keep losing them because I don't attach them to my tablets!!  Make sure the tips stay screwed on and they work very well.  Very precise and you don't have to tap hard at all.
"Purchased this for my Note 5 and was extremely impressed. For starters the people who say this does not fit or is not made for a Note 5 are completely incorrect. The fit was perfect and I don't consider myself an expert. I watched a YouTube video on installation and it took me 1 attempt, the adhesive applied itself with no bubbles, no halo, all my edges were perfect and it didn't take any adjusting. The glass feel and look are a pleasure, the prior reviews scared me but I think it's purely coming down to user error. I am happy I went with this brand considering the simplicity, cost, and great look afterwards."
Compact and efficient. Perfect.
Within a month the plastic screen cracked and the button covering the charger insertion broke off. Piece of junk. Don't waste your money!!
Great case fits as designed
It wasn't  the quality I expected.
this my third cord-not a good cord -Amazon needs to do a better job if they want to put the Amazon name on the product-overseas customer service not good either!
"Lightweight, easy to hold - even when I'm tired and reading at night. No problems with sand sticking to the interior when I took it to the beach. Latches well, magnets don't overhold but provide enough stick. The deep brown burnished color is like a beautiful wood desk."
"Works as described. I have three things I can charge using this device and while I haven't charged them all at the same time, I could do so if needed. I am somewhat concerned about the electric crackle I get when I plug the device into the wall, but nothing untoward happens afterward (no smells, no quick build up of heat). Maybe the device is just eager to grab the power..."
Runs the Microsoft surface 3. this doesn't look or feel cheap . Great product  thank you Anker.
"Tried this with three phones so far: Galaxy S3, iPhone6, and LG S2 (as well as a 10\\"" tablet ;-).  Works fine on all of them, but the newer phones work better of course. My older Galaxy S2 didn't work since the Android OS was not at rev 4 or above.  On the Galaxy S3, the pixels are very visible and somewhat objectionable.  On the iPhone6, they are visible, but generally acceptable.  On the LG S2, the resolution is somewhere in-between (acceptable though).  And the tablet?  It worked since it presented the VR app's videos in split-screen in a small area of the screen (about 4.7\\"" diagonal region).  But its pretty bad resolution since its then using a small subset of the overall screen.  And of course you have to fold over the Cardboard front cover and hold it carefully in position - not a generally usable approach !<br /><br />On all phones tried, the phones fit well and stayed in place.  Most important, the immersion you get is very good and my field of view was well filled. In my opinion, the only thing lacking is a sharper, realistic image.  But that is not the fault of the Cardboard.  The fact that you can see the pixels even on a modern iPhone6 clearly means the lenses are excellent and the experience is limited by the phone.  Moreover, if you look carefully at the scenes, you can see they are quite low resolution - sometimes lower than the pixel resolution itself. So all this Cardboard needs is a couple more generations of phones with 2 to 4 times the resolution they have now. I wonder if that will happen - since there is no need for it other than when it is magnified like this. But in the next gen, at least the processor power should increase, allowing more high-res computer-generated scenes.<br /><br />NOTE:  I found that I had a tendency to hold the Cardboard a little too low - with my forehead touching the top of it.  If I pushed it up a little then the image became more clear.  Some experimenting with such alignment issues is important for a good effect.<br/><br />Very cool thing for folks using Android phones:  Using Android's YouTube app, search for \\""360 video\\"".  There are _lots_ of \\""360\\"" vids, and no need to install a separate app for each thing you're viewing.  And they're just as good in quality as the dedicated VR apps that I've tried.  Calling them 360 is not doing them justice.  They are, like the VR apps, generally capable of showing you stuff overhead and underfoot, as well as in a 360 degree circle.  Be sure to hit the Cardboard symbol in the lower right corner of the video when its playing in order to get it into split-screen mode. Unfortunately, this doesn't work yet on iPhones.  You can see 360 video when using the phone by itself, but there is no icon to put it into split-screeen mode to able to use it with Cardboard which adds 3D and immersion.  Apparently they're working on getting the iPhone a suitable app though."
Works well and hooks up via bluetooth easily. Only criticism is that the rubber hand grip will twist if you're not careful and makes the photo button on it very difficult to press.  You then have to try to re-align the grip with the button to be able to take any pictures.  I also haven't had any issues with the battery life yet neither.
This case looks really cute. Definitely a good case to get if you like R2D2. Good quality for the price.
"It is good product but when I open the back cover, it has dried spaghetti sauce on it.  :) I cleaned it up and no problem.  However, the charger does work.  I contacted the seller and they will send another new charger to me.  The phone works fine and no problem so far.  Wish they check and clean it up before shipping."
"These are great.  For someone who has trouble typing on a small screen, like me, these are perfect. Helps the typing be accurate and not having to backtrack and retype over and over again.  Definitely recommend."
"Comparing to another one that I bought the quality is a little poor, but works good."
"Great product, nice app, navigation feature in app not as good as others but is ok. Only four stars because tension springs are a little two strong. I haven't checked yet but I am sure I can modify that."
"Couldn't get a better deal for a better price, the multi colored pack of ten are awesome. I have a different use for each one around the house. Also put one in my car. Not poorly made, will buy again in I need to in the future."
I have the Samsung 4 & this works perfectly for me. Stick it to the windshield Then adjust the angle that works best for you & you're ready to go! Set the angle that is best for your viewing & you can see your phone while driving. You don't have to fumble to find your phone it is visible at all times. Makes for safer driving.
"I haven't put it to my phone yet,but the pen that comes with it is the answer to no more fingerprints.thanks to Amazon and Supershields.Eusebio V."
"Fit of the case is nice but it's a little too tight for the leather back version of the G4. The case will rip out the leather battery cover every time you remove it from the case. You literally have to fish around the case in order to remove the battery cover from the case, the leather will only degrade as time goes on I would assume."
"This is an excellent phone case, it fit my LG Power perfectly.  The only thing I didn't care for was the fact the case itself was kinda dirty, it left a black residue on my fingers until I cleaned it off with a touch of soap and water.  I'm not sure if this was because of the dirtiness, but the case smells like mushrooms, no joke.  I've purchased enough junk from around the world the know that the smell will fade in time, its just awkward to be talking on my phone and have to breath away from it.  But the best part of all, its the friggin' TARDIS.  Though the product description says nothing of Dr. Who, its still a blue police call box."
"My note 4 fits perfect, but it's not holding up very well. I will probably  order again because it is so inexpensive."
Great.  Very surprised at the quality and look
"Very disappointed. Super cute looking but like everyone else has said, pink paisley back is coming off and one volume button fell off."
"Good looking,  protective case at a fraction of the cost of an otterbox,  etcI did receive this as a sample to try but I would am giving this an honest appraisal - I have owned otterbox and life proof in the past and this is as good as otterbox and better than life proof in my opinion"
"It slipped out of her hands and fell face first on the cement driveway. It looked as tho the screen was cracked but upon removing your screen protector, the Samsung NOTE 5 CELLPHONE was in perfect condition! No cracks, no scratches! And my Mom was very thandful she just had to buy me a new screen protector and not a new phone. Thank you for a great product!!"
"The product is exactly what I needed. My wife was sceptical when I purchased it and could not understand why I wanted it. However, now that I have it, she is going to get one. It is great to use with our iPhones/iPads. It is sturdy and has several settings that easily adjust with a single button. My wife has been using mine to allow the grandchildren watch videos on her iPad."
"*** I felt the need to update this feedback.   I have since figured out the menu a little more and found a way to control the sound quality much better.  I must say that I finally got it to sound great!!   There was a way to boost specific ranges of audio.  With this, it sounds great!  However, I still feel that the menu is a little difficult to navigate.  For one example, it took me a couple months to find that audio adjustment that finally made it sound great.  Also, when I accidentally push in the volume knob and the menu comes on, I don't know how to get out of it without turning off the deck.  I'll probably figure this out soon, but it is a pain that it is not more user friendly.  (Previous message) - I'm not extremely pleased with the menu and controls and I had to tweak the EQ quite a bit to even get a sound that I could tolerate.  All of the pre-set EQ settings sound like garbage.  However, now that I got the custom setting dialed in and am used to the controls a little, the deck does do what I expected.  Next time I might spend a little more for something a little more user-friendly and higher quality, but this one does the job."
"great looking S6 Galaxy Case, I'm very please with this product. Strong, supportive, to the phone I have,,, I give this product a 5 of 5 star approval"
such a fun quirky phone case! especially for myself who does photography. its always a huge hit when i bring it with me to my photoshoots.
"Over 6000 reviews. Will my review add anything? I ordered these ear buds after a lot of research. I first saw them on CNET and viewing the video described and review, checked them out here on Amazon reviews and found a lot of happy users of the buds.<br /><br />Soundpeats Qy7 4.1 Bluetooth Ear Buds<br /><br />Arrived in a couple of days after being neglected to be sent in an original order and corrected and resent. I usually don't comment on packaging but the first thing you'll notice is just that. The package represents quality. Heavy duty box with great graphics and design. Sealed to prove its never been open, if so beware, and a list and graphic of included items on the side. I have read in the reviews that some of these buds all aren't created equal and some come without all the little goodies.<br /><br />Opening the box you find a carry case and the instruction sheet. Like my Dad said read twice and do once. The sheet is informative and pretty easy to follow. I never understood and to this day can't figure out why a lot of the reviews here on Amazon complain about figuring out how to work with these buds. What is the right ear bud, how to open the charging flap, when the buds are fully charged and on and on. All of those things and much more are well explained in the institution sheets.<br /><br />The case, AHHHHHH yes the case. I have through research seen a lot of adds and reviews and very few at any price includes a case, not even a cheaply made one let alone a hard shell case. A case doesn't do anything to improve sound quality I know. Between the packaging and the case though it does give you a sense of a well made product and consciousness of of the manufacturing.<br /><br />Opening the zippered case inside you find the ear buds, USB charging cable, extra different sized ear inserts and a bunch of little pieces that can be used to hold these guys in your ears. I have read some not so kind reviews of these ear buds falling out of ears during exercise and heavier activities. I don't have that problem due to a handicap but I can understand. Looking at these ear extensions I think with a little experimentation some of those problems could be eliminated. This I can't be sure of. There is also a clip that attaches the buds to a shirt collar or something else and secures the cords to help reduce movement and the hollow or wind tunnel affect the cords can make. Now I have read that the majority if not all Bluetooth buds and earphones have the same problem. Again I'm no expert so don't hold me to that fact. As far as ear inserts and sizing, the inserts that were installed fit my ears perfectly. I have no way of knowing how easy or difficult it is to replace these inserts. I do know from previous buds that replacement of inserts has caused many a problem for me. Again that could be because of my handicap, Parkinson's, causing tremors of my hand and arm. Hopefully someone has done this and can report.<br /><br />Now on to the setting up and listening. Again if you read the instructions closely and twice as Dad told me you'll have no or very little difficulty. Charging was my most difficult problem. The cap covering the mini USB connection on the buds is small and well fitting. Again because of my hand tremors it was quite difficult to open the charging port cover. I had a friend use a Emory cloth to scruff up the tab to make it easier to push it back and open. My friend also suggested a small pin hole or even a piece of tape. I'm sure the average person with average sized fingers and finger nails should have very little difficulty. Charging is a snap. One end into the standar USB charger, I use my Apple iPhone charger, and the mini end into the buds. There will be a red light that comes on. After charging the red light turns to blue when fully charged. I have no idea the full length to charge. The first time I chafed it the red light went off after less than a half hour. The second time I didn't watch. I also read that the type of charger you use can make a difference. I have a few Apple products all with quick chargers and have used one of those. I have not yet connected to a computer USB or other port. Pairing was once again simple. Press the ear bud for 3 seconds and wait for the blue light. Turn you audio devise on, adjust your Bluetooth setting to on and wait for the two to find each other. That simple. I turned off all other Bluetooth devises to make it much simpler to identify. When paired the devise name is QY7. I have read you may get a different devise name.<br /><br />Results are great no in my opinion better than great. Let me state right up front I am not an audiophile. I do know when something sounds good or bad though. The sound coming through the buds are unbelievable. The bass is enough to force you to reduce the volume. Not because of distortion but damn they're loud. The treble is also great and not a bit tinny. I like all music from classical to rock, from New Age to jazz and in not one genre this these buds disappoint. I also purchased these to occasionally listen to streaming Video on my TV and iPad. Once again I'm no expert but it's theater sound quality.<br /><br />I guess I've had made a fantastic choice. The research was most helpful and the reviews here on Amazon also helped greatly. There also are a few good videos on YouTube you can look up as well as the one on CNET. Check these and other reviews to come to your own conclusion.<br /><br />I purchased these ear buds and received no payment assistant through any giveaway or promotion.e of charger you use can make a difference.

cord quality is so-so. good value though.
These speakers work very well. They put out good quality sound especially considering how small they are. Good speaker for the price.
"Excellent , the best cover case"
"The photo on the phone case is blurry & kind of looks like a really s***ty quality printer. I really love the design but I was not expecting that because in the actual preview, it looks really clear. It's also glued to the plastic case so it's very cheaply made. A little disappointed especially considering that I paid $13.28, it was not eligible for free shipping & it took about 3 weeks to get to me."
"I thought that getting braided cords would be good for longevity, which they are. The crummy part about these cords are the connectors. After about 2 weeks of nightly use *EVERY* single one no longer would charge my Nexus 6, Nexus 7, or Note 4 and there is absolutely ZERO damage to the connectors on the phones or tablet. DO NOT BUY THESE CORDS - SUPER CHEAP CHINESE CRAP"
loved this phone for the first couple of days after the third day i started having problems with it. After i lock the screen all shyt hit the fan so to say. after putting in my pin to unlock the phone i couldn't add people to my contact unless i flipped the phone on it's side even when installing apps i couldn't check the progress of the app unless i flipped the phone and i couldn't close the web browser at all had to press power button. sent it back but it takes 21 days to get a new one so i'm assed out till i get it.
"These replaced my alnico DJ-580t's.  They have the same exact features and work almost as well.  The receiver is NOT as sensitive or clear as the 15 year old alnico but the price also wasn't comparable.  This is a good little dual bander cross band repeater.  My biggest gripe is weaker receiver, seemingly short transmit range, convoluted menus.  Overall it is a good replacement on a budget.  YOU MUST USE COMMANDER TO PROGRAM IT, unless you have 15 years to program it.  Also I cant figure out how to set it to a single VFO.  My alinco had that option.  Her voice is also annoying.  Wouxun should try a sexy female British voice.  Guess I have more than one gripe!  again a good budget radio and I would recommend it."
Nice case for a great price fit very good
"Love it love it.  I needed something to play music at a work site and this has been perfect.  It was a great price, the battery lasts a long time and it really has a great sound."
"I love this case and I never have cases on my phone. I always roll my phone without a case. I don't see the point in buying the thinnest phone and then having the biggest case you can buy on it. All cases seem so bulky. Even the thinner cases have the raised edges which I don't like. This case is very thin and has perfect cutouts for the speaker, charge port and rear camera. The nice thing about the case is the back is just thick enough to make the rear of the phone flush with the protruding camera. I would highly recommend this case to anyone like me who doesnt like the bulk of traditional case."
Good price and works
Well this is not the watch that was mailed to us. But the one that came in the mail works good.
"Great, easy to use selfie stick.  This is the best one out there! I highly recommend for anyone that likes to travel and likes to take lots of selfies."
"Does the job of charging the cell phone battery it shipped with. Unfortunately my other batteries that fit my phone will not charge using this unit, including Samsung batteries. So I have to keep a second charger around for those. Strange."
Very nice glasses. Neatly packed
Seems to work just fine.  Only use it for the rare occasions when I run out of internal power.
"I have dropped my phones about a dozen times in a year. One time my phone slipped right as I got out of my SUV and sent straight down into asphalt on a corner. The phone just jumped back up a dozen inches and slam into the asphalt again. Nothing, absolutely no damage to the body of the phone."
"I see lot of reviews saying that it doesn't stick but I've had this now for several months now and it has stuck to my windshield throughout the time with no problems. I have never removed it from the spot I had originally stuck it to. I keep it on the left side out of the way and just clip my cellphone on it whenever I need to. I the only issue which is minor I seen is that it can get loose around the neck and requires tightening every now and then so the phone stays pointing in the direction you want.<br /><br />Also to add, I have a big big Samsung Galaxy Note 4 with a huge case, and it fits this perfectly, very surprisingly can hold up all the weight too throughout any trips I've taken."
"Stay in your ear, sound ok for price.  Easy setup and Bluetooth is very good."
"Its  high quaility!!!  Very strong ,made well construction"
"Only ergo minus in design is the fourth quarter light that blinks, even after fully charged. Other thee quarter lights remain on after percentage of charge is archived.  All other features are solidly designed and constructed.  Used in conjunction with GoPro Session4, it extended the battery life of the cube cam while recording, with a USB mini and 64 GB SD card. Recording time went from a little more than 2 hours to the recording capacity of the SD (5 hrs. 26 min.). Although, a sacrifice of the Session 4 not being water tight anymore."
I ordered several of these for my employees. Half of them did not work. Couldn't hear anything when they spoke. Wasted money.
"this case is one of the best cases i have ever bought. this offers the same level of protection as an otter box, but it costs less than half the price.i like this better than most cases and i don't have to worry about dropping it when I'm running around between school and work. this case offers a built screen protecter that is not too good but it doesn't really matter since i used a temper glass screen protecter underneath. if you want to save money and have great protection but this case."
Love it - and I have dropped my phone numerous times and the rubber has saved the face!  It's unscathed!
"Very good set of basic stylus pens. No issues, come with 3ea spare tips, very comfortable and lightweight. All metal, makes them feel very resilient and robust.  Size of a normal pen, exactly as advertised. There are surely better ones out there, but for the price, I cannot imagine a better value."
"Seems fine. Admittedly, I haven't had experience with any other screen protectors, but I'm satisfied with the MyBat. Just remember to work as clean as possible, in as a dust-free environment as you can find. Cold, dry days with a lot of static are not good."
Large enough to accommodate the phone with a thin protective case.  Allows easy access to the phone's headphone port.
"I love this cord! The charger doesn't work in the front of my van, so I bought this to run from the trunk to the drivers seat. I need power on my phone after using the gps, so this works great. I like the color too!"
Don't buy this item. It's a scam. Nothing like the picture. It literally is a cheap white plastic phone case with a photocopied crappy picture of the kate spade design.
Works as expected from a well respected brand
"This is so far the best bluetooth I have used.  Easy to power on off, long range, mute button and volume up and down are good.  And phone quality is very good per feedback from people I talk with.  The down side - the volume button WILL come off eventually after having it for about 9 months.  Still I have not found a better functional bluetooth for this price so I jsut have a few of them.."
Spectacular! I've tried many knockoff cables but these consistently work and do a remarkable job. It seems that I'm always losing cables and this is an affordable way to make sure I've never without.
"I dropped my phone for many times, but it still protected my phone very well. Only one con, it doesn't fit the iPhone 6 tightly."
"It does everything, a bit large but its very nice."
"I was hesitant at first after seeing some appalling clone bands that are destroyed after 2-3 wears, took a chance on the Katrice and it's awesome. Quality is great, texture is very close to the real Apple product but just a tad lighter than the real one (a perk for me since i have a tiny wrist).<br /><br />Shine and is great too, honestly it looks like the real thing. Definitely worth the money."
"Unless I read it wrong, this is supposed to be a new battery. My package seal was broken and battery is not any better than my current old battery."
"I have ordered 2 of these at different times, each of them worked for exactly ONE (1) day!<br /><br />Sorry company, sorry product~<br /><br />Joyce Christopher<br />imark.ent1@gmail.com"
Bottom opening was misplaced so unable to use. Other than that would have been a good case for the price.
"It took a very long time to get here, but that is because it comes from Hongkong. Other than that, the pen is great. Just like the original one."
These chargers are the real deal ... After traveling for two weeks in Greece  they kept my I phone and iPad fully charged at all times .  I never once worried about charging my appliances on the go ..  Don't leave home without them.😀😀😀😀😀
"Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />This is a very attractive case in my opinion, but beyond that I don't find a whole lot of use for it.  It is a hard case which from past experience I find will crack if ever dropped.  Of course that is preferable to your phone breaking, but would need to be replaced should this occur.  Additionally, this only provides protection on the back and sides.  With a glass screen protector on there is no extension whatsoever past the screen, and the phone itself extends past the case on the bottom.  The case does extend a tiny bit past the top of the phone and barely covers each corner.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking more for aesthetics than protection and this is in your ballpark price-wise then go for it, it does look nice.  I prefer a little more protection because I think it's easily achievable with adding only the slightest amount to the overall dimensions; i.e. I think it should extend just a bit more around each edge."
"When I got my first iphone many years ago, there was a Speck case in the store on clearance that I purchased with itand never looked back. Everytime I get the newest iphone, I scour the internet for a great sale on Speck Candy-Shell cases. I picked this up for $13.99, less than half of the normal selling price. The Candy Shell is a protective dual-layer hard-shell case (hard outer shell with rubber inside). It really is my favorite case and it has saved many an iPhone drops. I've gotten 3 for the iPhone 6 (different colors because I like to switch) and one of them seemed to have the issue of the rubber wearing off where it was annoying. The white one is fine and so was the blue. The black had the issue for mebut 1 outta 3 isn't that bad and i did get a few months use before it started happening."
the cables are nice looking and sturdy and the are long enough for your everyday needs..however there is an issue I have a lg g3 and not all of the cables seem to charge the device as they should be..3 of the 5 that I recived can charge my device properly the other 2 don't so I use them to charge other devices like game controlers and to pair my x box with my cell phone...I have an aukey charger that has quick charge in one of the ports I tested the 3 cables that work ok with the quick charge port and my brother's galaxy s6 recognize the quickcharge port while charging the phone with the 3 cables that work well...I might have had bad luck with the other 2 that work so so but in general it was a good purchase.
"holds the phone great (although the USB ports on it with the GPS running on my S5 really don't have the umph to keep the phone charged, just slows the discharge some) but I used my charger so I was manly concerned how well it holds the phone steady and it does a good job at that."
"My husband really likes this case.  It gives a little extra grip without adding much bulk at all.  I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't provide much protection for the phone from drops, but these phones are pretty durable as it is so you really don't need a whole lot of protection."
this cable is super durable and very long it is a very fast and doesn't get tangled for its price this is probably the best micro usb cable I have ever used
"Not much to say expect you are paying top dollar for the confidence that the connector is as good as it can be.  Some of the inexpensive ones in the aftermarket will prove themselves to be junk, and Murphy's Law dictates that they'll fail at the worst possible time. But how can you know in advance?<br /><br />This one will prove itself to be highest quality."
A tota rip off. Doesn't even look anything like the picture. I should of read the reviews before I bought it but i was too excited to get it. It's a cheap knockoff. I wouldn't give them any stars if it was possible.
Screen works great. Only 3 star cause I contacted seller about the home button being purple when I ordered blue screen. Didn't seem to care as long as screen worked. Other than that it's awesome.
"Great item, in quality and design. It is compact and is user friendly. Definitely worth it and again it was a pleasure doing business with Eoso. Communication between seller and buyer has never been better. Because of everything I said I am a repeat customer, I've purchased several accessories for my iPhone 6 from Eoso and will continue to go to Eoso for all of my iPhone needs. Five star all around!!! This is the last selfie stick you will ever buy; unless you want another one in a different color :)"
"Will not hold a charge.  works OK, but battery (different battery) will discharge even while connected to charger (different chargers).  Waitng for replacement, but don't hold much hope.  Luckily, bought through AMAZON, so replacement is easy."
Great product! Easy to install!
"Excellent case.  I am enjoying my time using it thusly.  Every day I get to use it, it makes me feel nice."
This product stopped working after 4 months. Would not purchase again.
"Had this case for a couple month and was great at  first. Unfortunately now the back door will not stay shut and slide open. That is the reason for 3 stars other then that, I think important, issue it is a nice case. Unfortunately with the door loose I can no longer hold anything of any importance in it for fear that it will fall out. So now it is just another case like many others out there."
While I was waiting for the phone case I dropped and broke my phone when the case got here I put it in a drawer and said oh well!  Thanks anyway
"Small, light weight, looks good & functions great!  What more can you ask for?  Oh yeah, good price!"
"I purchased two adapters and only 1 of them worked, the other was DOA.  After 5 weeks the one that worked died.  Not sure if this was only a problem for me, or if the quality control for the adapter is that bad.<br /><br />I definitely recommend staying away from these adapters."
"I received this product Thursday, put it on my daughters ipad and it already started coming off. I went to put the outside silicone part back on the hard case and it tore. It didn't even last two days."
"Love this case, shipping took longer than expected but The case has been great over all! Has kept my phone protected also."
"good quality screen.. but the tolerances for the holes were a bit tight, so getting it just right so it will not block the home button or the camera opening was a bit trickier than others of the same kind I've used.  otherwise, nice clear screen."
My Smart phones work well for me because I could see everything because  My vision is bad plus w have wide fingers an the  pad was bigger than the other phones.
"The plastic that holds the phone fell apart after a few weeks and the phone dropped out, luckily no damage. My wife was not happy. I jerryrigged something using an old case to make things work but for the price they have a million better choices."
"This is a charging cable, with a standard USB plug on one end and then a micro-USB plug on the other end, with a difference. Incorporated into the cable is a small battery pack that can be used to provide some supplemental or emergency power to a cell phone when needed. The battery has a switch on the side, which is used to select whether or not the cable is to be used for connecting (sync or charge), or if the battery is to be used, in which case the cable won't support data transfer or sync.<br /><br />The battery presumably is charged through normal usage as the cable is used to charge a phone or tablet, and if it is receiving a charge then it will surely reduce the charging current that is delivered to the phone, for at least as long as the battery takes to become fully charged. No real technical information is provided, so it's hard to say whether or not the battery is protecting itself against overcharging or how many charging cycles it will accept before it loses it's ability to hold and provide a charge. If the battery is not used occasionally and the cable is simply used as a normal charge and sync cable, then my assumption is that the battery will simply be kept at full charge and be ready for use whenever it is finally asked to provide a charge.<br /><br />The cable is micro-USB only, so use with Apple devices requiring a lightning cord will require an adaptor. It's a short cable as well at ½ meter (just over a foot and a half).<br /><br />The battery capability of 400 mAh is quite small of course, only sufficient to provide perhaps a quarter charge at best to a smart phone. There is no indication light so it's impossible to know whether the battery is charged or not, and if charged how much, so the only thing you can do is plug it into a phone and see whether or not it shows that a charge is being received by the phone.<br /><br />At ten bucks, this is a respectable value from the standpoint that many cables by themselves will cost about the same.<br /><br />Poweradd is a company that has a product line with a range of batteries, cables and cell phone accessories, and it's well established on Amazon will a good seller reputation.<br /><br />I give this 4-stars based upon my own impressions of the features and quality. I think that the usefulness of this product is limited, due to the small battery capacity, but it's a fair value. I have not used a device of this type in the past so I can't claim to be able to compare it with other similar devices.<br /><br />If I encounter any additional points worth noting, as I use this over time, I will return to this review and update it accordingly.<br /><br />I received a sample of this combination cable and battery pack at no cost from the seller and for the purpose of review, and I have no affiliation with either the seller, or Amazon.<br />Poweradd is a company that has a product line with a range of batteries, cables and cell phone accessories, and it's well established on Amazon will a good seller reputation.<br /><br />I give this 4-stars based upon my own impressions of the features and quality.

"I love the phone ! , it's almost like a steal. Feels premium, very responsive and extremely fast. I have witnessed no lag what so ever ...compared to my lg g4 this phone wins in a performance test. And the ability to set different users is a plus !!!!"
I love my headset. I got my product quickly. The seller was great too.
"This product is garbage! The tempered glass didn't even stick on the phone! there are round circle marks,Bubbles around every edge, I was very annoyed that I wasted money on this product! I would not buy again!"
Install is okay.. but the back film wraps around to the metal edges and if installed right ur ok... if not u get the film peeling as u put the phone in ur pocket or plainly using the phone...
Stopped working after only a few months
A bit thicker yet the touch screen still works. Great for extra protection
This is the best installation kit I've gotten for this price range. Wires were definitely good quality. I will be using this again.
"This case is great!  It has a hard shell so if you drop it you feel pretty safe having coverage to this degree for the back at least.  Doesn't make the phone bulky.  The slide to put cards in is a little difficult to open but loosens up over time, only reason I took away 1 star.  Highly recommend and would purchase again!"
"Can barely tell it is on, clear, goes on easily with no bubbles and doesn't interfere with touchscreen capabilities. Daughter dropped her phone while dancing and this screen protector cracked, but saved her iPhone screen! Well worth it!"
It didn't work. It wouldn't charge. I had to argue with them to get my 6 bucks back. I got a good one from Best Buy for the same price.
there is no glare but the cover doesn't help with the screen's brightness like I had hoped. I still need to increase the brightness whenever i go outside.
"This is the perfect little device if you travel abroad or, more uncommonly, need to be able to use different socket styles at home – although we’ve been in France for nearly ten years, we still have UK 4-gangs in use.  As almost everything is powered by the ubiquitous 5V USB standard, being able to charge/power two devices simultaneously from any socket design, supplying up 2.4A per port for those power hungry tablets (apparently, I don’t have one yet!) has got to be pretty handy, especially on holiday with any number of mobile devices to keep charged.<br /><br />The interchangeable plug design is clever and the unit feels robust and well made, so switching between UK and European sockets has not presented a problem – no doubt the locking mechanism and lugs will wear eventually but with normal use it should last for ages. The two USB ports will both supply up to 2.4A with the actual current used being displayed on the LCD screen. When no current is being drawn the screen automatically turns off.<br /><br />This is an ideal multi-purpose USB charger both at home for general use and on those trips abroad. An excellent and very useful bit of kit – thanks to the good people at Allreli for the opportunity to test the product in return for a free unit."

Ray Nicholson raynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com @ralannicholson"
It has a really good sound but tends to disconnect from Bluetooth a lot.  Even if it is fully charged...
Not worth the money. No lip protection on front and barely protects anything.
"Its very soft, looks great, comfortable to wear, softer than the original apple sport band, stylish and great"
Its hard plastic  we thought  it was sofa and rubbery  but nope its nice the picture  looks much better on the post instead  of  real life but it's okay my daughter  loves it
Fits my phone well. It only comes with one screen protector-- so you'd better be careful putting it on. I was worried about the many negative reviews about the fit but so far so good.
"I was pleased to see that the Neocon Solar Panel Charger could recharge my 6 inch Android ZTE Quartz smartphone to about 90% on one full charge.  Using a quick charger (2A) the charger still takes several hours to recharge from AC, and in intense August Florida sun it only got to maybe 3/4 charge after 12 hours in full sunlight.  That is a bit disappointing in that it would take forever to get a full charge, if it even can get one in the sun.  So I hesitate to recommend this charger for anything but the occasional emergency recharge.  Not a good solution for camping trips and relying on the sun."
Simple but nice. Hubby didn't want one now he has one and loves it too.
This pouch case is great! The phone fits perfectly and is not a struggle like other cases I have purchased.
Husband needed to have notifications while driving. Keeps his hands on the wheel and knows whats going on. Great stuff.
Great case well worth the money. I am really glad  I decided to buy it.
"Seems very durable and isn't too bulky, and fits like a glove. Has the correct cutouts for the external microphones and speakers. Generally seems to have very high build quality. (Note: I don't use the holster, just the case)"
"Excellent packaging, really sleek feel doesn't make my phone feel bulky looks nice and stylish and it fits snug as a glove!! I highly recommend this case to anyone who has a note 5! Well worth the amount I paid for it!! Downside it is false advertising outside casing is not steel it's hard plastic.."
What a waste of money! Every day the date always resets to 1/1/2012. Also it randomly erases my videos and the quality isnt very good either. Guess i got a knoch off.
Even though I'm not very good with this kind of stuff I absolutely love this selfie stick! There  have been so many times that<br />I wanted to take certain pictures but could not because i could not get the right angle. This is by far the best thing i have found as I can now get pictures that would never have turned out before!
"This case is adorable and soft to the touch. It protects lightly because it is more of a cover case and not so much for impact purposes. Nevertheless it fits well on the S5 and people who saw my phone mention how they like it. Now the design for the fit is okay. I said ok because where the flap is, you have some awkwardness with it to get the flap to open in o,order to be able to recharge the phone, but it was not a deal breaker. If you use the finger print setting, I had  to swipe slower than usual on it in order to complete the scanner because that are is slightly higher and gets in the way for faster fingerprint recognition. I hope this information helps. I recommend it despite these two minor adjustments."
"Works great, is the glass that the phone should have come with.  Resists fingerprints way more than the glass that comes on the phone.  Very easy to put on, just make sure that the glass is squeaky clean and that you align before touching it to the phone."
Great case so far. The yellow color adds just that little pop of color. Not a big fan of the strip next to the camera. Its like a shinny slippery texture unlike the rest of the case.<br />But still amazing. I would suggest to a friend if needed to.
The adhesive is not good. After first apply only 4/5 of the center area is well adhered.  All surrounding  perimeter around edges were slightly lifted up as if lacking of adhesive.
Item does not fit an Iphone 6 but does fit an Iphone 6 plus.  The web entry needs to be corrected as it appears it fits an Iphone 6 but it does not. The item is very nice had it fit.
"Like that it is a bumper guard only and that the front and back of the case are visible. Very snug fit. It might be difficult to remove easily. Looks great.  Charger plugs in no issue. Huge con: My Bose headphones don't fit completely into the jack due to the small opening. I connect most often with my bluetooth headphones, but when I fly I use my noise-canceling wired headphones which means I will need to remove the guard to use."
"I ordered these before purchasing  LG G4 Leatherback cell phones. Received them the same day we picked up the new phones. They are a perfect fit. Just what we needed, and wanted.  Getting them in two different colors allows us to distingush them from each other."
"This case broke the bottom glass panel on the rear of my phone.<br />When I went to put push the bottom of my phone into this case it cracked the glass on the bottom of my phone.  This case also scratched my phone all over the back.  Lastly the material that the use to make this case starts to wear out.  I had this case for only about two months and the material on the top of the power button started to wear out making the button hard to press, it also started tearing.  This case provides little to no protection."
omg words cant explain how good this charger is. Chargers my Nexus 6 to 100% in almost 30mins. Definitely would recommend this charger the Qualcomm 2.0 Quick Charge is definitely certified
Works better then the default battery that comes with the phone. It holds a charge far longer than the Samsung battery and it charges faster. I love it.
The case itself is great! But sadly the picture which is the whole point of getting a graphic case is extremely blur! You can actually see the giant pixels!
"Don't get this. It look like it have a hearing aid on, and I was talk this by a stranger lol"
My cell phone fits in perfectly easy to get in and out. product is as advertised. would recommend to anyone with a 5.5 inch cell phone.
"neat product,like the idea that it can charge Apple and Android products."
"This turned out to be a disappointment - we bought it and were initially pleased with how well it stuck to the windshield and positioned the phone - but 58 days after we ordered it, the plastic arm snapped and that was all she wrote. Can't be repaired - will have to be replaced. I know, I know, that's what you get for going cheap, but was really hoping it would last a bit longer."
"I ordered this product at the end of April,it's now almost September and I still haven't received it. Every time I contacted Mophie I got the run around. Finally cancelled my order today. Don't waste your time!"
"Great phone for the kids, however the upgradable to Android 5 is misleading - Blu, although initially promising an upgrade to Android 5 did not deliver."
Great emergency radio! It did give me a little of 'what is going on with this thing' after the second try. It started to blink and not run for a minute? I bought extra batteries. I only used it 30 minutes maximum on the original battery at full charge. Still trying this thing out. I just got it.
"This case is great for the LG G4.  The fit is perfect and it is easily removable/replaceable if you need to change the battery.  Plus, when doing so, you only need to remove the back and the screen protector is still locked in place nicely.  Prior to purchase, I was most concerned about the screen cover.  I wanted to protect my screen...but not detract from the usability.  The screen protector works great and lost very little sensitivity from a naked device.  I was surprised and impressed.  The G4 device has somewhat of a flaw in that it gets very warm and can overheat if on your dash for navigation and not near an air vent (even on a mildly hot day); however, I noticed no difference between the issue with the cover or with either of the other 2 backs I have (leather or plastic gray).  I was initially thinking a black case was not a good selection on my part, so you might want to consider that...but it seemed to be a phone issue and not a case issue since I saw the same problem with or without this case.  The screen protector is very easily wipeable and seems to show less fingerprints or has better visibility with fingerprints than the devices screen.  Oils from food or other will definitely show on the protector, but a quick wipe with anything available and they are gone.  Again, I think it is better than the native screen...and I was not particularly happy with the G4's screen visibility with fingerprints prior to owner this protector."
"Decent Product. Covers well, protection is great. Only problem was during application. Found it difficult, a few blisters still remain and couldn't be worked out even after watching tutorial videos."
I had to return it because the mute case switch did not connect properly to the phone mute switch.  It would work when first put in the case and would then disconnect.  I was bummed because the case was solid otherwise.
"I received the cable real fast, it worked fine initially. Then about 2 days later I couldn't charge my phone. After buying a new battery, the cable still wouldn't charge my android."
"I absolutely loved it! I use as a wallet im my big purse, and as know as I dont need everything I left there em car and catch just thir little one!"
No instructions and did not seal properly. More disappointed about NO instructions.
"I ordered it in a light pink, i like the case. A little bulky, but one think is that the slide thing is difficult to slide it open . I need a replacement ."
Bought 4 of them. 2 pink and 2 clear. They fit well and my wife did drop her phone it held up. The clear ones do start to get a green tint after 6 months. Great product for the price.
"Same original battery that came with the phone. Don't expect it to last longer, it's still cheap. The shipping and package came as expected, though."
"Loved this case on my HTC One and love it on my new Note 5 too. Great fit, protects camera well."
"Not the cleanest looking install, but for the price it's great.  Not sure if it's the roads around here, or my car, but once installed the detector rattled quite a bit. Hard plastic against the metal bracket made an incredibly annoying sound, but I fixed it by cutting a bit of bicycle inner tube and placed it between the detector and mounting bracket."
"I flew off a motorcycle, I had my phone in my back pocket, landed on my rear! Phone and case are still in perfect condition! Excellent case!"
Great case. Fits well around phone. Seems very durable.  Case holds 3-4 cards plus a little cash<br />Have been asked where disco get it by almost every cashier that sees me open it for the credit card
"Did not work well at all, wouldn't it get netfkixor music or YouTube it jsut buffering if stayed loading all the time was disappointed otherwise would be great product"
my cousin bought it he wanted to to take picture underwater while he is swimming this product will help him do that.
This is something ever girl needs especially the ones who hate carrying purses. The case is comfortable and very cushiony. It can only fit one credit card..two is a little hard to get out. Very cute case.<br /><br />I did receive this item in exchange for an unbiased review.
"I love this case, it's cute and convenient.  My phone and cards in one place.  I can just grab n go."
Bought it for my daughter.  Very functional and durable.
"These are great sounding bluetooth earbuds. NO these are not going to be beats ( i actually dont like beats so i think they do beat them myself) or bose but they sound really good and would easily be worth double the cost.<br /><br />These have the wings to really help to hold the earbuds in during activities. And i was glad to see that they include 3 different sized earbuds to find the perfect fit for you. I thought this was standard practice however have received a few that did not. And one size does not fit all. I also like the flat charging cable. More companies need to switch to this style as it helps keep the cables from becoming tangled, and thereby kinked to where they lay all over the counters looking terrible.<br /><br />Sound quality wise these deliver nice highs good mids and respectable bass, good for almost all types of base. And the battery life is very good allowing you to go farther and work longer without having to recharge.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone. You would be hard pressed to find an equal sound quality including bluetooth and a mic which makes crystal clear calls, and for the 17.00 price tag its a real steal.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review. MY ratings never remotely consider that factor, I rely to much on reviews from time to time when buying products to give something a positive rating because its free. However I do consider the list price on amazon for some items to keep it all in context. For instance, you shouldn't expect a BMW for the price of a Chevy.<br /><br />If this review helped you , please click on the little link below, so i know i am hitting the things you need to know and that my reviews are helping people.

"Have gone through a couple different brands of these, including the Apple brand, and found that they seldom last more than a few weeks before they stop working, sometimes within days. Granted, I have three young children using them with their iPads -- a rough proposition-- and Apple's poor design here is destined for destruction. However, we've been using two of this brand for more than two months now, and both are still functioning! Yippee."
Giving this four stars because except for the sink test (which it passed with flying colors) I have not used this this item as intended yet. Will update after vacation.
Purchased this as a backup power supply for traveling especially when I go camping or backpacking where I have no access to an external power source. While the device is a tad heavy for backpacking at 10.8 oz. it works incredibly well. The design is sturdy and elegant and also has a built in flashlight and comes with a cool travel pouch and 2 USB to Micro-USB charging cables. So far I have been very impressed with its performance which exceeds other charging external battery packs I've purchase.
"Swimmers, beachgoers, caught in the rain, doing sweaty things.…Truly waterproof. 15 bucks you can't beat it. I was a little skeptical about possible leakage, I can honestly say I am 100% secure that my phone is absolutely 100% dry. Also, I can still use my phone when it's in it and it fits in there with the OtterBox! Other products you have to take your phone out of the OtterBox.👎🏻I also just realized that having a waterproof phone means I can now take videos and pictures underwater… Awesome! I should also mention that the pictures did not come out looking like they're being taken through any kind of plastic filter… perfectly clear, as if your phone wasn't in this bag at all. A must have to protect your investment."
"Actually really nice, in my opinion. I have no complaints at all.<br />My orders came in earlier than I had expected."
"Changes color, begins to look dirty.  Fits phone exceptionally well."
I bought one of these.  Found out it doesn't fit in a life proof case. Too fat.  But I took my Dremel and sanded just a hair off both sides of the end that goes into phone. Fits perfectly. Works fine.
Not too difficult to replace the iPod battery. The battery works great. The tools were cheap as expected but the job was completed.
Great case but mine didn't include the kickstand??
I love it! It makes my phone so much bigger & heavier I love it like that and it also holds a charge for so long. Definitely worth buying.
"I got to say it's a really nice product. The screen is so clear it looks like it's part of the iPhone 6 screen.  The moment it came in I immediately went to the Verizon store for them to put it on my iPhone 6 & my wife's too. I was afraid to install it myself. If I have any issues I'll definitely update it later on. What I like about this product is that it has a lifetime warranty on it too. I've read from previous reviews that it's a tab smaller than the iPhone screen, which yes it is but I've an Otterbox Defender on it & it mostly covers the rest of the phone."
"It was great to salvage my phone after a severe break.  It was difficult and took several hours to complete the process, but I had heard that from other reviews.  If you are willing to put in the effort to save money, it's a good deal.<br /><br />My phone doesn't look and work perfectly.  I screwed up one of the lower buttons and you can see the tape around the edges, but for me it is worth it to put off buying a new phone for another year or two."
We've purchased other tablet mounts but none have felt as sturdy as this one.  Wish we had purchased this sooner...
"Piece of junk, did not work. Unfortunately I threw away all the packaging so I can't return it. Never had a problem with any of the hundreds of different cords I bought in the past. I mean it just a cord so it should work! No quality control?"
Fantastic. Wouldn't know it didn't belong on the dash in the first place. Holds great I have iPhone 6 sits on magnet and does not vibrate very strong. Also have Rokform Case but will work with any magnet type case.
Great charger. Bought one for the office and one for home. Makes it so much easier to charge our devices without fighting over outlets.  Delivery was super quick.
"Happy with purchase. The case fit great and has a good feel in my hand, kickstand is great, only thing bad maybe is for the s pen because case is a little thick there, so when you release pen it get even with case and have to grab at the edge of case where it's lower. Also it works with a wireless charger."
"Typical clear case.  Very slim and sleek.  Not hard, very pliable. Not really for those that tend to drop their phones a lot."
"Great case, exactly as described!  Will definitely buy again from this seller."
"Cool watch, does everything I would like it to do. Was a bit disappointed that there is no audible feedback, but I got use to it. One major problem is the material that this watch is made out of. After wearing this watch for a couple weeks it made my skin start to dry out and peel. It also discolored my skin. Try contacting pebble but I have yet to hear from them. Besides that it's a pretty cool watch. It also does scratch very easily."
"Very rugged and sturdy.  Recommended it you are hard on your phone.  It does add some bulk to the phone, but makes up for that in the added protection."
"Awesome case bag! On first receiving this products, I was scared and unsure whether to trust it or not. But inside, they gave a good idea to test it. You put a napkin or paper towel inside and put it under water. The paper towel came out perfectly dry. This pouch is great and works really well. I have used it in the pool with no problems at all.  When locking the case, it gives a tight close that you can feel while closing it. I have a s6 edge (5.1in) and that fits in with extra space available.<br /><br />It comes with a lanyard so you can hang it around your neck and also a floatable wrist band.<br /><br />To use this case it is pretty simple. All you do is slide your phone in and then turn the two locks into lock position. This case is IPX8 Certified which means it can withstand depth up to 60 feet (20 meters). Having this certification is very important and it basically means that it has been tested many times and has been put to its limits.<br /><br />This case is ideal for anyone. It can be used in the pool, at the beach, in the shower, waterparks, anything. And this isn't limited to phones. You can keep papers, cards anything that fits.<br /><br />Overall I am really satisfied with this case. It provides great protection against water and comes with handy extras. You can use both cameras and play your music because you can hear it through the case. This is a definite buy.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest."
"[[VIDEOID:6de0598074660ad8fa870661bf4ac30]] The Mpow iSnap does so many things for the monopod/selfie stick that range from aesthetics to grip to functionality, portability, and more. I say that having tested over 60 of these things in the last 2 years, so there is a lot to compare/contrast.<br /><br />With regard to aesthetics, this comes in a few different colors. I went with white because I enjoy the shade and because it matches my headphones I like to wear, and i have to say that it is nice to have something you can accessorize. The Mpow offers a rubberized body with form, which is something nice that deviates from the standard stick-like, plastic./metal designs. It adds grip as well, plus it provides a comfortable material that gives grip if your hands are wet/sweaty.<br /><br />I cover safety in the video, but I want to note that there are at least five elements here that add to safety, which in is essence protection for your expensive electronic device. This includes the grip design, the cradle locking, the cradle lip or incline, the wrist mounting strap, the quality of the design, and the quality of the locking screw. Each of these alone is an improvement on most designs, but together they make a great item.<br /><br />As far as portability is concerned, the Mpow gives up a nominal amount of extension for the ability to fit in a compact bag or pocket. When trying this design out, I kept sliding it in my pocket to see about functionality, and people noticed it. They remarked on how it seemed sleek and streamlined, plus it looked nice overall. The flipdown cradle is a nice design element, and the way it extents compliments this design-type more than your locking designs currently do.<br /><br />Considering the use-type, I like this with this type of stick. There are basically three types of these out there, with the remote control, the wire-in, and the button. The button allows one-handed use, which makes it superior in a lot of settings and especially with phone use. Were you out and wanting to take a picture of something you had in your hand, for example, a remote and a stick are too much but the one-button helps out. The wire-in; I do not like that design much so this does not really consider it.<br /><br />Using a selfie stick is simple: you charge it via USB plug, turn it on and your phone on for synching, place your phone in the cradle after it is synched, and switch to camera mode. Point the mode to yourself, extend to desired length, and hit the button. That's it.<br /><br />Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and was tested well before reviewing. Sampling helps with items like selfie sticks because it allows reviews to determine good brands and to test new features that may/may not work, and I really like this design.one use.

"I bought 2 cables, one for the office and one for the car. They work perfectly. My iPhone recognizes it as if it was an apple product. The cables also feel sturdy and of great quality. Only time will really say of this is the case, but so far so good. I would recommend this product. Even the packaging, which will go to the trash is of good quality."
"I am finally writing a review for the Elago G5 Flex cell phone case after using it for 2 years!  I have loved everything about this case, it's sleek design, the color, the feel of the case but most of all the protection that it has provided for my phone.  I have dropped my phone umpteen times and this case has ALWAYS protected my phone, the case has never come off nor has the screen been scratched (when I have dropped it).  The reason I am now writing the review is that my Samsung Galaxy phone battery is dying and I will be purchasing an iPhone.  I'm not a big fan of the 2 piece Elago iPhone design, but as I said, the G5 Flex Case has protected my phone so well that I think I am going to try out S6 Glide Case!"
"The micro-USB wore out after owning the product for 3 months.  It's a good product with the design sturdiness, but there are mixed reviews about the micro-USB wearing out soon as the 'teeth' will be shaved off early.  Recommend a different product.  Updaste:  CSR contacted me regarding the difficulties and replaced the product for free.  Certainly would give them a chance in the future if you have a defective product."
The protector is great. Looks just like the picture. The only downfall is it doesn't come with a screen protector/shield.
"The item came very quickly, however, the description was deceiving.  The item I bought was the Matte back ultra, but the material was not matte, it's more like a rubbery plastic."
Works as advertised. Will completely recharge my phone from as low as 5% (I haven't had to go lower yet!).
Why buy expensive earbuds if there's a nice and great quality cheap ones. Great product
"Great, solid case. Design stays true to contour on phone. Only cut out on back is for camera. Case has indented dimple so you can still have someplace to rest your finger to keep the phone snugly in your grasp. Would order again."
The battery I received is defective. I will save my review until I see how the seller handles the problem.
when arrived i made a test for every single cable and works well but after a week one of the cables damage and stopped working. It was very bad because i bought 3 cables cause i need it all of them
"I have a 2 year old who is always trying to grab my phone and this case has made it more substantial which I was wanting!  I love the look of it and it isn't slippery like another one I had.  I have a black phone but wanted a white one so I was happy this cover is white on the front.  I have had this a couple months and the design isn't fading at all.  The cover hasn't stopped the phone from reading my thumb print.  I did get a glass cover before I got this case and loved how easy it was to maneuver.  I didn't love the cover on this because I do have to touch it harder to type, etc.  I have debated taking it off since I have the glass cover but told myself to leave for a while to see if I could get used to it.  I want as much protection because of the 2 year old!  I am used to it enough now that I will leave it on at least until she is older.  I don't like that I can't pretty much at all be able to slide up to use the flashlight for example because of the ledge on the thumb reader and cover.  I still highly recommend it!!!!"
"Did not fit into my HTC Amaze, even though octane up in the search."
"Apparently, this is made for SMALLER smartphones, not like a Samsung Galaxy S3. My phone will not fit in this thing. I thought maybe it was because my phone was in a glove, but when I removed it from the glove, it STILL didn't fit. What a waste of money. Would probably cost more and take up wasted time trying to return this useless thing. Measurements were not provided in the ad. I AM NOT HAPPY!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0056C4VRK iStabilizer Mount Smartphone Tripod Mount]]"
"Love this case! Perfect combination of protection and sleek minimalist feel! Feels well made and can attest to true drop protection! Also fits the phone very well with no sagging at the edges! I'm one of those that obsessively researches before I buy and I can't brag enough on this case. Perfect for my needs. Plus love the appearance. Black is business safe, though the pattern sets it off! Feel like this is Batman's phone case - no not George Clooney Batman but Christian Bale Batman! Paid 7 bucks - would've gladly paid 3x that!!!"
Its paid for itself a couple times now.haha....... It probably has a lot more options -I don't have the time to slow down & read the instruction manual.<br />just kidding-well kind of........JaneB
"Very nice phone case, the color and design just as the describe that looks fashion. It fit my iPhone 6 very well, also it is light weight. I recommend it!!!"
It works. Never had any issues charging out of the 2 months I used it. Kinda bulky but for the price I guess you don't get the slimmest
"its a nice sturdy case, it feels like it protects the nexus 6 well, only wish the micro usb port opening was more accommodating for the oem usb cable. And also the power button isn't as clicky as the volume buttons."
Practically worthless despite the cheap cost--got nudged once (on the day of arrival) and it's been useless ever since.
"This case fits the Note 5 perfectly with a tight grip, 2 shell case gives the phone enough protection if you drop it. Doesn't make the phone bulky as from what I expected."
"Super easy to install... Took about 1 minute for each plug on the app. Loved how easily it integrated into my Amazon Echo. I can walk into my house with my hands full of groceries and say &#34;Alexa, turn lights on&#34; and all of the sudden be able to see. Great product!"
Love it. Take this on our camping trips and it charges my phone between 4 to 5 times throughout the weekend.
"Even though I hardly use the card slot on back, the case feels secure in the hand, slides easily into my holster, and feels like it gives solid protection (the inner rubber liner is great to have)."
The fashion of the case was nice and looked good. The case is not made for any type of protection.
Worked exactly as described husband uses on his phone. He is a mechanic and this is a phone life saver!
"Your selfie stick is incredible! I had purchased a separate one a week before purchasing the one from you. I decided to give the other one to a friend and kept this one. I love it! I really like the fact that I can take pictures by using the stick and I do not have to set the timer on the iPhone. The Bluetooth compatibility is a very easy set up. While the telescopic feature extends long enough to incorporate all of the things we would like to in the background, it is compact enough to throw into any of my handbags. I have used the selfie stick on vacations, at the beach and just around our city. It is a great way to also take photos over a ledge without getting to close! I have also used it during my son’s soccer games to capture video from above. Thanks for making it inexpensive too. With all of the features, I would expect for it to be a bit more costly-but thankful that it is not."
"Watch is ok for what it is kind of desgned to do - show time. The only thing is , the more display on, the less battery juice is left. For me the watch last a day-10 hr. The other thing is the software and not fully developed hardware when display lights up when not required. And remember display on- less working time left."
"Solid fit,delivery on time!!!!"
I use this item everyday for iPhones 5S and Orion Power Bank. Both items I've bought from Amazon and recommend for other Customers.<br />Mark B.
Good deal!  Great Colors.  Thank you so much!
Battery drains fast. The back side gets hot and cellphone runs too slow. It's rebooted by it's own sometimes. I want my money back.
"Battery-powered rechargers have become an essential item for many users of mobile devices. It's become a very competitive field with new brands and models popping up every month. The Intocircuit Power Castle 11,200mAh external battery pack is one of the newest entries in the crowded field, and based on my initial impressions, it looks like a formidable competitor. Physically, it's one of the larger (4.3&#34;x2.8&#34;x0.9&#34;) and heavier (9.8 ounces) rechargers that I've used, but it's not out of line with other units in the 11,000-12,000 mAh capacity range. And it's very solidly made, with a brushed aluminum case protecting the insides.<br /><br />As I would expect with 11,200mAH capacity, the device has two charging ports - one rated at 5 volts/2.1 amp maximum and the other at 5 volts/1.0 amp maximum. Both ports are labeled, although the labels are very difficult to read because of low contrast. The battery pack is recharged with the included power adapter that plugs into a wall outlet (note: the power adapter is unlabeled, but the product guide indicated that the output is 1-2 amps). The device can also be plugged into the USB port of a PC for recharging itself. An LCD panel displays the charging status of the unit. Very conveniently, the Power Castle automatically begins charging when a mobile device is plugged in, and it turns itself off when recharging is completed or when the mobile device is unplugged. It can also be turned on and off manually with a small button located next to the LCD display. There's also a built-in LED flashlight that's operated with the same button.<br /><br />I tested the Power Castle unit with three devices - a Samsung smartphone, an iPhone 4, and a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. I did not attempt to quantify the charging rate, but it had no problem recharging a smartphone and a tablet simultaneously. The Power Castle unit includes a set of adapter plugs that should fit almost all mobile devices, including Apple. The kit comes with a drawstring pouch to carry everything in.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed with the Power Castle Series PC11200. It appears to be a solidly-built, rugged unit for recharging mobile devices when a lot of capacity is needed. Unlike some brands of rechargers that skimp on things by omitting a wall charger and/or some adapter plugs, the Power Castle is complete with everything most users will need.<br /><br />A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for evaluation and review.ing pouch to carry everything in.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed with the Power Castle Series PC11200.

"I ordered this for my car (a 2006 Honda Accord) so that I could play music from my own phone, and didn't read the reviews before purchase. A lot of customers wrote about the frequency being crappy and static, so I tried cancelling my order before it came and I ordered a different product. I'm glad the cancellation didn't go through, because the other product I bought (an Ideashop High Quality Car MP3 FM Transmitter) was crap. The USB wouldn't charge my phone like it was supposed to and the quality wasn't too great. So I tried out this product in my car, and the USB worked perfectly and I found a non-static station within seconds. I am surprised at how well it worked compared to the other 5-starred $20 more expensive product.<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to jam out with windows down"
Awesome. Great product. Case fits well.
Sticks to device very well and easy to remove and comes with 4 pieces. Two small and two larger stickers.
Works great for my galaxy s5 and s6. Slightly longer charge time that wired charge but that goes for any wireless charger. Fast shipping.
"Beautiful case, came in perfect condition.<br />Was very hesitant about paying such a low price for a phone case. But was very surprised with the quality.<br />It is light, sleek, but feels firm and strong to the touch."
"Thin but strong case, the color is exactly like the website"
"Giving it 4 stars not because it's a bad product, as a matter of fact, I dropped my phone and it didn't break or Crack the screen.  But I am giving it 4 stars because it would have been nice if I would have known ahead of time that there was no screen cover with the outer case."
Shell case is quite durable.  Interior padding could be a bit thicker.  Just enough space for 2 extra pair of AA batteries.  Good price.
I do not recommend a product sold with the bad touch and was in very poor no more nothing to say I leave
the cases are so pretty! My friend loved them!! Definitely one of the best gifts I've ever given!
"great speakers for their price range. I have used boss speakers in several vehicles and projects, never been disappointed yet."
Case works well for me so far. No issues with it. This is a great product from a great seller. I'm overly impressed with this product.  I enjoyed testing out this product. This is a product that I'd gladly purchase again. I am a satisfied happy customer. I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.
"I have purchased many remote speaker/mic combos in my quest to find something that will work well AND sound good. This item and the BaoFeng QHM22 Platinum Series IP54 Rainproof Shoulder Speaker Mic are the only 2 out of 10 mics tested worth using. The outbound audio quality of the mic is the best of all I have tested. The speaker quality of the QHM22 is better than this speaker, but it's hardly fair dinging this item since the two are both head and shoulders above the rest. This item is worth the extra money.<br /><br />This item feels sturdy and the swiveling clip is outstanding."
"Disappointed that my credit card got hacked after buying this item.  This kind of soured me from buying from Amazon marketplace in the future.  Other than that, like the case fine."
"Slim, good grip, wrap around protection, different look than other cases."
"I really love this armband!  The strap stays tight enough without gouging your arm. Since the phone screen stays exposed without plastic over it, you can easily answer calls or change music while exercising. The case is very durable and I use it as my daily phone case!"
"We had a previous problem trying to find the right size cover for my husband's Acer Iconia. This one (for mine) came with the Acer and, of course, fits wonderfully. The fold over stand works well but will slide on slick surfaces because of the felt-like fabric on the cover.  Overall, I give it 5 Stars because of the design, excellent fit, and durability."
awesome<br />Great product<br />Protects the iPhone but keeps the iPhone in sight.<br />Love it
For years I have been using this product for a flip phone and trust me it worked VERY well -- Now i have gone to a smart phone and I have purchased 2 different types of the Nitelze Clip cases AND neither one work -- I really &#34;loved&#34; the aggressive clip --- Thus to say i am NOT SATISFIED
Don't buy it.  No privacy what so ever!!!!
"At first I received one that wasn't as large as it was suppose to be. It was suppose to be for an iPhone 6 Plus but it didn't fit. The armband company was awesome and sent me a new one right away when they saw they had made a mistake, and didn't make me send back the other. Good people."
I love this case! It's thin and sleek. Just what I was looking for for my iPhone 6. Both the camera and screen are protected by case and it has good grip. I also love that it shows off the body of the phone because it's crystal clear.
"Whenever he needs a bit more protection, this has become one of our teenage son's primary go-to cases.<br /><br />I can't figure out why this has received a couple lower rated reviews... it has a perfect fit for our iPhone 6 (4.7), including the cushioning inner liner, the tougher polycarbonate shell, and the interchangeable backs. We tried all three combinations without a single issue.<br /><br />Would recommend this case to anyone looking for multi-layer protection for their iPhone 6 (4.7), based on our experience with it.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
Just the right amount of bright for a nightlight. The changing/transitioning colors makes it that much better! The sensor at the bottom also works like a charm.
"The Moto G is nice phone when it works.  But do not expect Motorola to stand behind their claimed warranty.  On our phone the charging port quit working after 9 months.  We shipped it to Motorola per their instructions.  A month later they have still not repaired or replaced the phone, even after repeatedly contacting them.  Do a search and you will see many others that are having the same frustration with Motorola warranty problems."
The little paper tabs do not peel off properly. In the package I received none of the them peeled off correctly. I put in the trash. Waste of my money and not wasting more time trying to get a refund. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
"This was great for about a year.  The audio quality was good.  However, I did not receive a Belkin Brand, but a SCOSO4G.  The retractor spring broke during normal use and is now useless."
"Gave it to a friend, no instructions, no suggestions, no one to get advice from.  I'll let my friend wrestle with this instead."
Bought this case for my son to still be able to see the gold S6. He has already  dropped his phone and the case protected  it. He likes the slim design that it still can fit in his pocket. All buttons line up and are functional. You can charge while case in on. Only thing is the camera on back rests on the surface you place your phone on.
"Not sure what it does, didn't buy the right thing but I'm sure it does what it needs to do"
"I was searching for an alternative to the suction cup phone mount & this met my needs perfectly. It is easy to use & perfect for my daily commute. I tried other vent mounts, but they were cumbersome to use.  The magnet is strong & I am easily able to remove & position my phone each time I drive. You won't be disappointed in this product!"
did not fit the phone it was advertised for. actually fits a Samsung core duo so i had to buy it off the person it was purchased for.
Not bad I've heard better but I like the center control and volume button I use these all the time better than some not as good as others
"this is the best case iv had ever, i love it i still use it to this day, perfect for id, money and any cards you have, no issues with it falling apart, or anything, would buy again!"
Had this case for two weeks and loved it. Pulled it from my back pocket one day to find the plastic band had broken above the volume control buttons.
"Probably the best bit of travel gear I've ever bought. When my wife and I travel, between us we have at least 4 gizmos that need charging. Finding even two plug points is often a challenge. With this baby I need just one. Grab it."
"I love this fitness bracelet! It is very user friendly.  I find myself moving more to try and beat my number of steps from the day before. I am a teacher for young adults with special needs.  We use it to challenge each other to duels, track each others progress, and motivate and encourage each other.  My husband is marathon runner and now that he has seen how mine works, he is going to get one.  Great product!"
"It came in before scheduled and it is an awesome product!! I love the case; it protects my phone very well. If I drop it on the ground, the case pops open because it took all the impact, and my phone doesn't even turn off, let alone crack. And the design is perfect!! It looks exactly like I expected it to, and it's very detailed. I got tons of compliments on it. The screen protector is awesome too! It doesn't get fingerprints and really keeps the screen looking good as well as protecting it. The stylus is okay but too small, and the case opener is very useful when trying to get the case off because the case is on there really tight. Unless you want to break your nails, you'll want to use the case opener. All in all, love this product!!!"
"Works as advertised - but, it causes significant radio interference. If you use a two-way radio or listen to your FM radio, don't buy this one. This is a widespread problem with many automotive USB chargers. Poor design."
"Sleek, perfect fit,enhances the look of the phone."
A very good product. The only problem that I had was a firmware issue. When I couldn't get it to load they were very prompt with an exchange that works great. This is the folks to deal with for a dash cam
"seems pretty cool, no directions on where the stylus goes does not fit in the middle like the picture leads you to think but I figured it out otherwise worth the purchase"
Lovemit at first after a week or two it bubbled ans once i tried to rub my fonget to get the bubbles out it cracked. Very disapointed. Cant even find a web to try n go thru warranty. Smh we ordered 3 n 2 did the same.
"The blue takes on color real easily.  Example, dark jeans fade onto it, also any other dies pants or corduroys."
"Well the material is very good. This mount car fit very well the phone. The only thing, and i thought all this model is the same, is the back connector &#34;dance&#34; in the A/C window because no fit well on it"
Works better than th Oter Box.  No stretching and protected my phone when I accidentally dropped it.  No damage at all.
MagicMobil Great! Great price for 3x batteries with wall charger &  exras for my Samsung Galaxy S4! Been having problems with phone battery constantly draining! Having 3 batteries I can carry with me so I can change them! Doesn't solve what the problem is with this phone as I've read many customer reviews bout their battery constantly draining!  Worth the money! You'll like havin extra batteries with you! So far battery holdin its charge! :)
"A very nice product.  Well packaged.  Compact design, can slip into any pocket, and since it is a cylinder shape, no gouging from 90 degree corners.  Easy to operate, instruction are clear and to the point.<br />Charges my iPhone as any charger should.  Flashlight is a nice touch.<br /><br />Get it."
"They are a little short, but the kids like them. They are perfect for the charging station I've set up in their room. Acts as a nightlight too!"
Awesome.  Magpul is the way to go IMO!
"Design wise this case is spot on. Fits like a glove and looks like a million bucks. Enough protection without being too obtrusive.<br /><br />My issues with this case is the backing material.  While super stylish and sharp,  the lines makes the surface too slippery, specially for single hand operations. The other thing that bothered me a little was the width of the case. Due to the outer ring,  the phone is several millimeters wider...which can take a large phone from comfortable to just too big.<br /><br />On looks it takes the 5 stars hands down,  but design  of the case makes me more likely to drop it than without.  It's going back to vendor."
"I received this as a free review sample. Before proceeding I want to point out two things to set expectations: (1) the solar panel is for secondary charging, and (2) the rated storage capacity and effective capacity are two different factors.<br /><br />The USB charging port is intended to  be the primary mode of charging the battery in this unit. The solar panel cells are only for emergency or when you are off the grid.<br /><br />While this unit will, in fact, charge up to and store a full 8000mAh of power, you can only realistically expect 5600mAh of actual charging from it.  charging from it.  All batteries using li-polymer technology, regardless of brand, will experience this level of loss. That is how these batteries work. They can store up to the rated capacity, but you lose a full 30% during the charging process (16% from heat and conversion and 14% from cable inefficiencies).<br /><br />I've been using this since January 2015 (nearly nine months) and have considerable experience with it. Know that for the solar charging it takes nearly a summer's week worth of sunny days to fully charge the battery from near zero to full, so that is another reason why the solar part is a secondary means of charging. If you are camping or just off the grid, the solar panel is a great way to build up power for emergencies. That assumes that you will use this battery as an emergency-only back-up and otherwise conserve power on your phone.  For regular use, especially at the beach, this is an ideal way to trickle charge the battery while away from power sources or extend the use time on a speaker, phone or even small tablet. Do be aware that when depending on solar charging, it will not keep up with the consumption of your device.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you intend to charge this using conventional wall or vehicle chargers, the solar panel is an added bonus and the useable capacity of the battery (5600mAh) is a lot of reserve power.<br /><br />My high rating is based in comparing this to a number of similar solar backups. This one is well constructed, compares well against the others and is super reliable.in comparing this to a number of similar solar backups. This one is well constructed, compares well against the others and is super reliable."
A great replacement for a seldom used home line. It would be nice if cellular data included caller name.
"This product is really good for gym, holding well in ears. I am wearing glasses. This design makes me comfortable with headsets and glasses at the same time."
"This unit was to be used to hold my iPhone while doing Periscope presentations (live streaming video). It holds the iPhone nice and tight, but the wobble in the cable makes it a poor choice for this purpose since the iPhone will move and continue to wobble for some time after being bumped. In other words, if I bump the desk this is clamped to, the iPhone will wobble and keep wobbling for a time, making it seem as if I'm shooting during an earthquake. For other uses, this is likely a fine choice. It's well made and will last."
"I would not recommend this case to any one. Have have to take the case off just to charge your damn phone. Spend the extra money and just buy the screen protectors, thats the grab. Very disappointed"
Great phone case for the money. You have the option of using the bumper gaurd without the exoskelton. I like it because it does not have the plastic screen protector like the other brands. I personally like being able to swipe on directly on the phone.
"Good case and cover, white gets dirty so fast, was my bad decision. Otherwise works well except the left middle latch on mine moves a lot so I hope the doesn't create a problem, also back latch is tight so I was afraid to break it, so far no problem."
"This was a great case and it protected my phone through many MANY bad falls. It is chunky which is something you have to deal with if you want a safe case. It's actually good looking too. Not a half bad case. The only problem I have with it is why the chose to make the outer shell soft, and the inner shell hard? Because of this my phone has many tiny grey scratches on the back and the sides. Every time I've dropped it, the hardness of the case did some damage to the color and removed little pieces of it. Most cases are soft on the inside for this very reason. This technique did not make sense to me.<br />The case did its job to protect my screen, but it could have prevented the scratched everywhere else."
I bought these for the fact they where VERY cheap and they had great reviews. so i bought them first i noticed they where super comfy and I could not complain about that but about owning them now for 2 months i noticed the red material inside the headphones is beginning to fall out and I use these a lot for when i go walking now i mean for retail these go for $90.00 so i was kinda shocked at how they just fell apart like that. Another thing I noticed after a Week or so of owning these the AUX cable they come with is VERY Cheaply designed and after 2 weeks stopped working so I don't know if it's from Cheap design or just heavy usage but i don't think i'd ever buy these again
"Here's the real scoop. the Topo 24k maps are great and work good, it's the basecamp software from garmin that's lousy.  Basecamp is awkward and poor.  Garmin has usually great products, but their basecamp software is a real disappointment."
I bought this case for my mom and she loves it but after a while the kick stand will break so recommended not using ....
"My wife loves the case, she has only dropped it once and there is not a scratch or dent on it. The color scheme, she really likes. The  kickstand feature she uses and states that it is very useful. Would recommend it to everyone who wants to protect their phone."
Exact Match. Excellent communication with Seller.  Thumbs up.  All Around !!!!!
"I needed some headphones for my daughter to bring to school, so I wanted to find some that were nice and would fit well, but weren't so expensive that steam would come out of my ears if (when) she lost them. These fit the bill perfectly. Nice sound, they fit well, and work perfectly with her phone (home use) and chromebook (school use). The only con is the fact that the squishy ear pieces don't always stay on very well, and I am worried they will fall off and she won't notice until it is too late. I did recieve this product at a discount for an unbiased and honest review, which I have given here."
"To be clear, the transaction was just fine, this is about the quality of the product.  It would be much better if there was a way for the opening to not be so large.  This would  require either a very elastic material or some way to &#34;cinch&#34; the ends once it is on the product.  I ended up using electrical tape but this looked a bit trashy...I am not using the product at this point."
"Got this speaker tonight and I'm amazed at how awesome the sound is, did some serious research before I decided on what one to purchase and I made the right decision with this bad boy! The sound is amazing and the 3D option really makes a difference that I didn't think I'd notice. I would reccomend this 100%"
"Still adapting to the phone, but all and all I love this much better than the other name brand phone."
Great phone case! Came in on time. The back stand does come undone after some use. I have dropped the phone in the case and no damage! Durable!
can't get the pins out ....... what a waste of time and money ...... NO DIRECTIONS!  ....... smh!
Don't buy this item! I dropped my phone recently and it went through the screen and broke my phone screen!
Great item came day earlier than what was suppose to fits very snug charges fast very reliable will buy again if I need to
Rapid-charge allows me to use my GPS/Navigation (Waze) without drawing down the battery.  Previous OEM charger could not keep up with the drawdown when using Waze in the vehicle.
It works well enough except that the earbuds don't always stay in well. This can be a pretty big annoyance when you're running. I find that I'm often forced to adjust them while working out so that they stay in.
Love the size of these bows and can't beat the price but my 11 month old easily pulls the bows off then unravels the whole bow with ease by pulling on the loose end.  Obviously they are not sewn together.
"The sound isn't clear, always have a noise in the right earbud.....is too short bluetooth distance....and the microphone no works ...."
Too heavy
"Great phone! Fast, responsive and easy to operate. Battery life is good, it lasts me for at least 24 hours with one charge. I've been having it for two weeks now and I have no problem with it so far."
"These Cootree headphones have served as my go-to pair of head phones since they arrived in the mail. I am very thankful for the microphone placed about 6 inches down the right ear bud cord. Unlike models I have owned before, these headphones are great for phone conversations. Additionally, there is a button on the microphone piece that can be pressed to use siri, pause music, or fast forward music. The earbuds are best when they fit snugly inside your ear, and I've found the different size rubber ear pieces to be very handy.<br /><br />The cord is an ample length to reach your ears when your device is in your pocket. I like the design of the cord; it is flat rather than circular. The auxiliary input also works well when my phone is in its case, which isn't always possible with other head phones. The sound quality is great considering the price. The only drawback of the seal between the rubber ear piece and your ear is that any jostling with the cord will be amplified and sound noisy."
"I am desapointed. It becomes quickly dirty, you need to wash it often."
I can't stand having a phone without a qwerty keyboard and this is the ticket. I love this phone so much -( I had a Droid 3 for about 5 years or more until it wouldn't dial anymore) I bought another one! I want to make sure I have a back up in case this one lasts as long and they only have touch phones available. Touch phones are OK but I can out type anyone on a keyboard hands down. Touch phones are annoying and it's hunt and peck to me compared to flying on a keyboard.
"The photo is a little deceptive.  The photo seems to show the case going on the front of the phone, which is not accurate."
"I enjoy this case! I'm a person who has gone through plenty of cases and causing my phones to break. Yet, this one is amazing! And recommend it to anyone.<br />Just a small detail it is difficult to take the case off so be careful!"
"I bought this for my Samsung Legend. Seems durable but when I first opened the case, part of the corner clip fell off so my phone wiggles a bit. It also started showing stress marks on the stand arm after only a couple uses. Possibly because of the broken clip, the buttons are difficult to push when using this case."
"Picture quality is great on my Panasonic Viera 47&#34;.  I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4. The reason for the 3 stars is because it will not charge my phone while watching movies etc. So perhaps it's my phone or the Rankie cable, not sure. Also since you only have 6' of cable you might want to get a HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable to have more options for placement. I placed my phone on an end table next to my recliner and a outlet."
Worthless pile of garbage. Labels claiming Iphone/Ipad  compatible. It is not Does not work on either my Ipad mini or the Iphone 6+.My Iphone does not charge with the cable. The IPad Mini charges so slow it would take a week. It was not just one cable I ordered 2 of these and they both failed. Up date I retract my statement. I would seem there was a software update now the Iphone 6 works and the Ipad mini 1 and 4 that we have work fine now.This works great now. Therefore I stand corrected.
"Delivered quickly, very nice packaging too. I bought two so I'd have a backup. My first one lasted a long time until the day it slid off a stone wall.  It cracked but definitely protected by phone.  I had no problem putting it on- clean the screen well and drop down carefully and almost no bubbles to get rid of."
Terrible case because the cards won't come out!  I have owned other wallet cases and did not have trouble. Do not buy this case!  Spend a little more and get one that will hold 3 cards.
I have used it for about three weeks and it works fine.
"Good wallet/phone case. Works well, but I wish the clip was a bit stronger or could be used as a phone stand."
Very nice product. Fits the phone perfectly and provides excellent protection. Textured plastic and silicone rubber give the case good grip. All the features of a $60 case.
Worked good the first months but now  the Bluetooth is not working anymore so am using the sd card to play my music sometimes can't read that either also the gps got frozen :/
"Put my $400 smart phone in this holder on my dashboard, propped up in the grooves as shown in the picture, so i could use it for navigation.  first left hand turn i made, the phone flew to the side of the car, bounced off the door and almost went straight out the open window... am not sure, but I think that is not supposed to be how this works..."
"Horrible , it came with one of the connectors<br />broken which made the phone malfunction,so I had to put the old port back."
I love being able to lay my phone on this while at my desk and Maintain a charge all day.
Hooked up professionally works good no complaints on install Bluetooth easy. Plays DVDs great. My only disappointed part is I thought when u pull the screen off that it would still play by charge for the back seat but it don't it jst shuts off but still great product
I bought these hoping to split a signal for a monitor but they did not work.  They seem very flimsy and just did not work for my application.
"Looks like someone scanned a low-res image and had it printed on a very thin cheap plastic.  Case came cracked, unusable.  Bought it for my son, a huge Game Boy fan.  He even laughed at it when he opened it."
This iPhone 6 case is awesome. I love it its great protection for your phone also is really easy to put on your phone and it come with a nice stand. I really  recommend this product to other people. You will not be disappointed and its really light too. I put it to a test i drop it and it protected the phone real good. This is my own experience you may experience different.  *I purchased this item on a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.*
"These earphones are pretty awesome! First off they are orange and I love that! They're great for exercise, some of my favorite features are the fact that the ear hooks are very sturdy, and they are sweat resistant. It has an included microphone so taking calls is super easy while you're working out. They plug right into your phone, and not only do they work on my android phone, it is also iPhone and iPod compatible.The sound quality is excellent! I have used these working out for a few days and I absolutely love them I expect they will last a very long time.<br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
First off the screen does not fit properly; I can see light peeking out of the border of the screen. My screen goes haywire and starts opening apps and pressing random buttons making it impossible to use. the color quality was bad; it was oversaturated and darker than the official sony screen. AND there was an ugly black strip over the logo which couldnt come off. I now have to get a new screen and you can bet your a&#62;&#62; it wont be from these guys!!!! SMFH
Cable only worked 2 days!!!<br />The outlet plug is good and the car plug works off and on!!! Love the length of the cable!!!
"Pros:  6 ft of braided cord,  bright colorful design easy to find<br />Cons:  3 out of 5 of them stopped working on my iphone 4 after a few months probably due to too much wear and tear in the car and connectors became loose."
"DO NOT BUY THIS MOUNT. I bought this mount for my husband for his birthday in May. Less than 4 months of riding and ZERO crashes or drops of the bike, the mount snapped off during his ride in the middle of the street and damaged his new $700 cell phone he just purchased a week prior. He didn't even hit a bump! I SAY AGAIN, DO NOT BUY THIS DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. You'll end up damaging your phone and buying a new mount anyway."
"This plug is not 6ft long but it's still great if you just want it mounted to your dash near your radio, plus I don't know about other jeep models but if you have a model similar to the 2003 TJ wrangler it will fit right in the dash switch mount like this!"
"I have been using my AERO ARMOR Motorola Moto G Case for many months.  It still looks great.  It is durable and has protected my phone many times.  The case can be easily removed.  The different textures at various points were well thought out.  The case is easy to grip, slip resistant, and gently bounces when dropped on the ends/corners.  The color is as advertised."
Battery works as it should. It is nice to have my phone work properly again and the battery actually hold a charge. Got the battery quickly and at a great price.
"Purchased 2 packs of two of these in early June. By the end of August 2nd, less than 2 months later, one has already failed and the return policy does not provide for replacementnt after this short period of time. Will definatley not purchase an Anker product again. Will look for a higher quality product and update this review with the results of my search.<br /><br />Ankor contacted me and offered a replacement cable. It worked fine with my iPad Air but showed -accessory might not be compatible with this device on my iPhone 6+ and would not cha it. They are sending me another replacement. Good customer service but I am not sold on product quality yet."
"did the tissue paper test and passed! just bought a second one for my husband and we will take these with us to our Orlando, Florida trip that is coming up! can't wait!...........OKAY so my husband and I used these at Universal Orlando and on our trip to the beach. THEY WORKED AWESOME i had mine on all the water rides and in the ocean taking video of us jumping waves and under water and our phones were completely dry! love this purchase! I prefer this over a fitted water proof case cause we put our money and cards in here also and it was perfect to just have to carry this around Universal Studios."
Great product. My boyfriend works in a job where it is very easy for him to damage his phone. This case has allowed his iphone to sustain it's fair share of dangerous falls.
great headset im a locksmith and im driving a lot  and get a lot of work over the phone so with this im able to work and answer talk on the phone at the same time or answer while im driving it also plays messages from my phone it's a great headset the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's a bit bassy other than that its great great battery life  and clear audio. I recommend this product.
This system is great and it works well in My Toyota Sequoia Limited Edition. It fits perfectly and the wiring harness I bought with it makes the hook up a whole lot easier. It powers my speakers just fine without any issues.
"Item was exactly as described. Good Quality, super fast shipping and very friendly customer service! I highly recommend this case, very durable! I love it!!"
"Great cover, fits perfectly, excellent value"
I was super excited for this product but when I received it one of the lenses wa broken. At first I thought I wasn't placing it right on the phone but turned out there was a crack. I can only use the micro lense and wide eye. I hardly even use the micro lenses.
"Having read great reviews regarding how well this case protect phones from drops I decided to give it a try.<br />The case indeed does protect the phone from drops as I have test many times on accident.  The case fits snugly around my phone without adding excessive bulk.<br /><br />My only gripes with the case are:<br />-Not a big fan of the feel of the case.  The case has a soft feel and I was more hoping for a hard case.  Gives phone plenty of grip though.<br />-Ear phone opening is decent sized but if you have a larger plug it will not fit.<br /><br />Overall great case if you are looking for protection.  If you're looking for a fashion phone or wishes to use it with an more expensive pair of IEMs with a larger plug, this may not be your case."
Damn!!!<br />This is a super nice band. Feels the same as the one from Apple. Extremely strong magnet. Lugs are sturdy and fit well. I have small writs and most other bands make me feel like a 6 year old trying to my Dad's watch. Not the case here. Silver band with Space Grey looks saucey. 4th band I've purchased for watch. My favorite by far.
"Let me begin by saying I was offered an opportunity to have this charger sent to me free in hopes that I would write an unbiased review. I agreed to do so. When the charger failed after just a couple days use, I felt very uncomfortable: I didn't want to hurt the company that was nice enough to send me the charger for free, but on the other hand, I had a responsibility to write an accurate review (which I am doing now). I contacted the company and told them that the charger had failed. They were very apologetic while seeming to be in genuine disbelief, and they suggested I plug it in elsewhere and offered some other suggestions that I had already tried on my own. They then agreed to send me a replacement which I received promptly. They apologized for the inconvenience (there was no inconvenience for me at all). The replacement charger has been plugged in continuously now for about 10 days and has worked perfectly. It feels very solid and well built. It's compact and comes with a long cord (about 5 1/4 feet long), probably longer than necessary, but I appreciate it when a device comes with a longer, rather than a short, cord. There is a tiny LED light that lights up pale green when it's plugged in and working, which I find useful. My devices are charged quickly and completely. I have purchased many electronic (and other) items from Amazon, with a small percentage failing very quickly. Like the Omaker people told me (which I already knew), sometimes there's just a defective item among all the good ones. So I don't want to hold it against them that the first one didn't work. In looking at other reviews for this charger I see that my first one was not the only one that failed, but the failure rate is extremely low, probably lower than for most electronic items (but I'm not totally sure of this). Long before I was given this offer of a free item in return for a review, I had made other purchases from Omaker and for various reasons I had contacted customer service. Their customer service has always been terrific, and I mean 100% of the time. Very polite, very eager to help out, more than happy to provide information, etc. They have a great attitude, they are knowledgeable, and best of all, they resolve the issues the way we wish every company would resolve the issues. So I highly recommend this item, and if by chance you're one of the very few that were to get a defective item, don't sweat it. Just contact Omaker and they'll take real good care of you. Chances are excellent, however, that you won't have to bother, because I believe Omaker offers outstanding products."
"Love the sturdiness & protection. I've dropped my phone a couple of times now (even on a tile floor) & it has protected it. No crackled screen! Woohoo! The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 is because there were not enough color choices. I'd love a purple & teal or cobalt blue & lime green cover. Other than that, it's the best mobile phone protective cover available & I've tried several."
Haven't even had it a month and the headphones won't charge anymore.  Waste of money
Great connecting cord for my Apple IPad.<br />Next time I would get their 10ft cord.
"Love the look and feel...but is always showing fingerprints. I have had it on for a few days now, and the case is starting to look &#34;yellow&#34;. You failed on this Spigen. No grip, and terrible smudge marks everywhere."
I like the idea of having both my key cards and the phone together. Problem is that I have bought 3 of these and each one has a major flaw. The thin plastic on the upper side of the  volume keeps breaking off. My last purchase was last May and that one broke in less than 2 months. You cannot return this product if it is over 30 days.
This is a nice case.  It has held up well and has all of the slots in the right place and just the right size.  I've dropped my phone a couple times and it has been fine.  The color is more pink than purple.
"I bought 2 of these. One storm and one champagne. Both of them worked through the original battery and then no more. I've had Fitbits, Misfits, Peak Basis, and Garmins.<br />The Shines were the most stylish, but the biggest waste of money."
"The music played through the Aux cord wasn't &#34;High Quality&#34; but it was enough to satisfy me. The USB was what I had a problem with- it didn't charge my iPhone, which was one of the main reasons I wanted a product like this in the first place, so that was disappointing. Also, the remote did not work for me, but that may have just been a lack of tech-experience on my part. The buttons on the screen did not work for me either like I thought they would, so I'm guessing they are only functional if you have an SD card in, which I do not have.<br />Overall, this product was disappointing, and I am much happier with my Pyle PLMP2A FM Radio Trasmitter that I bought."
"Great case, easy to install, gives otter box run for the money!"
Otterbox quality at a quarter of the price.  Totally with the money
"Good case. Looks great but not much protection, husband likes it."
I really like the case and it seems to be well made.
Sturdy little case and I love the design.
"These are seriously awesome for the price! They were really well, just make sure you use the correct size buds or it will drive you nuts! It has an incredible Bluetooth range. I was probably 50 feet from my phone and it still had great music quality."
Well my friend bought me this case for my birthday and it took about two months for it to arrive but at the end it was worth it😊 I love the soft rubber material. It is super easy to slide on but still holds your phone. Has a little creece next to the screen so when it falls down the screen wont touch the floor. Everybody in school loved what it said and the color combination. Looks like it was alot of bucks but super cheap.💲
"After two week using the phone , the software don't Run and i can not find how to reinstaling , so disapointed about it , i wasted my money"
Love this case! Looks great on my white phone! Lots of compliments!
Bought 1 for my son's phone to check out. I was worried the touch screen would be sluggish with the glass over glass. The phone worked great and I bought another a week later for myself.
Worked great and fast.. charged both mine and my friend's phone on a night out.  They were pretty much dead and got us charged up to about 75 percent in less than an hour for both.  The only downside is bulkyness of the product.. but for the price I paid and the results I got its definitely worth it!
Great product. Just drop my phone and tablet on it and never have a problem making sure that they are on the sweet spot.
"I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />It arrived in easy to follow, easy to open packaging. When opened, it was half charged and charged to 100% in around 45 minutes. It has a rugged rubber design to aid with shock impact and rubber covers to seal the charging ports when not in use. It charged a Galaxy S5 to 100% with a little more power in the battery. The led light on the side can prove to be very useful in situations when you don't have a light handy. Overall, this product works as expected and is great for the price!"
"I love this bike mount! Plain and simple as that.  I don't have to take my phone out of its case like I have had to do with every other phone holder ( in car navigation, arm band for running, etc), such a pain but not with this universal mount from Vibrelli!  Easily attached to my bike in seconds.  I've ridden three long rides with it my phone is safe & secure.  I like what they've done.  Hope they make something similar for my car!!"
"I really got excited when I first heard about google cardboard.  The first box we got was a cardboard one that was cool but kind of loose.  The cool part about this product is that the phone holder is adjustable so with our 3 different sized phones we can all use the same box.  If you haven't tried Google Cardboard you need to.  I would get this box simply because it fits all phones, but its also better in a lot of ways.  For one its plastic so more durable.  The headband is also a plus, because its a 3 way strap so it fits better than most.  This is actually important because you are looking around a lot and want it to stay placed.  The strap on my box made from cardboard is small and only one strap so it comes undone.  Great buy"
"Fits Droid turbo very well. It is durable and has an attractive design, I opted for the pink which is so pretty!! The stand on it is so cool. My daughter can now watch movies on my phone without having to actually hold it.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"
Wonderful customer service! Great product.
This case was okay. It lasted about 5 months and the color started to fade and peel away.
"this is really a great mount. if you use your phone as navigator or music player this will be great in car as you can mount it on the steering wheel, phone won't slip if you turn"
"Piece of junk, dropped phone and it cracked the screen. Go with grip max case from Belkin and not this one"
I'm very impressed! It even holds an Otterbox case!
Great protector!
"Not at all impressed with the distance on these radio...which was a surprise to me because 1.) They are midland product and I was expecting better performance... 2.) They claim these radios are 30 mile. I know that's under perfect conditions, but they barely communicated 3 or 4 blocks.<br /><br />If you are looking for distance...I would recommend that you spend some extra $$$ and buy a baofeng.<br /><br />However, everything else is ok enough."
Very good quality case. It was exactly what I was looking for. Very fast shipping!
My phone doesn't  fit into case. The case is bigger than my phone.
I've had the elephant case for 4 months it looks like new still has really been able to protect my phone from a couple of drops! Always get compliments on it. It doesn't have the magnet but honestly the cover stays closed without it.<br />Loved my product!
Works great and charges my mobile phone rathee quickly. Stores enough energy for at least 2 charges throughout a single day if your phone's battery is low.
My go nokia go phone 520 finally broke:( I loved that phone and had a hard time replacing it.  I have bought 5 phones in the past few months and hated them all.....returned them after the first hour of fighting with them.  I just go this yesterday. First...the screen is big!  clear and amazing.  It has all the functions of my old phone but 10 steps up.  I love this phone. the camera pictures are  awesome!  I took a pic of my daughter outside and it's so clear I can see the sun rays.  I took one last night in the dark....still clear!  I wish there were more stars....for the price this is an amaazing phone!  Microsoft got this one right!
"For charging it's awesome, but it takes a long time for the first full charge.  Just plug it up and let charge all night.<br /><br />i wish the front of the case was thicker to provide a &#34; buffer&#34; for the screen when dropped.  Also the case is slick, so it's always sliding in the car.  I would like a rubber back or a rubber strip,  something to keep it from sliding.  Also the case is heavy,  I didn't weigh it but I'm guessing it's three or four times heavier than a I phone 6.<br /><br />I dropped mine and broke the top,  Customer service has been awesome so far.<br />I would buy this product again. I've gone up to 20 hours before with out having to worry about getting a charge.<br /><br />I simply leave in the am with phone charged, when the phone get down to say 10-15%,  I flip the switch and it goes back to a full charge"
"I'm in my car a lot.  Whether I want to be or not.  I have to travel a good distance to arrive at my office (then I repeat that same trip home everyday).  Not only is it a long drive, by I live in area in the United States that also has millions of people living in my area (specifically the roads that I travel everyday).  So there’s always a ton of traffic jams. Now, at least in the United States, most states have laws in which that you cannot be on your cell phone while you're driving.<br /><br />Now my car has Bluetooth technology (like most automobiles have these days).  In some automobiles you can actually have the car read your text messages back to you.<br /><br />However, there are times when you need to get on your phone for directions and other things. Even though your car may have Bluetooth technology, trust me if a cop see's you on your phone, for whatever reason (valid or not), that cop is going to pull you over and give you a ticket.  Of course if you get a ticket, it’s going to cost you money and more than likely your automobile insurance will go up.<br /><br />TechMatte has a remedy for that situation with the TechMatte MagGrip Vent Universal Car Mount it sells.  Now this MagGrip Vent Car Mount is a super sturdy (plus it's cradle-less), in which it holds the MagGrip Vent in place.  Not just does it hold it in place, but it is simple to install in your car.  TechMatte makes products that are focused on simplicity.<br /><br />All that you have to do is place the included slim, MagGrip plate inside the case of your device and attach the tiny, MagGrip magnetic clip to your car's air vent. The incredibly strong magnet will ensure that your device is secure.  With the cradle-less feature, it will enable you look at your device without any distractions.<br /><br />This is a great product because it's so simple to install and use.  Plus it will save you money. How?  Well, because a cop will not pull you over and give you a ticket for looking down at your phone or smart device. Truly TechMatte designed the MagGrip Vent Universal Car Mount with us (drivers) in mind.<br /><br />If you have a cell phone and you own a car, this is a must buy product.  I've done business in the past with TechMatte, so I knew when I ordered and received this MagGrip Vent Universal Car Mount, that I would be getting a very quality product that works.phone or smart device.

"Been very happy with this case, having the extra cord on board has been beyond helpful.  One less thing to have to worry about carrying around.  Best part is I received a discount on my order for a fair review."
Small and charges itself fast. I wish it charged my phone as fast but it still does a great job.
Wanted to return but the shipping cost of return was almost as much as cost of the case.
"it's not perfect, but it works well, does the job and i dont have to put my phone in the drink holder anymore.  the negative is that you cannot turn the device enough to be centered if you face-time someone (at least not in my acura).  but, maybe people shouldnt be face-timing while driving anyway."
"Seller: 5 Stars Product Quality: 4 Stars  I have a love-hate relationship with my S6 Edge...I love the way the edges look! it looks so majestic and unique. But I hate the fact all accessories are limited, like there are not solid protective cases and the screen protectors are not good. So next time I'll definitely choose a regular screen Galaxy."
Quick delivery.  Product was exactly as expected.
"Great, incredibly sturdy case. Only problem I have is that it is a little hard to plug in the charger. But I will buy this case again for future phones."
Thank you my husband loves cell phone case. Great quality
Good case
This is my second case of this brand. I find it's good quality for the price.
Thank you it is great product!!
Great!!!
"I followed the instructions perfectly (even down to running the shower a minutes before trying to install the protector, and the glass went on perfectly.  You wouldn't even know I had a protective glass over the actual screen just by looking at it.  I only had 2 bubbles under the glass, but I was able to smooth them out within a few minutes.  This is only the 2nd time I've tried to put on a protective glass over a cell phone screen (the 1st time ended horribly so I started just getting the company I buy the phone from to put one on for me), and it wasn't all that different, and like I said, the protective glass fits perfectly.  This product is definitely worth the money."
"You have to take the case off of the phone to fit it into the armband, that being said it's a tight seal once the phone is in which is nice."
"I really like the case. I just wish it wasn't all smooth plastic. I leave my house all the time with just my phone, so now when I grab it I have my ID and credit card as well. It holds 3 cards and a folded bill fine. Every once in a while the cards will get pushed out when you close if they are not seated in there right, but I know to check it now first. It is a little hard to open sometimes, but it isn't anything I struggle with. It is a little deeper than other cases I have, but I wouldn't say it is awkwardly bulky or anything. My only complaint about the case is the material. . I keep it in my back pocket of my jeans all the time, but remove it when I sit. When I first got this, it felt less sturdy than my Otterbox Defender case that I had previously on my phone.This one is much slicker material than the Defender. I wish at least part of the outside part of the case had the same material as the Defender does. I just feel like it is going to slip out of my hand. The defender was n... Read more"
"I love this case! Very convienant to carry around my cards, license, and phone.  Might be a good idea to have a screen protector, just to keep scratches away. (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.)"
Great concept but have to be very careful unwinding and winding. I've had to untangle a few times but it does serve the purpose of keeping long wires out if the way.
This product description and packaging clearly states that it fits an iPhone 5. It does not. You can see from my attached photo how much excess width and height remains for your phone to flop around inside the case offering less protection and potential for the phone to push up against the magnetic top and fall out. I was hoping this would have been of the same quality as another brand I purchased in the past but was disappointed.
"Definitely the best phone for the budget, I'm very happy with it!!"
"I have had it for about a month and it is working well. I do recommend this case,"
My husband loved this case as it didn't make his phone bulky as most other cases do. The case fit his phone perfectly and working in the landscaping business it provided the extra protection his phone needed to keep the dust out.
"Worked as described.....charging is quick and easy...just place and go...I have the galaxy 6 and the quick charger is faster but ease of use counts  for something...I rated it 4 instead of 5 because i had one situation where i left it on the charger overnight where i thought it overheated my phone and drained the battery...not sure if it was the charger or the phone but it never happened again and I have 3 of these chargers so...I don't know...just something  to consider....I've had them for a month or two and I never have had any other issues..I monitor the charging periodically just to make sure but never happened again....great for the price and works great.... now I have one for my office, my bedroom and living room for the price of 1 of the other models...great value!"
"The sound is amazing out of this small speaker - better than my $90 Sony bluetooth speaker! I've used it both inside the kitchen while cooking, and outside on the deck with some friends over. It worked exceptionally well in both places, you just have to keep your phone/device somewhat close to the speaker itself. It does have a bright blue light blinking when bluetooth is connected (it blinks the whole time, it doesn't stop) and the first time you hear the speaker talk to you it was quite startling<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review"
I was in love with this case but the magnetic flap thing just stopped working. I'm so mad!!
Easy access to my phone
as described and on time
Fits great and seems like a solid well build case
"Easily applied to phone, excellent clarity, seems a good screen protector. The few bubbles were easily addressed. Recommend without hesitation."
"Just got my order but so far so good.  Easy setup, comfortable, and clear on both ends.  It works the same as my older Plantronics but for half the price."
Nice is a gadget and works grate and easy
Simple and works perfect
"Not anything like the picture.  Cheap, Cheap, cheap!!!"
Great sound super clear
"Nice cute colors, look exactly as advertised. Longest phone charger I have seen but cheap and works pretty good, nothing more I could have asked for 😃"
I really liked the phone but it would not let me download my messages. I called BLU several times and also called my service provider but it didn't help. So now I'm back to using my old phone. Money spent for nothing!!!
I love this colorful phone case. It fit perfect on my phone and was really cool that is has a extra protection for my phone. I love that I can put my cards in it for convenience. The magnet that holds the cover shut works great!! Love this phone case.
Great radio for the money.
"Protection-wise this case is good, however, the black material at the back has already began peeling off only after 3 weeks."
"I love this case. It's slim, and yet it protects the phone nice."
"Very pleased with how durable this case is, come in 2 pieces and hugs the phone tightly. Case is not expensive at all and I love how the pink is a neon color so it stands out. I trust my brand new edge plus in this case. Ships fast."
"Have been using this for a little over a week now while jogging. I am very pleased with it so far, the straps don't loosen and my phone feels secure in the pouch even while running. Would recommend to friends/family"
"A very very handy and great Selfie stick. I wasn't a big fan of selfie stick in the first place, but recently due to the nature of its use i have been slightly won by selfie stick. So i now carry them along as part of my kit...  First of all the packaging was good and secure when it arrived and easy to open and look through the contents. Happy with the way they have been very neatly designed and packed up. It is a really nice product that is very user friendly too. It took me no time to take out everything and look at the using the selfie stick for my first selfie using a selfie stick. The battery was provided in the packing and that is obviously very good or i would have had to run around to find one. The only slight difficulty i had was with the go pro attachment which i didn't know for what and why till i read through some of the stuff. As i have not been a Go Pro fan or user either.  Pairing with the phone didn't take any long at all. It was very quick and very easy. I read through some of the other reviews and people have complained about the difficulty in opening the extension, but honestly if you look into the locking system of how it is assembled or designed then it is a piece of cake. First attempt i had an issue because i was doing a straight pull and couldn't get any longer than one small bit extended. Obviously for the next attempt i had a quick look into the locks and i knew all i had to do was a twist and a turn and thats exactly what i did. Lo an behold the extension was very smooth.  It was then experiment time and i started it using it. I didn't have any difficulty in keeping it to any particular direction at all for easy and quick focus. It was extremely easy to deal with. The remote shutter button is well made and is well designed a clever piece of design i think this means i can use the stick to position my phone and infant take a normal photo with the remote shuttle thing. I would have actually liked to have one on the stick and one remotely operated... hey but thats my fancy world of imaginations. What is there is much more then enough for now.  The stick is extendable up to 6 sections (The one i am using) and what is amazing is that there is literally no shake up or no issues after the extension. Its solid and firm hence proving it easy to get quality pictures. The small rope kind of the thing that can be attached to the end of the stick is also useful. There is a Bag provided to keep and carry the kit which is very good so i don't loose my remote stutter and can always remember to chuck this little bag into my packing for all my travel. The clamp is sturdy and holds the phone securely enough so i am not worried about it constantly.  Will definitely recommend and would suit a starter or a long time selfie fan... :) Enjoy..."
Great backup for travel when you can't always get to a charger.  Recharged my phone quickly.
"The case leaks, the fingerprint sensor doesn't work and the plastic cover doesn't fit tight to face of phone so it makes a popping noise when you push on touchscreen. You also have to push very hard."
"Very nice phone, arrived in timely fashion. Was able to link it to my phone line with no trouble at all. After about a week the microphone quit working and now we use a head set to use the phone. That works fine but can be a little cumbersome."
"The Nexus 5 D820 32Gb is a great phone for the price. However, purchasing one now that they are out of production is complicated. The phone I received was refurbished even though the description did not say that. The description said used, like new condition. I spent hours setting up the phone to my liking only to find out that the wireless charging feature did not work when I went to bed. I suspect that the people who refurbished the phone did not add the wireless charging feature which is incorporated on the back of the case. I suggest that everyone test the major components of the phone upon receiving it. These components are GPS, wireless charging, wireless internet, wireless data transfer by setting the phones back to back, camera, flashlight, headphone jack, wired charging port, tactile buttons, and the front facing light sensor that turns the display off when you hold it up to your ear. I will update this review because I have ordered another phone and I'm sending this one back. Any other hardware components that I've forgotten I will update. I hope this has been helpful and will save someone time. It's better to know if the phone needs to be returned before you spend hours setting up.<br /><br />Update: I received another &#34;like new&#34; phone from amazon warehouse deals and it looked good at first but then it started shutting down like a light switch while I was setting it up. A defective battery was obviously the issue. It would charge to 100% in minutes and last maybe 30 minutes at most. I have almost given up but decided to order one more. I will update when I receive it.<br /><br />Update: Well it looks like I finally got a good one. I'm changing the review from 2 stars to 3. It was a painful experience but it seems to be over. The phone I'm typing this review with has functional hardware and looks good with no scratches. Just what a phone with a &#34;like new&#34; description should be. The battery life is still not like a new phone but whoever refurbished this one knew what they were doing. The other phones were crap compared to this one. I hope you have better luck and get a good phone on the first try.<br /><br />Update: I decided to bump this up one more star because my review should be more about the product than about the problems I had receiving a nexus 5 in &#34;like new&#34; condition. This is a great phone and deserves 4 stars for the value of the product. It would have likely received 5 stars if the battery life was better. It doesn't have some of the extras like IR blaster and removable memory but it is a great phone. Put a spingen slim case and your favorite screen protector on this and it is one slick device. Hope this has been helpful and good luck.<br /><br />Update: The third phone had me fooled for a while and I almost missed the window for return. Something must be wrong with the GPS module because it says &#34;GPS signal lost&#34; while navigating almost consatantly. I tested the GPS and it has a decent signal but it dropps and re-fixes frequently. I have both the Nexus4 and Nexus5 that I originally purchased from Google and they are still working great. I don't know how I'm having so much trouble finding a good used phone. Well, I'm done. Having to return three phones is my limmit. I've dropped this whole experience to one star."
"Great material, works perfetcly"
"The Aukey power bank has a sleek minimalist design and is very stylist. They packed a 10,000 mAh lithium-ion battery inside that will provide about four charges for most smartphones and can charge other devices like e-readers, speakers, anything that takes a USB charging connection.<br /><br />It has two charging ports, one regular one that charges up to 1.0 A and one incorporating Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology at up to 2.4 amps for faster charging of compatible devices.<br />I also like how it uses premium Sony cells that support over 1000 uses and charges. It also has multiple built-in safeguards fully protect against over-current, overcharging and overheating ensure reliability and safety. I like to trust name brand cell much more than no name cells. I'm glad Aukey is being safe and only using high quality cells to protect customers and ensure quality.<br />Like most charger packs, there is a button to press to start the charging process if it doesn't automatically start. It's the same button that you hold for a couple of seconds to activate the LED flashlight, which is handy when traveling or during power emergencies or just for fun.<br />The power bank itself recharges overnight with a USB to micro-USB cable from any powered USB port or adapter. It took me about 6 hours with a fast 2.4A wall charger.<br />In the package was the battery and it came with a clear instruction pamphlet, an 18-month warranty, and micro usb cable.<br /><br />Great product overall! 5 stars for quality and price."
"I am returning this product because the screen protector is not wide enough to cover all the surface.  Meaning, compared to other screen protectors for this phone I've used, this protector was around 2mm narrower than any other ones I've used; and also the button placements are not very exact either."
"[[VIDEOID:68b8fb18eadab93e3cc581c0f02f97c3]] Compared to the tablet stand I have been using this thing is ultra portable. Soft areas for the contact points both for the tablet and the desk or table (whatever surface it sits on) and fast and easy adjustments.<br /><br />I like the slim aspect, the other unit I have is more of a large sheet, a thick sheet mind you. This has a bit more adjustment and is definitely more easily tucked away for travel.<br /><br />See the video for more to include seeing it in use.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
"This charger is great - very compact, and the cable stash space underneath with the velcro-tabbed cable catchers is very usable and stays tidy even with frequent use. Currently I have an iPad, Kindle, iPhone and Pebble plugged into it, and all 4 devices charge rapidly with no issues. If you own an iDevice using a Lightning connector, I recommend investing in a very short cable (you can easily find these on Amazon), because the standard size really fills up the storage space in the base very quickly.<br /><br />The included cables, by the way, are good quality and a perfect length."
Literally took forever to get here it seems. When it arrived it had only included the case and a cloth i did not receive the headphone jack but I don't need one unless im listening to music under water. Hard to type on so I just swipe to type and the edges the of screen do not pick up touch. Pretty bulky and effective I love it but I don't. The cover to get to the sync cable is extremely hard to open I have to shove a bobby pin in it just to open it. Probably would purchase another though
"I thought this would have a iphone 5 charger attached to it. Very disappointing to see that it didn't, but it's cute."
I hate it. Very poor quality. I highly doubt its actually made of aluminum and polycarbonate. Buy an Incase or any other quality cover instead.
"my daughter loves this on her iPhone 6!<br />i admit I was unsure, as soon as I received the screen protector and had her father put in on her phone we were all very happy.<br />my daughter is a bit rough on her cell phones and this will allow for her iPhone 6 to last longer that it normally would.<br />thank you for a great screen protector and for the ease of applying.<br />I would highly recommend everyone purchase this product."
"Wanted to give this thing a work out before reviewing. That said, we did a family 3 day canoe trip with this being our only source for charging and maintaining 3 smart phones.  Started out with unit fully charged, out in the elements. Charger got soaked on a couple of occasions and never missed a beat,  great size, easily fits in a pocket, quickly recharges a stone cold dead phone, recharges fairly quickly in sunlight. The LED flashlight came in handy on a couple of occasions too.  Great little piece of technology able to bring life to the wilderness."
"OK....but just OK. It makes your phone much bulkier and heavier.  The credit card department can be hard to open.  Sure, you want it secure, but I have scraped up my hand and knuckles many times trying to open it.  My other real complaint is that there should be space for three cards and not just two.  My driver's license takes up the space of one card, leaving me room for just one more.  That doesn't work well if you want to carry a work CC and your own personal CC....or an AMEX and something else for places that don't take AMEX.<br /><br />Also, mine has already broken in a spot and I have only had it for a couple of months.<br /><br />I would not buy this product again."
They were cheap plastic my phone would not click in and stay they are not good covers for my phone I sent them back for a reimbursement I'm sorry I had to pay for shipping and handling coming and going if you've got something that's got a soft rubber around that hugs my phone that's what I want... I would love reimbursement for shipping and handling because the cover was such a piece of junk thank you very much will this feedback do any good I'm out money for shipping and handling coming and going because it's a bad product
Works as it should
"Sturdy and functional.  I have an iPhone 5S in a case and it holds it perfectly, with and without the charging cable, so that I can see notifications at a glance without having to touch the phone.  Very handy on my office desk.  So much so that I am about to buy a few more for home.  It will hold most phones, but a few may be too thick to fit well, such as older flip phones and those with sliding physical keypads, or thick cases.<br /><br />While it is perfect for my phone, some users have noted a problem with the clearance under the shelf.  Some plugs may be too long to allow the cord to make a bend back toward the slot in the back.  One solution would be to put the stand on the edge of a block of some kind and loop the cable at enough of a side angle to prevent a kink or unwanted force on the phone's jack.  If there is not enough clearance I would not use the stand with the charging cable.  While it does not affect me, I knocked off a star because of it."
"Ok so I have just received this case and let me right a honest review, first of all I love it. It fits snug on the phone and it feels really nice on the hand. The buttons also press very easily with no problem.<br />HOWEVER, I really really hate the screen protector that comes with it. There are just so many rainbow effects compared to other models that comes with the screen protector( for those of you who don't experience this maybe I might have recorded a defect) and I just wish if this was dustproof they would at least cover the home button and at least the ear piece so that dust wouldn't get stuck in there.<br />In conclusion : I would just rate it as 3/5 because of too much rainbow effect on the screen that bothers me. However, to be fair, everything in this case is nice soI give it 4/5."
Great product for a road trip!
Easy install great product.
"I really like this little cute holder, and my LO loves it too since he doesn't have to hold the phone or place it against any other surface or item to keep it straight as he watches shows/cartoons. I received this holder at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, and the only con is that one hand was not level with the other one; it was kind of tilted a bit, however, it did not bother me much."
It's a hard sell that just protects the back and sides of the phone. It's not really what I expected but it will do the job.
The screen has scratches on it but other than that this phone is amazing.
amazing and i did love it. lived up to its expectation! charges my phone fast.
"When I first recieved the Car Mount in the mail I couldn't believe the size of it. Its very small and compact!<br />Being that I live in the desert I needed a Car Mount that doesn't have a suction cup which requires you to place it on your window. Not only do those place your phone in direct sunlight (so it can heat up your phone) but also the suction cups seem to deteriorate over time because of the sun and the heat. Plus some states I hear won't let you use suction cup mounts on your windshield. The solution to this? The TechMatte PortGrip vent Mount! Not only is it small and compact (which doesn't completely block your vents so that you can't feel the AC, or your vision from the road, for that matter) but it keeps your phone secure and out of direct sunlight so your phone won't get super hot during the Summer months.  It even works great with my LG G4 (which not only has a case on it but the phone itself has a slight curve to it).  The design of the TechMatte PortGrip Vent Mount is simple yet very effective.  You place it onto your vent and then open the little flaps (that can fold down when not in use) which extend outward to fit your phone. The built quality seems very good (with both plastic and metal components being used) for what it is and will hold your phone without having to worry about it falling with its, ever so slightly, padded grips that will hold your phone firmly in place. You can have it so can view your phone either horizontally or vertically (when the phone is placed in between the expandable arms) and it should be able to hold most phones (even with a case) without any issues (except for maybe for the Note line of phones). Myself, I perfer horizontally, so I can use my phone as a GPS while I am on the road.  It also comes in handy when playing music on my phone through my car stereo as it provides easy access to the screen (being that the vent is closer than what a window mount offers so it gives you easier and safer access to the screen).<br/>Overall... I am very satisfied with the TechMatte ProGrip Vent Mount and I highly recommend it to anyone out there wanting something to hold their phone so that they can have easy access to it for GPS, Music, etc. It does the job well, seems durable, and is small and compact enough not to block the AC completely when not in use (so you can leave it in at all times if you wanted to).<br />The price point that the TechMatte ProGrip Vent Mount is priced at, cannot be beat either, because most other vent mounts available are at least double the price and are usually always BIGGER and BULKIER (which will not only block the vents completely... but look plain ridiculous and ugly).<br />The TechMatte ProGrip vent mount is definitely a Five Star product and well worth the asking price... so if your looking for an Awesome Vent Mount for an Amazing price... this is it!"
Great
Great camera! It is very easy too install and looks great.
"It's been a good case for me, no issues at all!"
Works OK text long time to charge
Yes it is a very beautiful case!! BUT I hate that I can't even remove it. It's so difficult to come off.
"Simple product in the scheme of things but-<br />Fabulous: does what they promise.<br />Fast charge of any device - Apple, android etc.<br />I have thrown out my other cheap and not so cheap chargers to use Anker exclusively.<br />We have Anker fast / smart wall and car chargers for both my wife and I.<br />The 2 outputs on each charger is very handy for use when we travel.<br />Highly recommended."
"Great price for spare charge cables for my Nexus 7s.  They seem to be holding up well, I love them."
"Some of these do not charge some of my devices (Kindle, Fitbit & garmin GPS watch) anywhere near as well or as quickly as the ones that came with the product.  I am not an electrical geek, but I do know that despite the device showing it is getting some charge, it may take forever to get a full charge compared to the  USB plug that came with the product.  My Kindle never did get a full enough charge to actually work."
Great case strong protection and low profile
This product stop working within 2 months and now I can't even get a replacement  product is a piece of garbarge not a 100% guarantee will not buy from them again.
worth the price for scratch protection. fits well. will update if i drop my phone on its face.
"I bought this case after purchasing my note 5, first of all the kickstand falls out because the phone is what holds it in place. Once the case is applied properly there should be no more issues.<br />This case is very well designed, the kickstand does the job.<br />It does not add much bulk.<br />I purchased the lilac color for my sapphire black phone, and it looks great.<br />This in combination with the Spigen screen protector, has my phone ready for combat!"
I was given a deep discount to review this product:<br /><br />This works great! Did not realize what a good product I was getting when I ordered it. The readout tells you the state of the car battery which is a cool feature. Definitely worth getting if you need a car charger and it has two ports!
Perfect!  I have this brand of screen protector for my Lenovo IdeaTab so I knew the quality.  I bought this for my daughter's new phone and it fits perfectly.  It goes on super quick too.  We had no problems with this at all.  Great price for a 6 pack also.
"I bought this item six months ago and have grown to absolutely love it. I am starting to care more about solar power and wanted to ease into it to become more energy independent and educate myself in the process. Ravpower couldn't have made it any easier with their great lineup of portable USB power solutions.<br /><br />I typically leave this solar panel unfolded on the dash of my car because that is the best place for me to use it. My car has a rather large windshield with much better exposure than any of my home windows. It fits easily on the dash and is pretty much unnoticed as I drive. In fact I could fit two of these on top of the dash and may do so in the future.<br /><br />I have several of the Ravpower 8400mah battery packs that I rotate through. I charge them with the solar panel and then rotate through them to keep my phone, music player, desk lamp, book light, and other small USB devices charged, all Off-Grid! This way I have one or two fully charged battery packs to work from indoors while one is charging in the car. I simply leave the battery pack plugged into the solar panel until it is fully charged. It resumes charging the battery packs just fine when transitioning from shade to sun or from daylight to overnight to daylight again.<br /><br />I started using this solar panel with just one battery backup. I have since graduated to three battery packs that I actively use. I reached a point where there were bright sunny days and all of my devices and battery packs were charged up. The solar panel was going unused so I started using more battery packs and am gradually replacing more and more of my commonly used devices with USB powered versions.(More USB powered LED lighting is a great example!)<br /><br />This foldable solar panel is sturdy and still holding up well after six months of almost daily use. The panels themselves are well sewn into a heavyweight and durable cloth material. There are two USB ports for added convenience as well as grommets foreasy hanging on a tent, tree or backpack. It folds up to a very slim and lightweight profile for easy portability.<br /><br />I can't think of anything I don't like about how this solar panel functions. It does exactly what it should and does it well I ended up buying a three foot USB extension cable so that the items being charged are down in a shaded area of my car's console rather than on a hot dash board in the direct sunlight. If an extension cable had been included with the purchase that would have been nice.<br /><br />Ravpower is making great portable power products that enable you to keep all of your devices powered up and the folding solar panel is a great way to generate your own power for free wherever you are. Grab a couple battery packs to keep ahead of the game and you'll be all set! Sorry, big energy companies."
I was not happy with this product whatsoever. The pink bled onto everything including my hands and the white part of the case. Also it other people couldn't  hear me when I was on the phone.
"We all know, pictures could be very deceiving, especially on the cover of the packaging box.  Regardless of that, the packaging of this AtomicX headphone pair was high quality.  Besides a very detailed description, list of accessories, and a tech spec, the box itself was high quality, sturdy built carton with a magnetic flip cover - all together a nice presentation.  And once opened, you will find a headphone case with everything inside of it.<br /><br />Starting with a case - this is a pure quality EVA hard shell zippered case, nice slim design.  When you open the case, you see headphones folded on one side and meshed pocket on the other side with usb and audio cables.  Being wireless headphone, it needs usb to micro-usb cable for charging, and also for a dual mode of operation (wireless or wired) - an audio 3.5mm cable.  Both cables were of a good quality, especially audio cable which has thicker more durable shielding, in comparison to junk thin cables I found with other headphones.<br /><br />Obviously, the first thing you notice about the design is that it folds by collapsing inside of the headband.  Once folded, the footprint is significantly reduced and you can fit it inside of a slick headphone case.  I actually found a lot of things about this headphone to be of a high quality.  First of all, headband has a perfect bend radius with a comfortable clamping force.  In addition, it is padded all the way around with a nice soft pleather and extra foam padding inside of the headband where it rests on top of your head.  Headphones are very light weight with an even distribution of the weight.<br /><br />The headband height adjustment is precise, and all the hinges are sturdy with a high quality material.  The bending part of headband actually has a real aluminum metal surface that looks very premium.  Earcups have 360 degree of tilt to adjust comfortably around your ears to fit the shape of your head, and they have a marshmallow-soft earpads.  The earpad opening was comfortable for my medium size ears, but for those with large ears it could be right at the threshold.  But I think it will still be ok due to a soft cushioning that just going to press on top of your ears.<br /><br />All the controls are located in the right earcup and very easy to access.  At the bottom of earcup you have micro-usb charging port (enabling 14hrs of continuous play!!!), 3.5mm audio port for wired connection, and Mic pinhole port for wireless phone talk.  The controls are on the back of the earcup where it's very easy to reach them, including a multifunction Play/Pause/Call button, power led (bi-color blue and red), and volume up/down.  The buttons had a solid click action and nothing was rattling or creaking - solid build all around.<br /><br />Pair up with my Note 4 was flawless, headphones were recognized right away and connected to my phone and media audio without a problem.  Either talking on the phone while wearing these or listening to the music was high quality and I was actually able to use it within 50ft of distance away from my phone (in open space, of course).<br /><br />According to the spec, this model supports Bluetooth 4.0 and apt-X codec - VERY important in order to maintain high quality fidelity of the sound.  Furthermore, it supports all popular BT profiles such as A2DP, AVRCP, HSP, and HFP.  Also, very conveniently it could pair up with 2 devices so you can switch, for example, between wireless listening on your tablet and picking up a call on your phone.<br /><br />Ergonomics, functionality, and comfort of the design is important, but without a good sound quality this package is not going to be complete.  Even with support of apt-X, you can still mess up a sound by using sub-par drivers and poor D/A converter.<br /><br />To my pleasant surprise, iDeaUSA team got it RIGHT!!!  This AtomicX S204 model headphones have a very nicely balanced sound with a decent sub-bass extension, great mid-bass punch, warm detailed mids, and crispy non-fatigue extended treble.  I really didn't expect them to sound that good.  Especially I was very surprised about their soundstage - an average depth and way above average width - a nicely spacious expanded sound.<br /><br />Overall, it was nice to see a company that introduced a product with an original design that doesn't try to look like another &#34;Beats&#34; pair of headphones.  The lightweight comfortable fitment, quality build and slick aluminum design accents, 14hrs battery life, both wired and wireless performance, a premium quality case, and a rather good sound quality makes these headphones a great value under $60.  These actually get my high recommendation!y non-fatigue extended treble.  I really didn't expect them to sound that good.

"First, I was provided a sample product to review and was surprised at how useful the visor was, especially at night and in rainy, dreary conditions.  I had some minor difficulty attaching the visor to my car visor, you really do need two hands to tighten the fit so that it doesn't slide, but in hindsight, that's probably a good thing since you don't want it sliding or coming loose while you're driving.  The visor is quite sturdy, and the lenses are very firm and do not feel &#34;cheap&#34; in any way, like I expected.<br /><br />The daytime dark visor does a nice job, but in all honesty, I don't sue it very much since I generally wear sunglasses while driving anyway, but I tried driving with just the visor and it did a fine job on its own.  My eyes are very sensitive to light due to my allergies, and the visor certainly made driving bearable even without my usual dark glasses.<br /><br />Where this item stood out, however, was the night visor.  As I said, my eyes are very sensitive, and even driving on a rainy, dreary day bothers me and I tend to wear sunglasses on those days as well.  This isn't a great idea as it does hurt overall visibility.  The night visor though is perfect for these situations.  It both brightens and reduces glare from the rain, and mutes the lights of other vehicles at night.  Much better and safer than wearing even a pair of slightly tinted sunglasses.  The visor also comes with a handy lint-free microfiber cloth for cleaning, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />This visor will certainly be a permanent fixture in my vehicles from now on!"
It did take as long as estimated to arrive .. They are much lighter than the one's i have used in the past but do work fine and for the price I would reorder again and again.
Good sub for the price.
"Not quite as rugged as the case for my last phone (an iphone), but some protective value (and more than the average case). I haven't dropped it yet, so can't speak to that in detail. What I can say is that it has a slim design when the holster with clip is not used. Screen protector and all went on smoothly with relative ease, once I figured out how to do it. Completely compatible with the fingerprint reader and s pen, though the case makes it a little hard to remove the pen from phone for use (nothing unmanageable, but annoying.)."
"I've only tested the product with a paper towel inside case.  So far..so good, all is dry."
"This is the perfect low-profile charger. It's a much better way to charge while in the car than to use my car's built in ports. The Dual Port USB Car Charger by Aukey is really something. It not only gives you two ports,but also allows you to charge at the fastest pace even when your using your device. It has great output and can quickly charge my phone back up to at least 30% on a short drive.<br /><br />Sometimes, I would be in the car trying to charge my phone while using it, but the phone won't budge any further than maintain or start slowly losing battery power. Why, I wonder because it's not being charged by a high power charger and my phone has<br />so much battery power needed to keep it performing the background stuff, that it uses more than the adapter was helping to give back.<br /><br />Therefore, with the Aukey USB Charger I was given more charging power than the built in ports on my car. This outputs a max of 2.4A while my car only does 1A.<br />I even now don't have to worry about pulling my phone out of the charger so my passenger can use it as well because of the Dual Ports, we both can charge at the same time and with the exact amount of high performance as one would get.<br /><br />The design is great too and the high quality PCB means you also are protected by overheating, which causes problems for batteries if your charging and it doesn't need to be charged anymore than it is. I love how fast I can charge and how small and portable the device really is.<br /><br />Overall it's a 5 Star product for it's great design, performance, and price!"
Great case
Love this case. Great for consolidation and stylish. I would note some charging cables may not fit on this due to the extra protection. Was very hard to open at first but i got the hang of it quickly and seemed to break it in. I have  dropped it twice and it stood up just fine.
nice phone bling... thanks
Gorgeous case but the black trimming in the picture is a shadow therefore the pic is not accurate. However the whole case is fuchsia color and it had no impressions.
"Yes,it does work on infinity sound with amp. The 1818 harness is not needed,thanks phone guy! Just go blue to blue and white and it works, I dont know if the amp is working but the new stereo is.PS.hey phone guy my name is not BUD! Jack ass. Thanks for the help,1 800 no help."
"This is a great charger, smooth and nice looking it is quite easy to get prepared and works great with my phone. I was surprised that it charged so fast and it was so nice not to have cords all over the place. Great product, well worth your consideration. Product received for a honest review."
"I got this to add to an older tuner that isn't equipped with Bluetooth itself. Other than that, the tuner is great and I didn't want to throw it out just because I wanted to play Pandora tunes directly from my phone through the tuner and attached speakers. I had been using a 3.5mm audio cable, but then I was forced to physically plug my phone into the tuner and leave it sitting on the stereo.<br /><br />This Bluetooth receiver was exactly what I wanted, and so far it's working great. It paired easily, and the audio quality is as good as the wired cable gave me. As a bonus, you can use this as a Bluetooth transmitter (though I won't be using that function). You just toggle the switch on the side to either Transmit or Receive mode (I've only used receive), then plug the 3.5mm audio cable into the audio-in on your stereo. Plug in a micro-USB power cable and hold the button for 9 seconds to turn on pairing mode.<br /><br />While the unit came with a 3.5mm cable as shown, it was pretty short (about 3&#34;) so I used the longer cord I already had plugged into the tuner. This allowed me to position the receiver where the flashing blue light wouldn't distract me. I may cover it with electrician's tape at some point though as that light is fairly bright, and pulses about every 4-5 seconds when you are paired with it. My only other quibble is that while they do provide a USB to micro-USB cord for power, they don't provide an AC transformer (5v/1A - like most modern smart phones use) that you can actually plug into the wall. Luckily I've got a ton of those laying around, so I was able to wire it in so it'll always be ready for use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic device that works great. I'll probably buy another one for my car."
"I bought this for my husband who isn't especially tech savvy. He loves it. It's great that the case can stay on at all times, and when plugged in it will charge the phone first, then the case. It takes the standard USB connector used for most devices as opposed to an Apple charger. The Apple chargers are expensive and knock offs rarely work. Having this case has cut down on the cord clutter and cut time spent charging in half. I love the color we got - blue. It's a really nice looking case in addition to being incredibly useful. Can't believe we waited so long to buy one!"
Love this case
Propmptly got the product and love the idea of this but broke after a few weeks of use!
Great
Great case that fits a number of (older) iPod models perfectly; good value for money. The armband is a bit long.
The tracker quit sending new data to the phone app.  The customer service is horrible.  They want you to keep their packaging for ever for warranty purposes and you have to pay all the costs for shipping.  No phone support sucks.  What a rip off piece of junk.<br /><br />Bought a Jawbone up24 and it had issues.  Contacted phone support they had me return it free of charge and gave me an up2.<br />I also have a fitbit and have not had any problems.  If you want a real tracker and not a piece of junk I recommend getting a fitbit or Jawbone up2.  They work and have great customer support.
"The case is a two part design.  This is important when installing it.  If you read the instructions, you take off the gold outer band, insert your phone in the plastic case,  and then snap the band back around.  Quite easy.  In my haste I didn't read the instructions and I forced the phone into the case without taking off the outer band.  I got it in without hurting the phone or the case, but it was a struggle.  Following the instructions makes it much easier.<br /><br />Since installing it, I've dropped my phone several times (twice on a corner and twice flat on the face), the case has protected it well.  After traveling everyday for 3 months in my pocket (along with change, keys, and what ever else) the leather still looks great.  The gold band has a couple of scratches in it that expose the white plastic it's made of.  But, all in all, it's holding up quite well.  I would purchase it again."
"We purchased a Titan 500 and 600. Both phones have the same issues. Random freeze ups when apps are started, dials random numbers and random disconnects, and the biggest issue; neither phone will stay connected to ANY WiFi network. No other device has any issue with WiFi, yet both phones will disconnect and not reconnect until the device is rebooted. I thought it may be my network until we both encountered this issue at restaraunts and family members houses. Neither phone will read network time, the clocks have to be manually set and randomly switch auto time back on and switch to a wrong timezone. Finally, the GPS is garbage. The phones have difficulty keeping satellite connection and when it does it freezes constantly. It also never fails to detect that you have turned onto every overpass you cross and takes minutes to &#34;reroute&#34; you. I contacted Posh Mobile in hopes there was something I had done wrong that they could walk me through, but their answer was simply &#34;your phone is defective, foot the bill for shipping and allow us 3 weeks to return your phone&#34;. I need my cell, 3 weeks without it isn't an option...<br /> The build quality is fine, touch screen is decently accurate for the price, and the phone is speedy when it wants do be, but too many issues on 2 versions of this device for me to justify the purchase."
I wear this when I run or do other exercises at the gym like burpees.<br />This is very comfortable and it fits my iPhone 5c well even though I have a thin Spigen brand case on it.<br />I like this case because it is easy to use the touch screen while its in the case. The color is bright pink and fun. The arm band is soft and stretchy so it could fit anyone.
Great price and product . Have bought a few of these.
This case is a great case. I want to start off with the packaging. There are some products and companies that do not get enough credit on the packing of their product. This comes in a nice box that protect the case. Majority of the cases that I buy come in plastic baggies. Which I really like the box that this company provides and the protection. I love the case it looks classy. One of my favorites that I have for my phone. This case gives great protection. I always like a phone case that wont slip out of my hands and this case wont. This case does provide the camera hole and other ports where you don't not have to fight the case for that. It does go one easily and I did not have to fight or spend a lot of time trying to get it to go on. I also noticed that it did not slip while putting it in. Sometimes cases are not a great fit and they move around in the case. I will definitely be keeping this case and be using it often.<br />I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
"First off, the shipping timing was impeccable! Secondly, the product was beautifully packaged and the screen protector looks and feels just like my $20 one that just shattered! It was such a good buy, that I convinced my brother to buy one too. Very satisfied."

This is the second one I have purchased.  The first one was about 6 months back.  That phone is still working perfect.  The instructions are super easy and the extra tools have been nice to have on hand for many other repairs.  The shipping was fast and professional.
"This is a great case. Fits my LG Tribute perfectly.  The cover raises off of the phone's screen a little, which is good because that should protect it.  Loove the minty blue border and the antique roses/polka dots. This case is so feminine and both pieces snap on amazing."
"Great, fast charge worked on both a Galaxy Note 4 and a Galaxy Note 5. Charges just as fast as my wall charger that is also Qualcomm Certified."
"I was very disappointed with this case it only lasted about two weeks, cheap material so it started tearing"
Piece of junk. Plugged into newish MacBook to power it and my iPhone freaks out. Works with small apple wall charger and my old 2008 MacBook. Charges slow and low quality connectors. Sticks 2mm out of the phone and it not a tight connection at the Lightning port which causes jiggle and the pins not touching the contacts.
Good product but does not fit my iPhone 6 well.
"This device would absolutely get 5 stars if it were not for some fatal flaws to a TMobile customer.  I now have an LG G4, which costs about twice as much...but is similar...so I will compare.  I liked the ASUS better; however, the calls were unclear...breaking up...even with excellent 4G coverage in the DC/Baltimore area.  I called tech support confirmed settings and changed out the card with TMobile, but it didn't make any difference.  Additionally, I could not get coverage once I stepped into my house.  Both of these issues forced me to change.  The LG G4 shows less signal quality, but calls are always pristine...and (since it is a TMobile phone) I get wifi calling in my home even if signal problems exist.<br /><br />What I liked about the ASUS was the device quality, the performance (better than G4 in my opinion), the battery life was ridiculous compared to the G4's short life, and the camera and software (although the G4 is good or better also).  I was depressed when I had to send it back and when I got the G4...knowing I was paying twice as much for a device that wasn't as good as the ASUS (except for the phone call issue)."
Good product.  Fits the sensor perfectly.
This external battery charger is built for rugged and outdoor use. This are no flimsy or easily breakable parts on this charger. There is also a neat mini flashlight which is helpful when it gets dark.
"This is an amazing product.  The craftsmanship and the quality are outstanding; even the box that it comes in is beautiful!  The portion of the case that attaches to the phone is snug and adds a perfect amount of grip to the phone without adding a lot of bulk.  The rest of &#34;wallet&#34; clips on with a very strong magnet, so you know that the phone will not move.  I would recommend this to everyone and almost wish that a similar quality product existed for my iPad and other mobile devices!"

Great case! Looks great- I have dropped my phone with this case a couple of times and no damage done!
Have to revisit this review.  Last week it started getting very warm and not charging properly.  Had been working great but something is wrong now.  I removed it to protect the iPhone and and so I could charge my iPhone.  Too bad because it had been working so well since I bought i in August.  Previous review - Works flawlessly. May interfere with any existing screen protectors you have in place.  I ended up using a New Trent Arcadia Premium High Quality screen protector from Amazon.  I do wish that it had a textured case because it is slipperier than I would prefer.  That seems to be a failing of all battery cases.  This does not offer a high level of protection so does need a better tactile feel to it.  Give it a Speck Candyshell Grip case surface and it would be perfect in all aspects.
The battery was exactly what I needed.  Good job with a good price.
It is a Great product
Huge and heavy.  Not at all happy with this product.
A very sleek and durable case. It fits the phone perfectly with access to all of its open ports.
Excellent delivery time and quality.  It has an 'Executive' look.  I am very pleased with the product.
"It does not fit my phone with a case at all, but I use the charging cable that came with it."
The product arrived as described its very nifty and I got it over the tile because I could recharge it. However the range is short I could leave my keys on a table downstairs and go upstairs and I get constant messages saying that the ihere3 has lost connection. So I figure it's maybe 25 to 30ft indoors. Besides that the product works as advertised. If I could increase the range so it does not beep all the time when I'm home that would be great.
"This case works great.  It’s well-manufactured, with tight seams and no excess material.  The holes line up nicely, and as others have mentioned, the case does not cover the speakers whatsoever.<br /><br />I’m not a big fan of cell phone cases, but the Idol 3 is quite thin and light, and I had fears of dropping it.  This case provides a much firmer grip on the phone, without adding too much extra weight.  As far as protecting the phone from a drop, thankfully that hasn’t happened, but I suspect it would perform as well as any other rubberized case.<br /><br />The one issue you may have (which is probably common to many cell phone cases) is that due to the case’s thickness, your charger or your aux cables may not fully connect.  My charger connected fine…the only cable I had an issue with was my aux cable, which I use to connect my Idol 3 to the ‘Aux In’ of my car (for music streaming).  I solved this problem by purchasing a $3 aux cable from monoprice.com which is designed specifically for use with cell phone cases (it features a very low profile connector shank).  The monoprice item # is PID 11502.<br /><br />Nice case – highly recommended!!"
This case fits very well. It's flexible enough that you don't have to fight with it
I got these cables and they worked fine. The extra length let me plug in my phone and iPad and would reach the sofa with ease. One still works the other one had the &#34;lighting&#34; end break off after about a month. Even though this cable is thicker then an Apple cable it does not seem as durable. We have had several Apple product and never broke a cable but this thicker non apple cable broke.
I love this case! Its completely see through which is exactly what I wanted! When I first got it the buttons were a little stiff but it loosens.
Great product! I love that I can charge it without sunlight via usb.
"I have it for more than a year and it is very nice, color is bright and beautiful, and it is protective too."
"This like the screen protector that Maxboost makes is a quality product. It is elegant, simple, functional and fits my purposes extremely well. I like the phone in my pants pocket where it is secure from being knocked off the belt with a holster and clip. I have dropped the phone one time and it was protected well with no scratches, etc. I suspect that the place for cards is not ideal for someone who wants to use this feature on the iphone 6 Case. I believe this is a super buy for quality materials and design. A real winner for the consumer."
i only got it a few weeks ago but so far it seems to work very well :) it is small and the perfect size. it was a great price i couldn't pass up. i suggest buying a cord for your phone to keep with the device so you don't have to keep unplugging your real charger just to use the portable charger. i made that mistake. its a great product and if given the choice i would buy it again.
Absolutely amazing!! I love how easy it was to get the case on and I feel like my phone is very protected. The order came so quickly too! I would definitely buy from here again!
Bought this a while ago and I still love it. Very protective for an inexpensive case.
"Excellent phone protection, I have already dropped my phone."
Absolutely love this product. Got one and it was very handy and useful so I bought 3 more. Will likely get another soon.
Great price for such a fashion statement. Easy to &#34;install:. Arrived in a timely manner.
"This belt fits my giant Note 3 with no problem.  I use a Bluetooth headset to listen to music and track my distance on my jogs.  The belt is perfect and I forget it's on.  I'm a &#34;bigger&#34; girl, so I wear it up on my waist or sometimes just below the band of my sports bra under my clothes.  Easy to adjust, even mid-run.  No problem with slippage or bouncing around.  Spend the $10.  It's worth it."
"Moonmini FreeCall LC-B41 Bluetooth 4.0 Headset<br /><br />This is a low cost Bluetooth headset for your phone with some nice features. It has nice extras including a hook to hang over your ear and an insert to lock to your inside ear space. They can be used together as I did for best security. It also comes with something I’ve never seen before. An extra wired earbud that you plug into the main unit to have stereo capability for music. It plugs into the charging port and you route it to your other ear.  There is also a MicroUSB cable for charging and an extra set of ear hooks.<br /><br />It paired to my iPhone just fine. I used it for communication but I wasn’t able to summon Siri for automatic calling. The sound quality was fair to good, definitely not great. Music, even with both earbuds, suffered. There are better music capable earbuds in this price range but that means carrying something extra with you. This headset is a compromise. If you’re listening to podcasts or talk you may be fine with this.<br /><br />Overall this is a good headset not a great one but the price point is very affordable.<br /><br />This product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review."
"Love this speaker. I haven't yet attempted anything water related with it. Sound is really good, holds good charge. Have not used for a phone call"
"If you still have a naked Moto X, get this case. If not, then why are you looking at this?"
"This is a great screen protector. I drop my phone a ton.  I actually cracked the protector and was issued a replacement immediately.  Great product and great seller. I would give ten stars if I could.  This is very easy to apply, the instructions are clear and the packaging is simple and solid.  I highly recommend this brand."
"I guess this is a nice case, but it doesn't even come close to fitting my Galaxy S5 w/ Lifeproof case - I checked all the measurements, but no luck, not even tightly, not at all.  I love my new phone, but haven't been able to find a case that will fit it.  Considering the new size of many phones, I'm hoping someone will begin designing cases to actually fit them.  Very disappointing."
"Awesome case for my iPad Air 2! Fits perfectly! Item arrived,  as described!!"
After trying it out a second time water began to leak in. My iPhone 6 plus did not fit perfectly so I had my doubts but I tried the tester before using my phone and it was working fine. As soon as I noticed the water inside the case I took it apart and no damage was done to my phone so it did prevent a total loss but it's not made to be under water long at all that's why I gave it one star.
Great product rapid charging.  Awesome.
Nice phone holder for the dash or window. Strong suction holds up to my iPhone 6 +
My T404 phone doesn't fit in this case.
Good protection but it covers too much of the screen.  I have trouble getting access to the top line.
"Wonderful leather, beautiful design, protects the screen with a slightly raised edge, fits four cards and removes my wallet from my pocket!<br /><br />I loved this case!! but the stitching on the back started to come loose and the corners also started to peel after a month of usage.<br /><br />Also, Make one for the Sony Xperia Z3+ if those issues are fixed im buying this again instantly for my new phone"
Very good product during exercise
"This mount isn't horrible, but three things:<br /><br />First, it fell out once the first day, just a couple hours after installing it—on smooth, flat Florida roads too, mostly highway driving. I made it a little tighter when I installed it the second time and it's held better since, but still doesn't seem all that secure. I even removed it today without having to loosen the screw at all, just pulled a little and it slid right out. Not exactly confidence–inspiring.<br /><br />Secondly, I knew it would obscure the CD slot and I didn't mind that because I don't ever use my CD player, but I had hoped it wouldn't obscure the rest of the radio quite as much as it does. With the GPS in place I can't see my radio's display at all, can't get to most of the buttons, and even have a hard time adjusting the volume knob.<br /><br />Lastly, it's just too expensive for what it is. A little wedge of molded plastic like this should be selling for maybe ten bucks, but not twenty-five.<br /><br />So to sum up, it's a neat idea, but it doesn't really work and isn't worth the price, so It's going back. Maybe I'll have better luck with the cupholder mount (which is ten bucks cheaper, btw)."
The case is perfect - thick and strong.  The screen protector is great too!
Perfect for an Alpine ILX-007 install in my 2002 Chevy Avalanche
This is a great phone case and its has my daughter initials
My nine year old boy has used this for a few months and it exceeded my expectations for such a low price. It's tough the stand works well only the stylus is not going to stay in the holder other than that its a wonderful product.
"just got the Samsung Level earbuds yesterday.  It paired and connected effortlessly with my Samsung galaxy six.  Required charging first--it does not come with a USB charger --but my phone charger works with it.  Downloaded the Samsung Level App--I did not find any equalizer or other music tone controls--but the good news is--it sounds great as is!  I noticed the phone's control provides only a very low volume for the level and the phone flashes a volume safety type warning.  However, I used the volume control buttons on the level--using the Level's volume control provides FULL volume--you can turn it up extremely high!  Pushed all the way into my ears, there is excellent bass.  In some reviews for the Level, there were complaints the volume was too low--using the Level's volume control buttons resolves that.  As other reviewers noted, these don't stay in the ear or &#34;seal &#34; well.  I would agree the ear bud fit could be better.  I can get them in my ears pretty good but I have noted they easily come out.  I have not tried the spare gel tips yet--but I think these will work out well for bicycling which is the primary reason I bought them--it makes it easy to ride with only one earbud in or neither until a call comes in--for bicycle road safety I never ride with both ears  plugged with head phones since listening for traffic  as well as listening to the bike's derailler after shifting is important.. Using this &#34;neck&#34; set, I don't have to worry about losing them or having a lot of cord dangling.  They are very comfortable for wearing for extended periods of time.  I bought the Samsung Level instead of the LG Infinium because I wanted a smaller size to stash into one of my bike's packs or into my purse when not needed.  Until I find a better gel tip for the Level, I am not sure they will work well for running.  I rated these 4 stars only due to the gel tips--otherwise I really like them and am impressed with the sound quality!"
"I have used this case for 6 months. I loved the slimness of it. I have dropped it a few times, no problem. My one year old pulled it off the table, and my screen cracked in multiple places. It had a tempered glass screen protector on it, so I could still use it, but still....I am now looking for a new case, as this offered NO screen protection at all. Save your money. Find something else."
This charger works great with my Galaxy S6. It works better than the one that came with my phone to be honest. I am very impressed with the quality of the cable that comes with it too. A great charger and absolute must if you have a Quick Charge 2.0 capable phone!
"The battery life is horrible, it overheats, it feels cheap and its slow.  My previous phone was the Galaxy s3 and I loved it. I had high hopes with this phone as a replacement, larger screen, higher resolution, great camera.. but it's been a huge disappointment.  The camera is great, but everything else is lacking. I'm a big fan of the LG brand in general, but I'll never buy another one of their phones again."
The stylus pen arrived quickly and they seem hardy enough for daily use. The stylus works well on my computer and phone. The material is fairly sturdy for the price. The pretty colors were an added bonus!
"Perfect.  No bells or whistles.  Locks onto my bike mount with nary a jiggle.  I wish everything worked the way this thing does...<br /><br />By the way, the bright orange makes it a lot less easier to misplace the phone!<br /><br />Update:  Within nine months, the black bezel ring that surrounds the case started to come off - first the left side, now the right side.  This ring holds the phone within the case.  It's a shame because my previous Rokform case for an iPhone5 could've survived a nuclear blast.  I can no longer recommend this product.  Though it is still covered by the warranty, I simply will not pay for the return shipping - not worth the money nor the hassle."
This case fit my iPhone 5 perfectly and it was a great price with many designs to choose from.
"The Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE sells at the best &#34;Big Box&#34; store for $30 as an AT&T GoPhone.  It is a great business phone, with excellent voice quality for phone calls, and with reliable texting and email on the AT&T network.  Your calendar and emails are always in synch with your Windows computer.  The Lumia 640 LTE has an excellent five inch screen similar in size to the Samsung Galaxy S6 and larger than the Apple iPhone 6.  It sells for just $30 at the best &#34;Big Box&#34; store,  Microsoft stores, and neighborhood AT&T stores.<br /><br />NOTE:  The 640 LTE GoPHONE IS LOCKED TO THE AT&T GoPHONE NETWORK. If you do NOT activate the phone, AT&T will email the unlocking code.  Google for the AT&T device unlocking portal.  Check the box for &#34;non-AT&T customer&#34;.  Respond to the verification email. Within three business days, AT&T will email the unlock code to you.  After unlocking the phone you can use any GSM network, including Cricket Wireless, T-Mobile, and MetroPCS.  The 640 can NOT use non-GSM networks such as Verizon, Sprint, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.<br /><br />BONUS:  Maps for GPS navigation can be stored on the phone, enabling you to use GPS navigation in remote areas far from a cell tower.  You can even use GPS without even having a data plan.  Your maps update automatically, making the Lumia better than many &#34;stand-alone&#34; GPS devices.<br /><br />The Lumia 640 LTE is a Windows phone, so it uses Windows apps, such as Microsoft Office.  Windows apps are designed for business:  phone calls, texting, emails, calendars, navigation, and reviewing documents. A business user will find all of the apps that a business requires.  The Microsoft App Store lacks many of the popular games and social apps that are available for Android phones and Windows phones.  Most Google apps are NOT available for Lumia phones.  However, the 640 provides excellent Gmail service and works well with my Google calendar.<br /><br />The large five inch screen is bright, sharp, and has accurate colors which you can &#34;fine tune&#34;.  Netflix movies look very good.  Voices are loud and clear through both the front and rear speakers and music sounds great through good headphones and bluetooth speakers.  The rear camera takes good photos and videos outdoors.  The front &#34;selfie&#34; and Skype camera is barely adequate even in very bright light.<br /><br />Battery life is excellent for business use.  If you use your phone mostly for phone calls, texting, and checking email, you can get up to 24 hours per charge.  However, GPS navigation and streaming Netflix movies over wifi are battery eaters and can drain your battery in just three or four hours.<br /><br />The 640 LTE has a tiny 3gb of open storage for apps storage, but you can add a 32gb or 64gb microSD card and designate the card as the &#34;default&#34; storage for apps, games, videos, photos, and music.  So, you can have a 64gb phone for just $70 total cost.<br /><br />I have several 640 LTE phones, and they have worked well on AT&T (with GoPhone and Cricket Wireless) and with T-Mobile (with MetroPcs).  I have used both the &#34;stock&#34; Windows 8.1 and the new Windows 10.  As of late March, Windows 10 is still buggy and some key apps (such as TuneIn Radio and Here Maps) have problems with Windows 10.  I would suggest that you do NOT update to Windows 10 for the next six months or so.  Windows 8.1 works great, so give Microsoft time to get Windows 10 working smoothly.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  If your need a phone for BUSINESS, with clear phone calls, reliable texting and email, good battery life, and great GPS navigation, the $30 Lumia 640 LTE GoPhone on the AT&T network is a tremendous bargain.  If you have a Windows computer at home or work, the Lumia becomes an extension of your computer.

"The only reason I don't like this is that it is way too big for my phone.  Nice case, just not what I needed."
"Installs beautifully!!!<br />  Installs like magic, No bubbles, no slippage afterwords, practically invisible.<br />  On installation, I had to reposition once due my unsteady hand, and there was no problem in lifting the glass and repositioning.<br />  Got alignment right on my second try, paying equal attention to bottom AND top notches.<br /><br />Wonderful touch, absolutely sensititive and smoothas if nothing is there.  Very clear.<br /><br />Fingerprints don't occur, any smudges are so far rare. This glass stays very clean on its own for me.  Been using about a month, maybe cleaned it a little with a soft cloth once or twice.<br /><br />Has not scratched yet at all.  And I am not the most gentle person with devices.<br /><br />Does provide a layer of protection for phone face, my belt clip case slipped, phone fell.  An edge on this glass chipped, but phone was okay and the glass didn't move.<br /><br />Will reorder when need another one.  Highly Recommend because I am very happy with this glass."
"For the price, you cannot expect too much. Still, I was disappointed when this case started falling apart after only a couple of months."
High quality material for the price
Complete garbage! Don't waste your money. Held a full charge one time. Offers no protection to phone whatsoever.
"My first impression of these were that they are very light. You barely feel them. Changing the earbud size was a snap (that hasn't been the case with some other brands). They paired easily with my phone and the sound quality is very good. I am not using them for running, but they stay in well for other physical activities. The only problem I have with them and similar styles is that they get hidden behind my hair and people don't know I have them in. This can be good, but has been a bit embarrassing when someone was talking to me and I didn't hear them.<br /><br />I was given these to review but wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair."
Decent screen protector. For the price it's a great product.
This case fits my iPad2 perfectly!  Good quality and nice colors.  Very pleased!
"It works well! It's a great clear plastic phone case. Only struggle is taking it off - it's tough to get off. It's a tight fit when on and works great, though."
"What's great: It's small and compact and can be put anywhere thanks to the adhesive on the mount. Bluetooth means one less wire to worry about. Magnetic mount matches my phones magnetic mount. It comes with a charging outlet that has an extra port for your phone/tablet. There's also a Siri/Google Noe button, although, I never use it.<br /><br />What's needs work: Like every other FM transmitter it has trouble overshadowing other stations. I finally found &#34;The One&#34; after experimenting with stations and music quality is decent. It's a bit muddy and I thought it was Mono output but I've confirmed its stereo. Aesthetically, the shiny plastic look bothers me but that's just me.<br /><br />Overall it's a great product but for thirty dollars I feel it could be improved on. Not gonna list what needs improvement because I know this a cookie cut product being sold under a myriad of names so I doubt my complaint will ever be heard.<br />Also a lot of these experiences will be different depending on your car. Some cars have good speakers and some just use toasters. Consider that before putting a review. I have a Ford Escape 2001.<br /><br />I am keeping this instead of returning it not only because the process of doing so is tedious but also because I feel the other two popular Bluetooth Fm transmitters experience the same issues."
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE! Metal plate works with LifeProof allowing LifeProof to fully snap shut with no excess bulge. it stays on the mount when hitting potholes or off roading. I've never had a phone mount so useful and easy that takes less than a second to place or remove. And it's magnet head is so small I can still access my radio if needed. Works perfect for vertical or horizontal use of phone. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. Husband ordered one too. And if you hear it squeak a little when hitting bumps or lines in road like concrete interstate (bump bump bump), take out of cd slot and reposition. No squeaky sound now. I truly recommend this item."
This was a great product if you are that type of person that always drops their phone than this is the one for you. It came in Great Conditioning and so far it's been perfect
"works fine, my phone doesn't fall apart when dropped and I can tell the difference between my wife's phone & mine"
"They worked for about 2 weeks, on my iPhone 6 has to take off otter box cover to use which was a pain. After 2 weeks message appeared on both phones that it was no longer compatible. Does not work to charge either phone now."
"The Trentium 6S Durable Case for iPhone 6 is an excellent case, but a few minor quirks keeps it from earning 5 stars.<br />1.) This case is packaged in a sturdy retail box, and the components are protected by removable film or what appears to be anti-static plastic.<br />2.) As the picture implies, this case comes with 3 interchangeable plastic back plates (black, grey, and gold), to match the color of your iPhone.<br />3.) This case actually consists of 3 parts:<br />a.) The front screen protector is made of thin plastic attached to black plastic bezel that protects the front, top, bottom and sides of the phone.<br />b.) The back and sides of the phone are protected further by a rubber (TPU) back piece that wraps around the entire phone, but has cut-outs for the Apple logo and camera/flash.  The power and volume buttons are fully covered by this rubber piece.  The silent switch, headphone jack, and connector port are covered by small flaps that lock into place.  The speaker is also covered, but six small holes allow sound to pass through.<br />c.) Finally, the rigid back plate attached to the TPU shell, protecting the camera and flash, while leaving the Apple logo visible, and allowing access to the TPU covered switches, controls and connectors.<br />4.) PROS:<br />a.) The screen protector covers the front of my iPhone better than an Otterbox Defender, because the Trentium seems to fit more snugly than the Defender.  (I have also used an Otterbox Commuter case, which has no screen protection.)<br />b.) The circular opening on the back of the Trentium case also has clear screen protector material on it, so the precious Apple logo will not get smeared or scratched.<br />c.) Overall, the Trentium case is slightly smaller than an Otterbox Commuter case, and much smaller than an Otterbox Defender case.<br />d.) The smooth plastic (polycarbonate) back plate and beveled edges of TPU material allow one to put his phone into front pockets more easily than a bulky, rubberized Defender case.<br />5.) CONS:<br />a.) The clear plastic screen protector material seems to fingerprint oil, smudges and dust more than I would like, but electronic cleaning wipes help solve this problem.<br />b.) Although the ringer silent switch, headphone jack, and cable connector port are covered by locking flaps, the small tabs that should allow one to open the flaps with his fingernails are a little too small and difficult to grab.<br />6.) Final thoughts: I have used this case for about 2-weeks and I like it a lot.  I've received a few compliments like, &#34;Hey, cool case,&#34; or when taking it apart, &#34;Wow, that looks like a really solid/durable case.&#34;  I just wish the design of the flaps allowed easier access to the ringer switch and ports."
"Cover fits phone well and is fairly slim which allows phone to fit in pocket. Kickstand works very well and stores very well, I use it all the time, but only works for standing phone on side, not vertical. Only gave 4 stars because the holster and belt clip are not the best. If you put the phone in the holster in the wrong orientation it actually pushes the power button, very bad place for power button, but should have compensated for that feature. I did not use the screen protector.<br />I would recommend case for the features that I used."
It is a great case. Arrived in perfect condition. Looks exactly like the picture :) It first snug on my phone which makes me happy cause that means my phone wont fall out of it. Definitely one of my favorite covers :)
"Great charger. I use this in my car and it charges great. It didn't come with a USB cord, but I used the one that was provided for me by the Cell phone service. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
All this is is tinted glass which makes the phone unreadable w shades n u have to max brightness your display which kills your battery
Great case.  Color is beautiful.  Protects well.  I highly recommend.
"Went on great, not bubbles, but after the first week, it's already started to lift on one corner and won't reseal.  Installed one on my daughter's Galaxy Avant and it's doing the exact same thing."
As advertise. Not bad for the price!!!
"Apple's new watch is the latest and greatest to come from Apple and, with any new Apple product, comes a bunch of new accessories. Primary among those accessories is a nice, padded case to protect your device. Now, you may not think you need a protective case for a watch, but this protective bumper will be a savior against nicks, scratches, and accidentally hitting your hand on something.<br /><br />DESIGN - The design allows perfect access to all ports and can be easily taken on or off after a bit of practice.<br /><br />COLORS - Coming in a vast array of colors or clear, you can go with whatever suits your needs.<br /><br />PROTECTIVENESS - It seems to do the job. With a raised edge, it'll keep it protected from drops as well.<br /><br />Overall, a great product!"
"Amazing phone the only problem that has it is that is not compatible with metropcs, I change my carrier now to tmobile but is the best phone I ever bought for the performance and the price!"
I purchased two of these are spares with a charger. The charger works great. One of the batteries has swelled so much that the cover cannot close properly on the phone. It was little used since it was my backup in case I had to run out and discovered my OEM battery was low. I know the charger is not the problem since it works great on the OEM battery.<br /><br />Swelling batteries are a fire risk. I do not recommend anyone buy this except for short term use as an emergency spare.
Great phone. Not great battery life.
"This replacement SIM card holder was extremely easy to use. It comes in a static free bag, and even comes with the little tool needed to extract the old one. On the S6, the insertion hole is right next to the SIM card, so you just jam the little thing in there, and the old holder pops out. Carefully place your new holder in, and listen for the click. It also convenient comes with a microfiber cloth, for cleaning all those fingerprints off of your screen when your done. Great product, fast delivery, five stars!<br />I received this SIM card replacement kit at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of it. I was not compensated in any way."
have had this case on my s6 edge that i bough when it was just released.. the case has held up perfectly and has taken a beating.
"So I was pretty excited to get this case. I am always going to the river every weekend with my 3 yr old. We love being in the water and its a great getaway with friends. Yet, my number one worry is my phone getting damage by the water. I usually just ended up leaving my phone in the car because I was scared of something happening to it { phones are to expensive to just replace at the drop of a hat } With this waterproof case, that I did test out in my sink { I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 } I was impressed by the quality. I was scared that there might be a leak or the seal at the top was not that great. BUT THIS WAS AWESOME!!! Even after taking the phone out of the water and still in the case. I was able to text, call my sister {{for testing}} and get on Facebook and Twitter. I didn't have to worry about drying my hands off either!<br />This case is really flexible, doesn't interfere with the screen, and will protect not just from water but from the sand and mud that may be wherever you are. I love this product!<br /><br />[I did receive this product fr free and without compensation to give my honest review ]"
"Formidable case best I have ever owned! The tool to tighten is in the case, they leave the screws loose be careful when unscrewing them with fingers not to lose. There are extra screws in there also Very well made considering where its made. I really recommend it to those who are active with their phones. I don't like the etching on the bezel/rim of the case I love MEI wtf I'd rather it be bare or say anything else really.<br /><br />PK"
"This is a soft silicone rubber outer case that does a nice job in protecting the phone, as does the Ice-Clear screen protector film. However, the case does not grip the sides particularly well, though I have not had a problem with the case slipping off the phone. It does not add appreciably to the overall size of the phone and as such, this would work pretty good in a man's pants pocket"
cheap..broke in a day!!
I love this glass screen cover for my iPhone 6.  It fits all the way to the edges and doesn't finger print like others do.  I am very happy with this purchase.
This product is not worth any amount of money. The left earpiece didn't even work and the sound quality out of the right earpiece was so bad that even for voice chat it is non functional. This is a cheep novelty at best. do not waste your money or time on this product. you would be better off just using the speaker mode on your phone while it is in your pocket.
I received my battery case in a timely matter. Delivery was amazing! So far it's been about three days using my battery case and I must say I'm surprised! It keeps my phone charged and my charge actually last longer then the wall port charge does!
I don't need to say anything about this. Because it's the best product!!
"Going on 2 months waiting for this watch, which I was very excited to get and wear around. But still has not came. Not worth the money!!!! Very pissed off about this product"
I tried to get the settings to work on the Accord but it only shows up as a CD. I contacted customer service but they seemed to have no idea what I was talking about and had no interest in helping me.
This case fits my new Nokia 520 well and seems to provide extra protection for my phone.
"I have had this case for over a year now and I absolutely love it! I am the type of person who honestly drops their phone at least 10 times a day and some of those drops are really bad. But my phone does not have a single scratch! It is honestly amazing. I love that my phone isn't that bulky with the case on. There is an adaptor for using other headphones, but that is the price to pay for it being dust proof, etc. Apple headphones fit fine without the adaptor for me, but my car aux cord, I have to use the adaptor, but it really isn't that big of an hassle for me!<br />As far as the charger cord, I like to use only Apple cords because I have had many problems with off brand cords and as long as the charge isn't super bulky, it should fit fine.<br />I did have to get a new case just last week, but Lifeproof shipped me a new one for free because of their warranty. I needed a new case because the flap covering the charger port broke off because I dropped my phone really hard on the street many times and it finally gave. My phone was still protected, but was no longer dust and water proof. But it was one of the easiest processes I have ever had to do. I went on their website, typed in the serial code of the case, typed a short description of the problem, took a picture of the case and the damaged area, and the next day I got a shipping confirmation for my new case!"
"Really cute case! I got so many compliments on it. It provided pretty good protection, but after a bad fall it cracked and I had to throw it out. Overall pretty good, but not super durable if you drop your phone a ton!"
"my best friend got this for me for my birthday and I just absolutely love it. Mine is pink and it is absolutely gorgeous. The color is so vibrant. (downside the case is clear and so the pink doesn't show as much, BUT it still looks nice.) I haven't had any problems with how it works.  Or how the screen looks or anything.<br /><br />IT'S LTE AND I NEVER KNEW THAT IT WAS SO MUCH FASTER THAN REGULAR 4G.<br /><br />i'm just so happy this phone makes me happy. i am upset that it didn't arrive on my birthday though. i'm actually really mad about that actually.<br /><br />Anyway, the phone is great. Personally, I prefer the buttons to be offscreen rather than touch because sometimes apps freeze (not just on this phone but all phones) and you can press the home button. IT ALSO HAS A REMOVABLE BATTERY WHICH MAKES THIS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY LAST PHONE (Blu Studio X [which is also pretty great as well])"
"s*** quality. bad sound, bad fit, overall bad quality."
You have to have a case for this to work. The picture of the product is very misleading.
"THE BEST PHONE MOUNT MADE !!!!!!!!!!!!  This phone mount is by FAR the best one I have ever seen, and I have used a LOT of them. It holds my Note 3 with the Otterbox Defender case on it with NO problem. And it sticks to ANYTHING!!! Even in the hot summer heat on the windshield it will not come off. I have had it for a couple months and it is sticking like day 1. Buy it!!  You will LOVE IT !!!!"
this is a good case it's made of good marital but the only bad thing it's kind of tight when you put it on. And it's really hard to take off. I notice when I take it off my phone it leaves marks on the edges. But over all it's a strong good looking case
I recieved this case complimentary for my opinion. I love the case and how it looks. Although its just black the ports and buttons are smooth and works great. It comes with instructions on saying how to test it to make sure that it is waterproof. The instructions are in four steps that are simple to do. Overall its great.
Amazing light weight case - perfect for the minimalist techie! Also mine slightly had a hairline crack - I emailed the team for feedback on this.<br /><br />IMMEDIATE response - and they offered to send me a complimentary new case free of charge. NO questions and amazing customer service. THIS is how companies need to function! Thank you again Caudabe!
It was not what I expected.  I leave it sun for hours it will not charge enough to charge cell phone.  Bad product!
"I have had this case for a while, but the back of the case (the rubbery part) started peeling off. I had a completely bare back to my phone which was not attractive. but other than that this is a nice case with working functions."
"I love this case for my Nexus 6. The quality is great; everything fits together neatly; I can fit my driver's license, 5 ATM/Credit cards, plus some money, several business cards, and a couple &#34;10th Visit Free&#34; cards in the compartment behind the main card holder. The wallet easily closes with all my items in it. The magnet is strong enough that it securely grips the case without problem. My previous phone was an iPhone and I used a BookBook case and loved it. With a new Nexus 6, I love this case even more.<br /><br />In full disclosure, I can see some might not like that the Power/Volume buttons do not align perfectly with the cutouts. I, too, was worried when I first started using the case. However, this does NOT affect the ease-of-use of the buttons-- it actually helps prevent accidental presses of the buttons (which was a problem with the stock case that came with the phone).<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is the best wallet case I've ever used, hands down. It's a great product and the price is incredibly low (bought for $12.99 in Aug 2015).<br /><br />Great job, Navor!"
Awesome case! Love the double protection and built in screen cover. I will use nothing but OtterBox for my phones because they have proven themselves time and time again when I drop things!
"LOVE LOVE LOVE these cases.  I purchase them for all of my devices I currently and previously have owned.  I have 3 right now (Iphone, Samsung tablet & phone).  Each case functions the same for each device.  The built in screen protector is not like any annoying other brands I've dealt with where the bubbles show up on parts you've pressed on the screen, requiring you to take the entire case apart and put back together if you get annoyed with the look like I do.  I am EXTREMELY clumsy, and tend to drop my phones all the time.  Never have I had a cracked screen using this case on any device.  For the price you cannot beat it!  I've used this with my LG G3,  NEXUS 5, and 6, Galaxy Note 4, Tab 4, & now my Iphone 6."
"It's a decent product, but the plastic piece at the top falls off easily when the case is open. Other than that, it's a decent product for the money."
Perfect heavy case for iphone
"Sorry, not a good case.  Dropped the phone, from a very low height, and the phone popped right out of the case.  The problem with this case is that it doesn't completely surround the phone around the bezel, like other cases do.  This makes for a very lose grip around the phone.  Returning."
Good case! Used it for a long time without any problems (even after dropping it plenty of times). Really cute too!
My husband has been looking for Bluetooth headphones for his marathon. He is really happy with the quality and overal product. Great price comparing to the others over $100! I will be buying myself one for the gym.
"Fully functional and working product. A breeze to put it in and get it working. It was the second screen I ordered through Amazon, the first being a re-furbished screen which ultimately was damaged, this one worked flawlessly. Just google YouTube and find a video to follow."
"Great quality leather and fita all my items I need on a daily basis.  I store 8 cards, a few bills and my phone in one case.  It's all here.  The cards go in/out Easily without effort but they are not loose.  I would recommend to anyone.  My father just bought one after my recommendation."
"I had the up24, now up2 for a few weeks. I like the design of the up2 better, but other than that I liked the up24 better. The touch sensor on the up24 can get annoying as it doesnt always work right away. Also I am annoyed that the only thing that can be done on the band itself is to switch from active to sleep mode and back. So starting an activity, which I was able to do on the up24 band directly, can only be done now through the app now. Thats annoying to me because I dont always have my phone with me, especially not when I go for a run. Even when i start the activity in the app, go for a run and turn it off when i come back, about an hour later i get a notification asking me if I was moving during that time. Yeah I was! And I timed the activity, so you should already know! Hard to explain, but I just liked it a lot better when I was able to start and stop activities on the band, so the time of the activities was accurate. Overall Im still a Jawbone fan, but I think the old band was better."
"i purchased this phone 4 years ago, i accidently dropped this phone million times, no problem, works like horse :)"
Love this case. It holds 3 cards comfortably. The first few times you use it you need to push the back open with 2 fingers pretty firmly but it works well. I would definiitely recommend it. It's not as sturdy as other otterbox cases but much better than a bumper. I do wish the screen cover was not just an adhesive. It is already peeling up.
absouletly love this product. I get a full day usage without looking for a plug to recharge my phone. I'm also clumsy and have dropped my phone several times and the case protection lives up to what is stated.. Thank you Otterbox!!
"If they would only make the phones during manufacturing with this protector. But since they haven't got a clue, this is the next best thing to prolong the life of the screen."
Very easy to use! Shipped quickly and is an excellent charger. FYI: I use a 2.1a wall plug.
"Love the look and the feel of it!  It's so pretty, and snapped on easily."
So far great product I can hear them over my 1600 roadstar at 75. I did have to take the speakers out of the harness to run and hide the wires but great so far
My son is very pleased with this protector.  Good product!
"I purchased this for my boyfriend in June and after he took it on a weekend camping trip it stopped working.  We figured we'd exchange it.  We did, in July and sure enough, here we are in August and it stopped working.  So I was about to return it for good and get another product, but it's just over the limit of how long I can return the item.  I had to return in by the 12th of August, I believe. Very disappointed."
Works great and seller checked on product after delivery. I am very pleased!
"I've used half a dozen of these from various manufactures. I highly recommend glass screen protectors - just not this one.<br />After cleaning the screen well, product applied without incident. I used normal/dry method for application. It went on straight the first time and I did not need to readjust. All looked fine and well and I was happy with the product but then, after only 2-3 days, the protector started coming up from one of the corners. If anyone has had this happen, you will know the clarity is obstructed when this happens. Over the next couple of days the affect of this &#34;ran&#34; along an entire edge of the screen. My phone is in a wallet case. This shouldn't have happened!"
"I received my product long before the estimated delivery date. The instillation was not as easy as I expected, but there was a card in the package that gave a web address to visit that provided a video on how to install the case. Once I watched the video it was as easy as I originally expected. My only issue with this product is that finger prints show really bad on the screen. I have to clean the screen protector every time I use my phone. There is also a &#34;rainbow&#34; on the protector when my screen is turned off, but that does go away when the phone is on."
Batter life was great for about 2 months then it was back to the quality I had with my old battery. I'll probably spend more<br />money next time on a quality battery because these suck.
FANTASTIC. this armband is great for the six plus. The case is nice too!
I like this case but it was difficult to put on. Anyway it protect my phone
Pretty good external battery pack. i haven't had any problems with it so far. Although it charges my phone slower than i thought it would charge other than that its a dope product.
Not a good product color came off in one day.
"Very fast shipping, perfect fit for the screen and outer edges, although it doesn't cover the curved edges. Very quick shipping also"
"Great sound,good fit,and easy to use"
"Great case, really protects my iphone from falls. Has kept my iphone from cracking multiple times, however the rubber colors gets dirty quickly and the color turns darker and dirty looking. I have owned the Aqua and the Red and would buy another product because the color looks dirty after a couple weeks."
"I bought this brand of tempered glass for the price.  Shipping was quick & the installation was very simple.<br /><br />As for actual quality of this product,  i haven't dropped my phone & i pray i don't, so i can't confirm is it actually works yet.  This tempered glass appears to be just like the much pricier versions I've handled in the past."
"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn’t interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
Never got this screen to work with my phone. Kept saying nand error something?
The best and worth it to buy this Phone foam view flip cover case for my wife Lg G2 Optimus.The style is super elegant and perfectly fit on the cellphone.The cover is fine leather and it has a fabric in the inside.The flip case has a nice color and I can tell the superior durability of this quality.The front has rear hinge that makes to easy to watch and touch when incoming messages or phone call.And the last it has no magnetic on cover where I can easily open when somebody or emergency call coming.I would give my best 5 star of this excellent product.<br />DISCLOSURE:I bought this product for discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
"I wouldn't even give it one star! Horrible case ever! First of all, took FOREVER to get to me and I dropped my phone and my screen shattered, but I guess it's my fault for buying a Otterbox knock off. Now I learned my lesson, I replaced my phone and purchased me a REAL OtterBox case!"
"Horrible,  worthless do not order this case! I got it it because it looked cool and the description said it would mold perfect to my phone for a perfect fit which is crap it's about 1/8in to short on the side so when you put it on it sits and holds other the volume or power button down! You can't even put it on all the way! And the hole in the back for the speaker is way to small it covers half the speaker! Oh and the color is way of said my case was black and grey and it's black and an ugly weird purple color! It's pure garbage don't order it mine is going in my trashcan now!"
My daughter loved this little case. Its great for adding a rubber shock barrier. Not so great for carrying in your pocket. Its more a pocketbook case
"This is my fourth Baofeng.  I have determined that the basic original UV-5R model is, for all practical purposes, as good as any of the later UV-5R line.  I also jumped on this deal because it came with the larger battery.  If it came with a 771 antenna, it really would be a great deal.  Don't know why they don't do that.  All of the UV-5R line having the same configuration, cables, batteries, charging bases, antennas and other accessories can be shared.  I was immediately able to program the radio with CHIRP, using the same USB programming cable.  There is one issue other buyers might want to know.  Repeated use of the programming cable and mic can lead to loss of the built in mic.  It is a very easy fix, which is shown nicely on a you tube video.  You will have to know how to solder however.  If you don't use the mic plugin, you may never have a problem.  All that taken into consideration, I think these radios are great.  For the money, I'm one happy ham."
this is the safest product for your I phone !!
This arm band was the perfect product to inspire me to start working out again! It is a cute pink color (that helps me stand out when I run at night) and stays in place through vigorous workouts.<br /><br />I am upgrading my phone next week so I hope to find a MiNE armband for my iPhone 6 so that I may continue to use such a great product!
"I'm not gonna lie that when I first saw Selfie Stick coming up I think it's kinda obnoxious. But hey,when I try it out man I'm never gonna turn back! The days that I need to rely on the random stranger to take fuzzy and blurry pics for me when me and friends are gathering, ARE LONG GONE! But how do you choose one from all the options? For me it was this model from Worry Free Goodie!  It is new for 2015 and has a few new upgrades over prior models. It is smaller than others, it's size range is about 8&#34;-40&#34;.  This makes it super portable and easily fit in your pocket. The cradle folds down for storage & the top is rubber which will make sure that your phone won't slide out. The cradle will also rotate 270° so you can get the perfect angle to take your pictures.   FYI : It's got perfect stretchability and  secures my  5.5 inch Apple iPhone 6 Plus easily (Even with a big old phone case)   Hands down 5 Stars and would recommend anyone to BUY! =]"
"I like the &#34;grippy&#34; sides and the less grippy back. This case has a nice feel to it. Not sure how much it will protect in a drop, or how long it will last, but... it feels good... if it breaks in a year and I don't find something better, I'd get it again."
"Anker is an absolutely fabulous company. I have bought Anker products for myself and my clients for years, and they've never let me down until now. I have not yet approached them with this issue and it's likely they will make good on it, but I wanted to point out a flaw in case it affects someone else's decision. This battery works perfectly! It fits in the phone well, and the extended back fits perfectly. Others have complained that it looks cheap, but I don't find that to be the case.<br /><br />There's just one little fly in the ointment - The Anker Wall Charger YBY-08A-198 that charges standard size Note4 batteries doesn't work with this battery. And there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't have. The charger is designed such that the battery is placed in it backwards from the way it's placed in the phone. Had they designed it so that the battery is placed in the same orientation as it is in the phone, this extended battery would have worked just fine in the external charger.<br /><br />Anker's products are generally very well designed and engineered, but they missed the boat a bit on this one. The fault is not in this battery, it's in the auxiliary charger. To their credit, they didn't claim it was compatible, I just assumed it was because that would make sense. That's my fault.<br /><br />The battery is great, just don't plan on finding an auxiliary charger for it. I searched Anker's site and was unable to find any mention of this battery at all. Must have been discontinued. BUT if you're only planning to charge it in the phone, you're good to go with this model. I don't use protective cases so I can't attest to how they fit with this battery."
Great case to have for boating. Quick delivery and item as described.
"The kickstand does not work. I've tried every surface possible but so far nothing will keep the kickstand in a place where you can position the phone and watch a movie, write a text, play a game, etc."
Good product
"Not too long ago I was introduced to the company DODOcase. They make some of the most high quality, luxury accessories for technology devices that I’ve ever seen. They strive to create a connection between craftsmen and consumer through their beautiful products. I’ve been fortunate enough to test out a few of their products (Apple Watch Charging Stand, Dual Charging Dock and Organizer, and Leather Laptop Portfolio) and have not been disappointed in any of them.<br /><br />Based off of the success I had with the other products, I jumped at the opportunity to review the Leather and Canvas Phone Clutch.<br /><br />The Leather and Canvas Phone Clutch is a very simple, but elegant pouch that you can carry your phone around in. While it’s large enough for most medium sized smart phones, it is marketed for the iPhone 6, which has a 4.7 inch screen. I had no problems with my phone fitting inside the clutch. I typically at least have a bumper style case on my phone and it fit like a glove. If you have a bulkier case like a defender series case or battery case, this may not work for you. There is a larger size that DODOcase makes, which is meant to fit the phablet size phones like the iPhone 6 Plus.<br /><br />As mentioned in the description, the clutch is made from leather and canvas. The leather is genuine logger’s leather from American Tannery. The leather portion of the clutch is the top flap and the back. The remainder of the clutch is made out of canvas, with the interior being waxed canvas for added protection of your device. Like it’s big brother, the Leather Laptop Portfolio, the clutch has an antique brass snap closure. I’ve not had a problem with the clutch popping open once it’s been snapped close.<br /><br />Because this is meant to be a carryall for users, there are places on the inside to carry credit cards and cash. There is some internal webbing that can be used to keep your cards separate from your phone. In addition to the interior, there is a large pocket along the backside that your phone should also fit into. I did not attempt this as I felt more secure with it in the main compartment.<br />Now that I’ve covered the basics, let me talk about functionality.<br /><br />For about a week, I used the clutch almost exclusively with my iPhone. I really don’t have any complaints. It was great to be able to grab the clutch from my rather large purse or laptop bag and be able to run into the grocery store or pharmacy for a quick purchase. This clutch definitely wins for convenience. Since that initial testing period, I have continued to use the clutch to carry my debit card, rewards card for a local restaurant that I frequent and some cash. It’s great for this purpose, too.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, high quality piece of craftsmanship that I can recommend wholeheartedly to anyone. It comes in two colors – natural or black.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;large pocket along the backside that your phone should also fit into.

"This is wonderful! WARNING! Scratches easily, but looks great otherwise. It can charge my phone and tablet two times each, and then some. Great charger, love how I can charge 2 things at once. The only downside is that it takes like 18 hours to charge."
"Great case,  wish they made this exact case for a Note 4"
"Within 1 month the adapter fell apart...just in time for my window of return to end.  Also, my iphone 6 says it's not an authorized Apple product.  It's worth the extra $10 to get this from a real Apple dealer."
Volume and power buttons are difficult to operate but the case does its job!
"I received my case and snapped it on my phone within seconds.. Love the case, it feels right in your hand and doesn't make the phone thick at all which is important to me.  Would definitely buy again."
"Very nice watch, it has all the android wear features I needed and it always impress everyone, definitely the best Android wear option out there. Only downside is the need to charge it daily."
"Phone fits perfectly and snuggly into case attached to the wallet. ( Must take the back of your phone off to insert phone into wallet.)  Arrives when scheduled. Quality and stitching, good. Inside credit card pockets looks like it may rip after repeated use. Nice big pocket inside and convenient removable strap to carry. Color is nice. Nice strong magnet closure.<br />Very happy , Will purchase in other colors."
"Received package in just 2 days and so far it works great... good quality, fast charging, seems like a very well built charger at a good price"
No complaints. Drop my phone al the time . This case saves my life !
"It was in the case, when I fell from my hand to the kitchen table and the case popped open and the phone shattered."
Great quality
The product says that there is no rainbow adhesions or fingerprints. That is a complete lie! I have to wipe my screen every use because there is rainbow adhesions caused by my oil on my fingers. I would go check other products out before buying this. The only thing that is true is that it is bubble free and it is really clear.
The product did not fit my phone
"I used this same case for my 5, I now have a 6 iPhone.  Very well made, slim, and strong.  I love that I could get it in my favorite color.  I've dropped my phone several time and nothing happen to it."
Works as advertised. It's nice to be able to recharge the phone or any other device with a USB connector.
Great product n fit
Holding up better than the big name cable that came with the gf's phone for half the price.
works well enough
"I enjoyed these headphones quite a bit, and they lasted longer than i thought they would. The actual ear bud that you insert into your ear (the rubber piece) is connected to these headphones, but that isnt one solid piece. It is actually two pieces, not including the rubber, and if you hit something while moving these headphones, it may disconnect and you will only have one working side of the product. Other than that, not an awful product."
This iPhone 6plus cover does the job perfectly!  No longer do I need to worry about scratching my phone when it's in my purse.  True piece of mind- with places for credit cards too!
"For the money, this is a very nice leather band. I have no idea how long it will last but considering the price, I'm not too worried about that right now...a great value."
"Both inside and outside are as pictured - except the back. The picture displayed was intact yet mine came with a gouged out corner. However I realised this was to make access to the stylus easier, so no complaints there, just a shock as it wasn't described."
"I really like the case, but I wish it had better feeling buttons on the volume and power slots. Case looks great though!"
Quick shipping. Good product.
The case does not stay snapped to the phone. It's the right case just not a snug fit.
"This is not your average peel and stick protector.  It bonds very well to the screen and is a perfect fit for my G s6 Edge. No bubbles, very clear, and fits nicely even with a gel case on my phone."
"With the exception of a defective silent control switch, this appeared to be a pretty good solution to my wife's phone antics. Some of our aftermarket higher quality charge cables would not fit through the charge port with the case on as well. We returned the item due to the silent switch not functioning properly - poor design in my opinion - the toggle on the lifeproof switch seems more logical than the merit designed lever. If you don't mind being the &#34;mauled by a tiger&#34; guy in the movie theater - this is otherwise a functional waterproof design."
"Although this product doesn't have much reviews, I decided to give it a try anyway. As soon as I put the back glass protector on, I decided to put a clear case on it to see how it looks. I heard a crackling sound and was adamant that it wasn't the screen protector because it claimed to be extremely thin. However it was the screen protector cracking. Maybe it was my fault for attempting to add a case on top but I wish the product description would be a little more accurate with their measurements to avoid further misunderstandings.<br /><br />P.S. After looking at it a bit more, I also realized that the apple logo on the back screen protector is misaligned and is not actually in the middle of the glass. (Just a heads up)"
This case is so cool. I was in awe when I first saw cases like this that can hold liquid. Now that I have on I can absolutely say I love it.  It fit my phone perfectly and I love the way it feels.  It is so cool to watch and I have to admit leaves me hypnotized. I was looking for a unique cell phone case that no one in my family or friends have ever seen.  This case is definitely unique and something my family and friends have not seen. I received this case at a discount in exchange for a non-bias review. I would totally recommend this case to anyone who is looking for a unique case. Exactly how it is described from the seller is exactly what I got.  They even made sure that the case was very well protected.
Best dam case ever had glass screen protector and then my wife and I got in a argument I threw my phone into the wall hit a 2/4 and bounced on the floor no bend dent or break in my phone what so ever
AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I'm not kidding - these folks contacted me to make sure I was happy and when I told them the cable stopped working on my iPad (but still worked great on my iPhone) they sent me a new one immediately. This is SO much better than most other companies that insist the product be mailed to them for repair. I would absolutely order from this company again and love this cable. Its length makes it very convenient to use.
Good stuff with a cheap price
Not too shabby if you run it in the right settings. I have had this amp for about two years and worked will with the first sub. Started having some popping and crackling coming from the sub so I got a new sub(thought the old one was blown). Put the new sub in with a custom box and still had the popping and crackling. Turns out the amp is under powered for what I was running. Gets really hot when it has to push more than it can. Now looking for a new amp that is suited for the sub. All in all it is a good low price amp and was happy for a good time with it.
Great. Prompt service.
"The case fit well,but the plastic side broke off"
My husband loves it.  Its rugged so it really protects his phone. It's exactly what he needed.
"Had one for over a year which protected my phone on multiple hard drops.  The case itself eventually cracked, but with no damage to my phone.  Ordered a 2nd case to replace the first one.  Best $10 cover out there.  Also, the case looks very professional, looks and fees like good leather, doesn't crack or wear like cheap &#34;pleather&#34; doesn't look shiny like cheap vinyl.  I've had multiple compliments on the case."
"It fits the phone fairly well, and I like the kick stand, but part of the plastic case, (one of the corner tabs) broke off within a couple days."
"they fit perfectly and last a long time,"
Good product. Fair price. Met my expectations .
I've had this case for about 10 months now and it's still in amazing condition. I drop my phone about once or twice and week and my phone nor the case have any damge to them.
Love this item. Super strong and hold great.  Will buy again if this ever breaks. I have a big phone and its hold tight. Best thing I bought in years.
"Well I've tested this case 3 times now since I've got in in July 2015. I also got another similar case from another company (looked identical) however that one failed the first water test. This one still passes. Used it numerous times without any issues what-so-ever. Oh and Thanks for the plastic Pepper, that really helps getting the phone out later on."
I put the case on my phone slid it in the clip and when I took it back out the velvet stuff that keeps the screen from scratching pulled up cause it isn't put there right or good enough
This is the second one like this that I ordered.  I had the first one several months and due to my own rough handling I broke the plastic insert for the phone.  It kept falling out so I got another.  I will never get a dark or black case for my phone again.  This light color is EASY to find in my purse and dark countertop.  I was forever losing my black cased phone in the bottom of the abyss I call my purse.  This is a classic design with a nice little gold birdie bling on the bottom corner.  I love it.  BTW the little strap that comes with it is WORTHLESS.  Throw it out.
Great!!. Better than i expect. It came at time. Thanks!!<br />Sorry for this late review. I'm from Venezuela.
"I got this case because I have really wanted a wallet case. It has exceeded my expectations. I absolutely LOVE this case. It fits really well on my phone and holds all my important cards plus a spot for cash!! I am pleased with the craftsmanship of this case. The magnetic clasp makes it easy to be sure that your phone and cards are protected. It is very stylish, as well! The design is very conventional and cute! I was a little upset that it could only hold 2-3 cards as I would have liked to replace my actual wallet completely. But I can still just run into the store without having to carry in a big wallet or purse since I always take my phone anyway. I would definitely recommend this case to someone who is looking for a stylish, sturdy wallet case for their phone.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Great product, great price superfast shipping."
"I purchased this item because of the price and the reviews....which were mostly by people who got a discount for theirs review. Well it must've come from overseas because it took almost 3 weeks to get here. Packaging looks nothing like what's advertised,in fact it's a picture of a phone but at the top it says for whchat 42... That's not a misprint. I got 1 out of 3 to work right, we'll see if it stays. Overall I'm not impressed."
"I really like the idea of wireless charging. It is very convenient and hassle free. A 3 coil charger is a must otherwise you have to be precise as to where you place the phone. This Spigen Wireless Charger has 3 coils and is well made as with their other products. I have used a few of their product over the last year and was always satisfied with the quality.<br /><br />This will charge your phone horizontally or vertically because it has 3 coils. If your phone is not wireless capable you can always by a receiver like I did for my S5. The receivers can be found for $10 or less for most phones on Amazon. If you do not have a QI enabled phone and buy an adapter pay attention to the output Mah. The first one I bought was only 650Mah. I replaced it with a 1000Mah and it charges much faster. You will need to have a 2 amp wall adapter because there is not one included with this charger. Check the one that came with your phone before you buy one, it may be 2 amps.<br /><br />I keep this on my desk so I can always be charging my phone when I am not using it. It holds it upright which makes it very easy to access while it is charging. I can use it without removing it from the charger. The rubberized gripper secures the phone in place and keeps it from moving when using it on the charger. There is an indicator light on the front that is blue when charging and red when you are not. I have a TPU case on my phone and it will charge with it on. It just takes a few seconds longer to make the connection.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review."
Great case
I bought this item a month ago and it didnt stick properly. Also it got broke completely and i am not able to fix. I will recommend this product to anyone.
I dropped my phone...not a bad drop...and this case completely failed to provide any protection.  My screen was cracked.  I'm going back to the Otter cases that I've used in the past.  Forget the cute and pretty and go with the dependable.
has only worked at ONE trackday. 10 others now and still no laps recorded. the one it worked at it only recorded 50% of my laps. have tried numerous times to contact customer service with no luck. maybe I got a lemmon? maybe yours will work? good luck contacting qstarz if it doesn't. can't believe I paid this much money to record just 32 laps. total waste of time and money.
"As someone who will look up reviews on every product I buy, I spent some time looking up all the available screen protectors available for this phone. You name it, I read about it. Also note I was previously a loyal Zagg user but something about paying their price rubs me the wrong way.  Here is what it breaks down to:<br /><br />Every product review will have the group of people who dislike the product whether it be because they couldn't install it correctly and blame it on the product, use the phone in a manner in which no screen protector will survive, or just didn't read the description well.<br /><br />For under $10, I bought this product. Came with all the necessary instainstallation materials and easy instructions (you need to go to their website to get the video instruction, but hey, they explain in detail on the video how to install so if you want a perfect install, this is the best way to do it). Went on easily, no bubbles or imperfections. I don't even realize that the protector is on the phone. It doesn't go to the edge of the phone book case of the curved glass/frame, but it is completely unnoticeable five minutes after you put it on (I say five minutes because when you put it on, you are like,  what is this, and then forget about it right afterward). This also comes with three protectors!! So if you screw up the first one, or even second, you can try again. If you don't screw it up, you have two other protectors to put on at a later time. Also worth mentioning is that this company explicitly states to call them with any issues. I had none, so I had no reason to call. But, the company seems very willing to make sure that every customer is happy.<br /><br />In summary, the price is right, the quality is right, and there is no reason to spend money on the other guys who charge six times the amount in some cases. This is not a wet install, so if you have a preference for wet, then this isn't your product. But as someone who used wet install previously, I don't see any reason that you should care."
"I've had other Ballistic cases and never had a problem.  I misplaced my other case, so I ordered this.  It was a warm day out and my phone was in my purse...this case has no air circulation and it overheated (killed the battery for a while) my phone.  The material traps the heat, so I returned it."
Love this case! Excellent price and it fits my Note 5 beautifully!
"I had previously purchased and used ZeroEdge® products, so when I was offered a product to do my fair review I jumped on it. It worked very well. Well in a mount, you need easy to mount and unmount the phone as well as mount itself. I used in my Toyota Siena with Samsung Galaxy S6 as well as Note 3. They both worked beautifully. The grip was strong. Overall the mount was strong and very rugged. If you use your phones for navigation or even for a desk stand, this is awesome!"
"This is a battery powered and bluetooth controlled alarm device that I am sure will work for some people, and not work for others. To begin with, the vibration feature could be insufficient to wake some deep sleepers. And the volume of the alarm that this small device emits could also be too low for some sleepers. For those who need to have a clock radio that turns on with a loud blast of the morning radio program in order to wake from a deep sleep, this may not be suitable. But for sleepers who don't require such disruptive alarms in order to wake up, I think it's a good device to try. It works exactly as described here on the Amazon page, it's small and attractively styled, and it has a great deal of flexibility in how the alarms can be set and varied. And it is independent of your local power source, so power outages that might reset or interrupt a clock radio that doesn't have a battery backup will not cause this alarm to fail to go off at the proper time.<br /><br />I mention those points at the beginning of the review because I think that it's important to acknowledge that this is not intended to be the ultimate wake-up alarm for every conceivable person. That's probably an impossible task, in fact. Most people know what works for them.<br /><br />Installation and setup is straightforward:<br />- download the 'SmartShaker by iLuv' app from the App Store.<br />- charge the shaker if needed.<br />- pair the device using bluetooth. The app will now show the battery status of the shaker and be ready for use.<br />- use the app to name the device, set location (for weather), and set alarm times and options. Multiple alarm days and times can be set, to a maximum of 10.<br /><br />I had no difficulty in setting it up and using the app on my iPhone. Everything was intuitive and easy to figure out.<br /><br />I haven't used this for long enough to determine how long the battery will continue to provide sufficient power before it is necessary to recharge it. The description here on Amazon suggests one month, and that will obviously depend upon how the device is set (vibrate, alarm tone, or both), and how often the snooze function is used.<br /><br />Initially I had some difficulty because the shaker was beeping frequently and I couldn't understand why that was happening. I finally went to the manufacturers website, which is very well done, and in reading the FAQ's there I found the following information:<br /><br />The SmartShaker(tm) uses beeps to indication connection and battery status.<br />- Start Sync - 2 Beeps<br />- Terminating app connection - 4 Beeps<br />- Reconnection to app - 2 Beeps<br />- Battery is under 15% - Beeps once a minute<br />- Battery is fully charge - Beeps once a minute (Please disconnect the charger)<br /><br />I had my shaker connected to charge the battery, and when I disconnected the USB cable the beeping stopped. A micro-USB cable is included.<br /><br />I give this 5-stars with the proviso that, as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, this is not going to be the perfect device for everyone. But for those who find this an effective wake-up aide, then I think it's very clever and I think that the great flexibility in controlling it from your phone will be a very big plus.<br /><br />If I encounter any additional points worth noting, as I use this over time, I will return to this review and update it accordingly.<br /><br />I received a sample of this shaker alarm at no cost from the seller and for the purpose of review, and I have no affiliation with either the seller, or Amazon.tion here on Amazon suggests one month, and that will obviously depend upon how the device is set (vibrate, alarm tone, or both), and how often the snooze function is used.<br /><br />Initially I had some difficulty because the shaker was beeping frequently and I couldn't understand why that was happening.

"Love this product. As others have said, it really does make the screen feel smoother than a &#34;naked&#34; screen. Customer service is also excellent. My glass cover chipped after having it for quite some time, but due to the lifetime warranty, they are replacing it as we speak. It is easy to get on and bubble-free. Much nicer way to protect screen than a bulky Otter Box case. Love it!"
The phone has problems and the seller was NO help.
Great case.  Has held up wonderfully and looks super nice.
This is a nice thin case that works fine for my wife's phone. One thing I like about it is the raised edge around the camera that is protecting the lens from scratches. I wish it had mette finish in the back but it is just a preference and not a problem with the case.
The case is what I expected. Does not weight and it is a great protection for the phone.
I had this apple green external battery pack. I love how convenient and portable it is. Everytime I travel I don't have to worry if i use my phone a lot because I could charge it anytime. Battery pack last for 2-3 days!
decent device. One full charge can keep you good for more than 20 hours
